    "# 2016 Sierra Club Cool School Calculations\n",
    "#### Below is the code used to calculate the scores for the Sierra Club Cool Schools Sustainability Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's the general calculation style?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will see that each question is calculated individually and the scores for each question are stored in individual Pandas Dataframes - i.e. the results for question 1 are stored in `df_q1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, question 1 looks to see if a school answered 'True' to the question 'Does the institution coordinate one or more ongoing student, peer-to-peer sustainability outreach ...' in file en_1 (which has been converted into a dataframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the school responded `True`, they awarded the school 7 points, if they said `False` or, left the answer blank, they were not awarded any points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after looping through all of the schools and calculating their score, we store the results in dataframe `df_q1` which represends dataframe_question_1. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Things to look out for\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some of the raw data needed to be converted from  `'--'` to a zero in order to run calculations. For these questions (10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 24, 28, 29, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 63), you may need to comment out (can comment out in Python by entering `#` at the beginning of the line of code you're trying to comment out) if you have already converted the data to zero's (Python will throw an exception saying no `'--'` data exists if you have already run that conversion. This is an example of the code for question 10:  `ac_1[ac_1[sus_courses] == '--'] = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Questions (21, 26, 54) needed to be computed manually, these questions will include a separate csv file. These files are included in /files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exporting to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "There is already a completed CSV file named `cool schools totals.csv` in the main directory, but if you want to export one for yourself, run all the code and the very last cell in this notebook will automatically export a CSV file named `totals.csv`"
