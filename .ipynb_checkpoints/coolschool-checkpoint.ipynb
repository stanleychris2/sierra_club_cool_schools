    "# 2016 Sierra Club Cool School Calculations\n",
    "#### Below is the code used to calculate the scores for the Sierra Club Cool Schools Sustainability Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's the general calculation style?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will see that each question is calculated individually and the scores for each question are stored in individual Pandas Dataframes - i.e. the results for question 1 are stored in `df_q1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, question 1 looks to see if a school answered 'True' to the question 'Does the institution coordinate one or more ongoing student, peer-to-peer sustainability outreach ...' in file en_1 (which has been converted into a dataframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the school responded `True`, they awarded the school 7 points, if they said `False` or, left the answer blank, they were not awarded any points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after looping through all of the schools and calculating their score, we store the results in dataframe `df_q1` which represends dataframe_question_1. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Things to look out for\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions (21, 26, 54) needed to be computed manually, these questions will include a separate csv file. These files are included in /files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exporting to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "There is already a completed CSV file named `cool schools totals.csv` in the main directory, but if you want to export one for yourself, run all the code and the very last cell in this notebook will automatically export a CSV file named `totals.csv`"
