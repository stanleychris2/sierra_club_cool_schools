It was also adopted to keep the baseline used for all other reporting sections consistent.,--,--,,"All buildings on campus are metered for their water usage in some way. Many larger buildings, such as academic buildings and dorms, do not have their own water meters, meaning that a few meters track water usage for multiple buildings. Many smaller buildings, mostly small administrative buildings and residential homes, have their own water meters that track water usage for those buildings only.","All building renovations, construction projects, and new buildings completed since 1992 have low flow water fixtures (1.0 gpf urinals, 1.28 gpf toilets, 2.5 gpm shower-heads, and 1.5 gpm sinks). A few buildings on campus built within the last two years are LEED certified and have more efficient fixtures (0.125 gpf urinals, 1.28 gpf toilets, 1.5 gpm shower-heads, and 0.5 gpm sinks). Some other spots on campus have dual-flush toilets.","The Bucknell Green Fund, a revolving fund that subsidizes student-led projects that make the campus more sustainable and that pay themselves back within seven years, has funded a project that has replaced outdated fixtures in a residential campus home with efficient water fixtures this past year. Additionally, last summer, the Bucknell Environmental Center funded a student to complete a comprehensive assessment of Bucknell's water usage. A complete payback analysis for installing low-flow fixtures for 16 of the highest water-wasting buildings on campus was conducted by the student. Bucknell plans to pursue and fund the renovations project for these 16 buildings this fall.",,,,--,--

The Office of Residential Life contributed the data for the campus housing meters.  

The Physical Plant calculated the amount of non-potable water used for our performance year and baseline year by adding our groundwater use amounts to our surface water pump draw which gave us the total consumptive non-potable water used.  ","All of the residence halls use low flow shower heads and water bottle refilling stations.  Biscayne, Palmetto, and Osprey Halls all have dual flush toilets.

The list contains both native and exotic species that have been screened for adaptability to physical conditions and serviceability, to meet planting needs based on site orientation, drainage, soil condition, and other subtropical climate conditions.  Where appropriate, the best plant shall be selected for a given site, which may or may not be a “native.”",Campus uses extremely minimal irrigation and no timed irrigation systems.,"The water in the chiller plant is a closed-loop sustainable system.

There are water bottle refill stations around campus and using them instead of purchased water is promoted through our EAGLES HEART TAP WATER campaign.

Wetland trees, shrubs and perennials have been added to a heavily visited (by humans and water fowl alike) section of the Duck Pond to reduce bank erosion.
Whenever possible, plants native to our region are selected rather than introduced species. This ensures a food source for wildlife, prevents exotic species from possibly crowding out threatened native species and reduces the need for adding soil amendments, chemical controls and extra watering.
Tree removal policy has always been, plant two trees for every one cut down.","Haverford has two in-ground irrigation systems.

Also, all new construction is to be designed to LEED standards, which include water efficiency credits.” In general, exterior building hose bibbs are also locked to prevent unauthorized use of potable water. ","The University’s general policy is to not use potable water for irrigation purposes, with the exception of the Kritchfield varsity baseball and Egli soccer fields.

- Use of a Clivus Multrum toilet/composting system (that does not require any water service) at the Macoskey Center Harmony House;
- The installation of artificial turf at the SRU football field, which avoids the need for any irrigation at all at that location.
- Incorporating water conservation principles in SRU's Energy Action Campaign ""Small Steps, Big Payoff"", in which we encourage students to reduce their shower time by just five minutes per day to conserve million of gallons of water per year.
