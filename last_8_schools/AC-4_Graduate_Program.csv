The program is designed to meet the needs of students currently employed in the field, recently completing an undergraduate degree, or anyone interested in a career change.

Florida Gulf Coast University upholds a strong emphasis on environmental issues, and places a unique importance on environmental sustainability. Our Masters Program offers an integrated study of ecosystems (uplands, wetlands, estuaries and coastal systems), environmental education and public outreach. We offer small class size, hands on research activities and opportunities for professional development via attendance to professional conferences, and internship opportunities at various local, state and federal agencies.

The core of the program focuses on:

Understanding the science of ecology
Utilization of scientific methods
Application of the concept of sustainability.",http://www.fgcu.edu/CAS/EnvSci-MS/,Environmental Studies (M.A.),"The M.A. Environmental Studies has an interdisciplinary focus encompassing the natural and social sciences.  This foundation is necessary for understanding the complex, cross-disciplinary problems faced today by environmental policy decision-makers. 

Students gain a thorough grounding in methods, applications, and natural sciences, in addition to a core of courses in common to the field.  Students may choose an emphasis, within fields including: human populations and their interactions with the environment; effectiveness of environmental analysis and protection institutions; and analysis and resolution of the pressing environmental issues faced by modern society. 
We specialize in educating students in the application of scientific information to policy analysis and management decision-making. Environmental Studies finds a productive complement in the University’s M.S. Environmental Science, a sibling degree program that emphasizes scientific research of the natural world. Environmental Studies students choose to partake of the same science-based courses taught by our experts in ecology, marine science, and environmental biology. Every student completes a thesis: a piece of independent scholarly research, in close collaboration with a faculty mentor, that makes an original contribution to the field.

Graduate study in Park and Resource Management combined with current work experience in the field offer excellent preparation for professionals interested in leading others who have dedicated their careers to protecting and preserving America’s parks and other natural and historical areas.
 
The program is designed for currently employed professionals in park and resource management who are interested in enrolling as degree-seeking students at the graduate level. Courses are taught via the Internet exclusively. For this reason, program candidates must have access to an internet-capable PC or Macintosh and an Internet connection (recommended 56k or higher).
 
The program can be completed in two calendar years. Students may begin the MS program in either fall or spring semester. Two courses are offered each semester fall and spring. Internships are usually completed in the summer.

The program now benefits students who are interested in working at non-formal educational institutions where they will be providing programs for students and teachers, and where they will be emphasizing curriculum and program development.  Since environmental education is frequently integrated into the curriculum, rather than addressed as a separate subject, the program helps students develop those competencies while increasing their understanding of societal interactions with ecological systems. 

The online environmental education program consists of 30 credit hours.  Students complete eight courses (three credits each) as well as six credits of internship.
