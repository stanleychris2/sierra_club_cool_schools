Service-learning connects students to the community and the classroom to the real world. Through service-learning students are both learners and teachers, sharing themselves and their knowledge and, in turn, learning from the clients and the environment where they serve. Because service-learning is such a powerful teaching tool and because service-learning sets the stage for continued community involvement, University founders established service-learning as an undergraduate requirement. We call our service-learning program EaglesConnect. http://www.fgcu.edu/connect/

Students admitted to FGCU as first-year students or lower level transfers must complete 80 hours of service-learning as part of their graduation requirement. Students admitted as upper-level transfers must complete 40 hours of service-learning as part of their graduation requirement.

Students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree at another institution and are admitted to FGCU to complete a second undergraduate degree must complete 40 hours of service-learning as part of their second degree’s graduation requirements. Students who have completed a bachelor’s degree at FGCU and are re-admitted to FGCU to complete a second undergraduate degree have already fulfilled the degree requirements for service-learning; however, if they register for a class that has a service-learning requirement, they are obligated to complete it as a component of the course’s requirements.

Agreement and Verification forms are used to document service-learning hours. The FGCU student transcripts show the total of service hours students have completed until they’ve reached their 40 or 80 hour requirement.  Then it is listed on the transcript as COMPLETED.

Recognition is also given to students who complete over 400 hours and demonstrate a commitment to an agency/issue for the Excellence and Civic Engagement Award. (http://www.fgcu.edu/Connect/9810.asp)
",True,"CAMPUS BEAUTIFICATION DAY
The FGCU Staff Advisory Panel partnered with Tree Campus USA to host the first Annual Campus Beautification Day.  The event was held celebrating Florida Arbor Day and brought attention to the FGCU Tree Orphanage, an area created from trees saved and relocated from construction sites across campus.  The joint effort involved bringing together staff, faculty and students working toward the common goal of beautifying an area of campus.  

On January 25, 2014 behind Griffin Hall and Merwin Hall approximately 30 participants contributed over 120 hours of service for this event.  Here are some of the highlights of the day:
-Volunteers planted 325 native species to enhance the walkway behind Merwin Hall from Edwards Hall to Griffin Hall.  The Florida Department of Forestry donated 50 plants toward the project with Physical Plant providing the remainder.  The following native species were included: Firebush, Coontie, Beauty Berry, Wild coffee, Milkweed, Dune Sunflower, Walter’s Vibernum, Yellow Lantana, Simpsons Stopper, Tampa Verbain, Mahogany Trees
-The Colloquium Coordinator provided student naturalists as team leaders and educators so participants could learn about the natural environment on campus, the naturalists also shared information about the semi-annual nature trail cleanups and other opportunities to enjoy the campus ecosystem.  
-Physical Plant provided logistical support, and is the main contact for Tree Campus USA activities on campus, hosting many campus tree plantings since 2009.  Because the volunteers were such excellent workers, the plantings went quickly leaving time to add plenty of mulch and to pick up litter throughout the surrounding area as well.  The hope is to garner some donations for tables and benches to create more seating to enjoy the beautiful shaded area. 

MAKE A DIFFERENCE DAY
Make a Difference Day took place on Oct, 26th 2013 at FGCU's Soccer Field.  FGCU and Wells Fargo provided 900 hours of services Saturday to eight area not-for-profit organizations.  Some 200 students, 75 Wells Fargo team members, 25 FGCU alumni and 25 faculty and staff members volunteered across the region for the second annual event hosted by the FGCU Foundation, Alumni Association and Center for Civic Engagement and Service Learning. (http://www.fgcu.edu/CRM/makeadifferenceday2013.html).
Here is an overview of some of the work accomplished on campus that day:
-5 designated planting sites were beautified with over 12 different native species including  Cocoplum, Green Buttonwood, Firebush, Bald Cypress, Slash Pine, Red Maple, Leather Fern, String/Swamp Lily, Blue Flag Iris, Pickerel Weed, Florida Gamagrass, Pitch Apple, and Laurel Oak   
-Over 240 native items were planted 
-Over 35 trees and/or bushes were named 
-Participants had the opportunity to plant a tray of herbs. (Basil, chives, cilantro, dill and parsley).  

TREE TRANSPLANT
On April 15, 2014 in the area spanning  from the Library Lawn Lake to Sovi Lake, approximately 25 students and 5 faculty and staff contributed over 60 hours of service.  Some event highlights are as follows:
-Removal of trees from Library Lake and replant them at Sovi Lake for the areas affected by the Library Lawn construction in the summer months.
-3 native species were transplanted:(30 small cypress trees, 5 water lilies, and 10 clusters of alligator flags).

Its purpose is to encourage and recognize meaningful student involvement, maximize and support intentional learning that occurs as a result of student involvement, complement the academic experience by encouraging further involvement and purposeful reflection, and to serve as a search tool for students wishing to connect with a multitude of involvement opportunities at Laurier. It is its own record of community service achievement 

The CCR provides students with a validated and authenticated record of their involvement during their university career, and provides them with a tool to share and communicate their co-curricular involvement to potential employers, on graduate school applications and for grants and bursaries. This record of involvement complements the academic transcript by providing students with a tool to help them identify, evaluate and reflect on the learning that occurred as a result of engagement in co-curricular activities.",--,,http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=1934&e=0,"Time period is from September 2012 to April 2013.

Community service participation has been calculated using the number of for-credit students participating in Laurier's Centre for Community Service Learning and the number of students who participated in not-for-credit hours using the Co-Curricular Record. 

A total of 1368 students participated in Community-Service Learning over the Fall 2012 and Winter 2013 semesters. This information was provided by Rebekah Rempel, the Community Service Learning Coordinator. Community Service-Learning (CSL) integrates meaningful community service with classroom instruction and critical reflection to enrich the learning experience and strengthen communities for the common good. 

Number of students gathered from the Co-Curricular Record are those who have participated in 'Laurier Community Service Initiatives"". These include groups such as LSPIRG, the Student Philanthropy Council, SBE Laurier Day and the Welcome Centre. The Co-curricular record is a student self-reporting tool, whereby students must add their positions by a specified date every year (after which they are verified and approved by staff members). These numbers only include students who have added these positions to their CCR, so it does not reflect the exact number of hours actually completed by students, as many students forget/do not add their activities before the deadline.  
There were a total of 250 approved positions under Laurier Community Service Initiatives for the 2012/2013 academic year. CCR information was provided by Bailey Gross, the Student Leadership Coordinator. "
