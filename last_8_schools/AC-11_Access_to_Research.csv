Community and Collection Policies

Scholars Commons @ Laurier is a co-venture of Laurier Library and the Laurier Press, but includes the active participation of numerous units, including the Office of Research Services and the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies. Scholars Commons @ Laurier content consists of collections produced by defined communities of Wilfrid Laurier University.

Licensing Policies
Non-Exclusive Deposit License

It will be necessary for users when depositing into Scholars Commons @ Laurier to sign a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license agreement. This will appear in the submission template. This grants Scholars Commons @ Laurier the right to distribute scholarly works online and to migrate these works to new formats in the future if necessary. No transfer of copyright will occur as a result of this license.
Creative Commons Canada License

Creative Commons licenses are Web-based agreements whereby authors can release some of the rights they are automatically assigned by copyright law. If the creator is the copyright owner, he or she can specify conditions under which others can copy, distribute, or modify his or her work, provided due credit is given.

When submitting an item to Scholars Commons @ Laurier, users have the option to apply a Creative Commons license that will:

    Allow or bar commercial uses of a work
    Allow or bar modifications of a work

In the case of Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs), Scholars Commons @ Laurier automatically applies a CC BY-NC-ND license (Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, No Derivative Works) which bars both commercial usage and modifications of the item. However, if the author is of the opinion that a different license better serves his or her purposes, he or she is welcome to contact the repository administrator about this.

Although Creative Commons licensing may apply when a contributor is submitting directly to Scholars Commons @ Laurier, as is the case with ETDs or faculty research, some communities within Scholars Commons @ Laurier, for example subscription journals, may have additional policies regarding licensing. If these additional policies preclude the use of Creative Commons licensing, the contributor may not apply such licensing without the approval of the community.

It is important to note that one can apply a Creative Commons license only if he or she is the copyright holder or has express authorization from the copyright holder to do so. The Library, The Press, and Creative Commons do not provide legal advice or services and assume no legal responsibility on behalf of copyright holders. For more information about Creative Commons licenses, please visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ or contact the repository administrator.
Memorandum of Understanding

All communities falling outside of Faculties or Departments, including journals and centres, will be required to submit a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which outlines the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved. The MoU is provided by Scholars Commons @ Laurier and has been agreed to by both the Library and the Press. It may be revised to better meet the needs of specific communities, but these revisions must be approved by both the Library and the Press before the MoU is accepted. A community cannot be established until the required MoU has been submitted. Failure to do so in a timely fashion will result in significant delays.

{ top }
Access Policy

Some items in the institutional repository will be considered free for all to view, in accordance with standard “open access” principles, unless otherwise negotiated with the Scholars Commons @ Laurier staff. In these cases anyone may access full items free of charge. Contributors may also request to have access restricted to members of the Laurier community, for example. Under negotiated circumstances, an item can fall under an “embargo” in which access is blocked, preventing the ability to view the item. Items can be embargoed for one or more years before defaulting to open access.

Open access is not mandatory for all contributors, particularly in the case of publications such as journals which operate on a subscription basis. In the case of some series, such as journals, a portion of the content may be made open access while the remainder is restricted for a set period of time to be determined by the community or series editor.

{ top }
Privacy Policy

Wilfrid Laurier University collects, uses, discloses, and retains personal information pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The institutional repository collects personal information from users who are involved in the submission of content and metadata and users who subscribe to the institutional repository alerting service. For further information please contact the repository administrator.

{ top }
Preservation and Withdrawal Policies
Format Support

We wish to provide support for as many file formats as possible. Over time, items stored in the institutional repository will be preserved as is, using a combination of time-honoured techniques for data management and best practices for digital preservation. As for specific formats, however, the proprietary nature of many file types makes it impossible to guarantee preservation. Although we will recognize and support as many known file formats as possible, we strongly encourage submitters to use open file formats such as PDF (Portable Document Format) and PNG (Portable Network Graphics) whenever possible, given the difficulties associated with preserving proprietary formats.
Withdrawal Policy

All items submitted to Scholars Commons @ Laurier will be retained indefinitely and Scholars Commons @ Laurier will try to ensure continued readability and accessibility. Items may not normally be removed from the repository, but it may become necessary to withdraw items from Scholars Commons @ Laurier.

Acceptable reasons for withdrawal include:

    Proven violation of intellectual property rights, including copyright violation or plagiarism. Copyright violation includes failure to obtain permission from third party copyright holders
    Any other legal requirements and proven violations, including any work that infringes upon the rights or privacy of an individual or group or is found to contain libelous material
    Any proven violations of Wilfrid Laurier University policy
    Falsified research
    Other reasons not expressly stated here upon approval of a written petition. In such instances, a written request must be made to the repository administrator, who will then present the request to Library and/or Press Administration.

The content can be withdrawn

    At the request of the author
    At the University’s discretion
    At the Library’s discretion
    At the Press’s discretion
    At the community’s discretion
    By legal order

Changes or modifications to deposited materials are not permitted. In the event that an updated version of a work is available, this may be deposited in Scholars Commons @ Laurier and an appropriate note will be added to the metadata record of the previously deposited item. The revised version is subject to the current author submission guidelines and Scholars Commons @ Laurier’s policies.

When a work is withdrawn, it will become inaccessible but the metadata record will remain. This is to prevent broken links and to ensure that citations already made are verifiable. A note will be placed in every metadata record indicating that the item has been withdrawn from the collection. Although it is possible to delete an item by requesting this action through BePress, Scholars Commons @ Laurier does not delete items as this eliminates the metadata page and will lead to error messages and subsequent confusion.
