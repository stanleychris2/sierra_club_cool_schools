CISR has a dedicated portfolio of stocks on which it votes proxies and and may sponsor shareholder resolutions. CISR may also make recommendations for ESG investment policies to the Investment Committee of the Board of Managers.
Major Points include:
a. Explore ways to invest its capital to affect positive Environmental, Social and Governance(ESG) impact. To this end, the Committee will select and maintain a portfolio of public equities in corporations for which CISR believes there are possibilities to effect ESG progress through shareholder activism. 
b. Engage students in voting proxies on shareholder and corporate resolutions for the CISR portfolio of stocks that align with the Committee's goals for positive ESG impact. 
c. Consider opportunities to sponsor or co-sponsor shareholder resolutions that it feels will have significantly positive ESG impact and will garner significant investor and corporate attention.
d. Engage the students and broader Haverford community in a conversation on environmental, social and governance (ESG) of importance and provide guidance on their application to Haverford's broader investment activities.","John Taylor (Chair)-Trustee
