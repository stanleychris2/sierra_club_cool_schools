The Federal Pell Grant is awarded to undergraduate students who have not previously earned a bachelor's or professional degree. The amount of the award is based on the students' Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and their enrollment status. Students are eligible for a full-time award when they are enrolled in a minimum of twelve credit hours per semester; they receive a prorated award when they are enrolled in fewer than twelve credit hours per semester. To qualify, you must demonstrate exceptional need. The maximum annual award for 2013-2014 is $5,645. 

Elimination of Year Round Pell Grant - Receiving a Federal Pell grant greater than 100% of the annual award is no longer an option beginning with the 2011-2012 Award Year. For example: A student who was full time for both the Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 semesters will have no remaining Pell Grant eligibility for Summer 2013.

Lifetime Eligibility for Pell Grant - New regulations effective July 1, 2012 limit the receipt of a Pell Grant to a lifetime limit of 12 full-time semesters.  All previous semesters at other colleges/universities will be included in the total.  A student also becomes ineligible for a Pell grant if they earn a bachelor’s degree prior to reaching the 12-full time semester limit.  This limit will be tracked by the U.S. Department of Education.

A recent study by the College Board determined that, as of 2008, only 16 percent of Latino and 28 percent of African-American men ages 25 to 34 had obtained an associate degree or higher. That compares with 44 percent of white men and 70 percent of Asian men.

Southern Scholarship Foundation (SSF) offers rent-free scholarship housing for qualified students demonstrating academic achievement (with a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA), financial need (as identified on the FAFSA), and good character. Scholarship recipients obtain an ""Education for Life"" by living in a home-like setting with students representing a variety of backgrounds and cultures. Each scholarship house maintains an environment that is drug, alcohol, and smoke free with quiet study hours. Students work in a cooperative partnership to purchase and prepare meals, and also assume responsibility for all household tasks. Students do not pay rent, but are responsible for their fair share of the basic household expenses such as food, utilities, and internet. Each student contributes approximately $950 per semester and saves up to an estimated $10,000 each year in living expenses. This includes 4 hot home cooked meals Monday-Thursday and food for the residents to prepare on their own for breakfast, lunch & snacks. It is not just housing for the residents – it is their home away from home!

OSU also has early college high school partnerships in which high school students simultaneously complete high school and an associate’s degree from the local community college.  Students who complete their degree through this program are admitted to OSU and offered a tuition scholarship or need-based grant.","The Diversity Achievement Award is a competitive award offered to entering undergraduate freshman and transfer students aimed at building upon the diversity and educational goals of the university. Evaluation of award application and financial need are also factored into selection process.

Generally, OSU's model is a Shared Responsibility Model which was adopted in 2009. The Shared Responsibility Model ensures that students that receive/qualify Pell Grants from the Federal Government will not pay any money to attend OSU. The Shared Responsibility Model works such that the state will offer some grant money to those that receive Pell grants and then OSU will pay the difference of the amount left after the Pell and OOP (Oregon Opportunity Grants) have been paid out.

OSU also works closely with the OSU Foundation and the Benton Community Foundation to make sure there is need based scholarship money available for students. Additionally each department within OSU has their own scholarship programs with a mixture of academic and need based scholarships and grant programs.

Oregon State University shares concerns with students and their parents over the importance of keeping a college education accessible and affordable. We recognize that access to post-secondary education, declining college affordability, and a high proportion of students who fail to graduate from colleges in a timely manner are critical issues for academic institutions in Oregon and nationally.

At Oregon State, we are committed to effectively address these issues in timely and on-going ways.

The university continues to build an increasingly diverse and inclusive student community. To help the state advance towards its 40-40-20 goal, the university has increased its enrollment in the past three years by 20 percent, ensuring access for qualified Oregonians. At the same time, Oregon State works hard to attract high achieving students from Oregon high schools and community colleges to ensure that we retain them in the state.  And we are committed to maintain affordability, and yet improve the quality of education we offer students, and reduce the time it takes for a student to earn a degree.

To help achieve these outcomes, Oregon State has:
•	Provided support to more than 2,800 students each year through the Bridge to Success program, which covers full tuition and fees for students in the program
•	Raised $150 million for academic scholarships through the Campaign for OSU in collaboration with the OSU Foundation.  Each year, more than 4,000 students receive donor-funded scholarships and fellowships totaling more than $7.5 million.
•	Consolidated business services and academic units to reduce administrative costs and direct as much funding as possible to the delivery of educational programs that allow on-time graduation.

The Institute is held during the spring semester and it is composed of a kick-off luncheon, eight Friday afternoon sessions and a graduation luncheon. 

Faculty who successfully complete the Leadership Institute by attending all sessions receive a $500 stipend and are presented with a certificate at the final reception. Moreover, the Leadership Institute participants are matched with a mentor to support their career and leadership development. The mentors can be internal or external to UTPA and may or may not be in academia. Finally, upon successful completion of the Leadership Institute, faculty will be eligible to apply for an administrative Faculty Fellow position for the following academic year, along with other possible professional development opportunities.","The University of Texas-Pan American GEAR UP Project.

We are unique in that we also offer the Dream Weber Program for students who are unable to receive full funding from the Pell program.  The Dream Weber program provides free tuition and general student fees to students whose annual household income is $40,000 or less by using a combination of federal and state financial aid and money given to the university from generous donors.  The purpose of the Dream Weber Program is to help students complete a college degree — which will improve their earning potential throughout their lives.","The Student Support Services student advisory board has met with several deans this semester and is also asking department heads/professors if their students are first generation (a trait closely linked to low-income families) so that the program can begin explaining to the professors the unique needs of first-generation/low-income students.

","WSU has 4 TRIO programs that work at some level to help low-income students traverse the culture of higher ed. TRIO is a set of federally-funded college opportunity programs that motivate and support students from disadvantaged backgrounds in their pursuit of a college degree. Over 850,000 low-income, first-generation students and students with disabilities — from sixth grade through college graduation — are served by more than 2,800 programs nationally. TRIO programs provide direct support services for students, and relevant training for directors and staff. TRIO programs provide the following:

Extended Hours Preschool and Toddler Programs are available to students, faculty and staff for children age 2-5.  Extended School is available for students of WSU Charter Academy and community.

The Hourly Childcare Center is a part of the NonTrad Student Center and is a state-licensed facility that provides hourly care to WSU students' children (ages 2-9 years old) while they attend classes.","1) The Nontraditional Student Center is intended to assist nontraditional students (25 years or older, married/divorced/widowed, or a parent) in making a successful academic and social transition to Weber State University. The center is designed to support students' academic progress and social adjustment to the WSU environment by utilizing university departments, faculty and staff, programs, and student organizations to provide assistance and encouragement. It is our vision to provide a welcoming, friendly, and comfortable environment. Our goal is to create a center that helps all students feel recognized, valued, and completely connected to the larger Weber State University community as much as possible.

2) We offer pre-college access and outreach programs that include K-16 partnerships and encourage under-represented students who are traditionally non-college bound to pursue and successfully complete a post-secondary education that meets the mutual needs of the university, public school system and community.

    Develop and implement strategies for better coordination and linkage of k-16 pipeline outreach and transition activity partners for underrepresented students.

SSD insures Weber State University's compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable regulations and guidelines under state and federal law associated with access for individuals with disabilities.  The scope of our services is limited primarily to program access and the rights of people with disabilities to an equal education. The program's responsibility for architectural access is limited to advising appropriate campus and state agencies regarding known and/or anticipated architectural barriers.
This department provides specialized services, technology, and advisement to meet the specific needs of each qualified disabled student. These services cover all generally acknowledged types of disabling conditions including certain cognitive and emotional problems (subject to documented verification) in addition to visual impairments, hearing impairments, and mobility impairments. Individualized service programs are designed specifically to fit each student's needs and abilities. SSD supports a strong philosophy of individual independence and self-determination.

SSD serves as a resource for both the campus and surrounding community. The staff is well versed on the ethical principles and established federal guidelines related to the rights and responsibilities of people with disabilities. Students as well as faculty and staff can request advisement from highly trained personnel about issues related to disabilities. We also provide a wide range of adaptive equipment and technology designed to assist people with disabilities. This equipment may be made available to the public on a limited basis.
