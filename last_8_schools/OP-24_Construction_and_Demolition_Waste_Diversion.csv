least Silver Certified building. As such, there are general requirements and procedures for compliance with certain U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED Prerequisites and
credits needed for the project to obtain LEED Silver Certification. 

The Waste Management Plan is detailed to assist the project team in taking the necessary steps to fulfilling the requirements for these prerequisites, in order to divert all scraps and waste from landfills and back into the production stream for recycling into usable products. The Waste Management Plan is designed to make sure that the subcontractors working on the construction of the AB-8 building does not arbitrarily dispose of chemicals and garbage in such a way and to minimize our recycling potential or to adversely affect the environment during the construction of this building. During the construction period there will be various containers on site specifically for concrete, paper/cardboard, plastic, metal, wood and un-recyclables. Subcontractors will be required to separate their waste into the appropriate container as required per their contract. There will be no food or beverage allowed inside the building, with the exception of water. All eating and drinking will be confined to a Manhattan Kraft designated area outside of the building. The details of the Waste Management Plans will be strictly adhered to during the construction of the building. It is our guidelines to make sure that every person working on the project is aware of the necessary precautions needed to be taken while performing the scope of their work, during the construction period.","This data is from 2011-2012 and includes the waste from Marieb Hall's construction.   

FGCU has committed to certify all future building construction LEED Silver or higher, so we will continue to measure these materials and collect this data."

Further, all major renovation projects must be built to at least a LEED certified equivalent. A mandatory component of LEED certification is for construction contractors to “provide an accessible area which serves an entire building and is dedicated to separation, collection, and storage of materials for recycling” and to create a construction waste management plan, with targets for recycled and reclaimed materials. To receive full points in the Construction Waste Management section of LEED, a waste management plan must be developed to quantify material diverted away from the landfill. To receive one point in this area, 50% of all construction, demolition, and land clearing waste must be recycled and/or salvaged. To receive two points, an additional 25% of construction materials must be recycled and/or salvaged. All capital construction and major renovation projects at OSU which were surveyed for this report diverted at least 50% of their waste from the landfill.   

OSU goes beyond LEED standards on most construction projects.  OSU Construction Standards emphasize environmental best practices throughout a construction project, from design to waste reduction and diversion. These same standards are applied to small projects that don’t follow LEED guidelines as well as large projects that do. 

For College of Ag Sciences projects and facilities, the common in-house design practice is to lay out projects utilizing standard material sizing in an effort to reduce on-site modifications which results in a lower volume of waste and reduces the overall labor costs.",--

Recycling program works with local and regional businesses to divert as much material as possible from landfills.  Recycling program hosts annual sales to re-purpose items not used on campus.  Any usable materials are salvaged from remodel projects and either reused on campus or sold for re-purposing.,--
