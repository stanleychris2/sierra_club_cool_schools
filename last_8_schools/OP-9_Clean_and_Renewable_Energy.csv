FY15 provided additional capacity at the Student Experience Center's roof mounted 48kW solar PV and the first full year's production of 2857.77kW ground-mounted solar.

Previous notes: The  Solar Trailer is a 1800 watt solar array with nine Sanyo 200 watt solar modules.  Hatfield Marine Science Center has a pole mounted 1.1 kilowatt array.  Kelley Engineering Center has a roof mounted 2.4 kilowatt array.  Dixon Recreation Center has a kinetic energy system which utilizes 22 pieces of gym equipment and has a total generating capacity of around 2000 watts.  

Since 2013, five large grid-tied, ground-mounted solar electric (photovoltaic) arrays have been installed on agricultural lands operated by Oregon State University as part of “Solar by Degrees,” a large-scale photovoltaic power program coordinated by the Oregon University System.  OSU was the first to install and have operational solar arrays. See the OSU press release: http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2012/dec/osu-planting-seeds-%E2%80%9Csolar-farm%E2%80%9D-campus-part-ous-program

The five arrays cover more than twelve acres combined. Three are in Corvallis two are at OSU properties elsewhere in the state. The 35th Street site is the largest, at around six acres and 1,435 kilowatts. It can be found west of the Corvallis campus on the Campus Way bike path. The 53rd Street site is 289 kilowatts and is located adjacent to the bike path just east of the Benton County Fairgrounds. The Salmon Disease Lab site, with a capacity of 482 kilowatts, is located adjacent to Trysting Tree golf course just east of the Willamette River, off the main campus.

The two locations outside Corvallis are in Aurora, Oregon and Hermiston, Oregon. In Aurora is the North Willamette Research and Extension Center (NWREC) farm across from Charbonneau Village on Miley Road. The Hermiston Agricultural Research & Extension Center houses OSU's only Eastern Oregon solar location to date. All five sites were developed in partnership with the College of Agricultural Sciences, to which the property is assigned.",399.07,"An evacuated tube solar hot water system on the Kelley Engineering Center preheats domestic water, supplying approximately 50% of the building's domestic water heating needs.  The International Living and Learning Center also has a flat plate collector solar hot water system which is estimated to be able to provide 6,625 gallons of domestic hot water per day, which averages over 50% of the annual hot water use for this building.

The grid-tied PV system at the Macoskey Center is located southeast of Harmony House. The 2.4 kW PV array is constructed from 20 Evergreen Solar EC120 12v PV modules and uses a Sunny Boy 2500U PV 240V AC Intertie Inverter. 
The array faces south and collects direct sunlight. The angle of the array is adjusted seasonally for maximum solar absorption. 

This system is tied into the local utility company via a net metering system. If the system generates more power than the house is using at any given time, it feeds back into the utility grid and the Center is credited for it (the meter turns backwards). Conversely, if the house load is greater than what the PV system is generating, we can draw power from the grid.Additional small PV systems power a  rainwater collection system and pumps used in an aquaponics research project, but the electric output of these systems is not monitored or included in our renewable energy  reporting.
.
Wind Turbine System:
The wind turbine system at the Macoskey Center is located on the ridge behind the Market Garden, to the east of Harmony House. The turbine is part of a grid-intertied system, which provides an emissions-free source of electricity for Harmony House.
Feasibility and siting of the system was based on a one-year study of wind speed and direction, carried out by an SRU graduate student. The reduction in on-site renewable energy reported this year is due to the wind turbine being out of commission for the past year.

",18.0,150 gallons of renewable biodiesel fuel is produced each year from used cooking oil and use to fuel tractors and/or other grounds maintenance equipment. Waste wood from campus operations is also collected and used for supplemental heating of the Harmony House at the Macoskey Center for Sustainable Systems Education and Research.,--,NA,25590.0,"Slippery Rock University participated in a state system of higher education elecricity procurement process that purchased approximately 15% renewable energy through the FY11.
