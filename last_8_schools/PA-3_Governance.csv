Executive - The Executive Branch exists to facilitate the day-to-day functions of Student Government and ensure adherence to the Student Body Constitution. This consists of the Student Body President, Student Body Vice President, Student Body Treasurer, Chief of Staff and the Executive Cabinet who operate to complete the initiatives of the Executive Branch.

Legislative - The Legislative Branch is a voting body of students that is elected or appointed to appropriate the Activity and Service Fees (A&S) granted to Student Government by the general student body in fees assessed each semester. The Student Senate passes bills into law by way of voting in open meetings to the public held every week to conduct business. The Senate also serves as a forum for ideas and a voice for student opinions and concerns. Led by the Senate Executive Committee, the Senate is the representative voice of the students, for the students.

Judicial - The Student Body Supreme Court is the official judicial branch for Student Government here at Florida Gulf Coast University. The Supreme Court acts independently of the Executive and Legislative branches and ensures the necessary checks and balances are in place within Student Government. The Supreme Court’s primary role is to maintain the integrity of the Student Government Constitution at Florida Gulf Coast University, and to make sure all members and branches of Student Government act within their powers allotted to them by the constitution.The Supreme Court is comprised of a Chief Justice and four (4) Associate Justices.

The mission of the Staff Advisory Council (SAC) is to facilitate effective communication between the Staff, the President and the Administration. As a proactive partner in the University’s Shared Governance processes, SAC will provide a forum that will directly address the issues and concerns of the Staff at Florida Gulf Coast University, and strive to ensure a campus climate that reflects a strong, enthusiastic and positive quality work life.

History

The Staff Advisory Council (SAC) was created in the year 2000 by President William Merwin as a way to promote open and effective communication with staff members and the University leadership to support the vital role of staff in the decision making processes at the University. Upon its inception, SAC consisted of fourteen (14) members. As the University continued to grow, the Staff Advisory Council expanded its membership to include additional representatives. In 2004, two members were added for a total of sixteen (16) and the most recent change occurred in 2009 when SAC was expanded to include twenty-four (24) members.

Membership

SAC currently consists of twenty-four (24) elected councilmembers and represents approximately 675 staff. SAC membership includes twelve (12) Support Personnel (SP) employees and twelve (12) Administrative and Professional (A&P) employees who each serve a two-year, staggered term. Elections are held on an annual basis in the spring of each year and all newly-elected members begin their terms on June 1st. Exceptions include members who are appointed to fill vacant positions.

SAC member seats are allocated to provide for representation in each University Division. A Division is defined for representation purposes as follows:

President's Office, Advancement, Athletics
Administrative Services & Finance
Academic Affairs – Non-College
Academic Affairs – College
Student Affairs
At Large
Communication with Administration

The Vice President for Student Affairs serves as the Staff Advisory Council’s liaison to the President’s Cabinet and shares SAC’s recommendations and ideas with its members. SAC recommendations come from motions and resolutions adopted at SAC meetings and from the regular meetings held between the SAC president and the SAC liaison.

Communication with Staff

Staff Advisory Council representatives meet on a monthly basis to discuss issues and concerns which impact staff. In addition, SAC communicates with the staff by providing important information and updates on its website, including overviews of SAC committee meetings and re-caps of the SAC president’s meetings with the liaison; sending all-campus email messages to staff and faculty; posting important updates on its social media page; and by utilizing an established communication tree.
