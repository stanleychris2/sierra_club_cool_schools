This includes philosophical research and curriculum and program development.  This work takes place in a variety of educational settings and geographical locations ranging from local to global.  The scholarly activity includes books, journal articles and book chapters, and presentations.  Much of our research and writing is in the field of Earth Charter scholarship. The Center has established an international reputation in this field.

Lean Sigma:

Lean focuses on identifying, reducing, and eventually eliminating wasteful and non-value added activities within an organization. By applying lean principles, an organization is able to increase its through-put, reduce waste and costs, and improve its profitability while at the same time increasing its customer satisfaction and improving its own employees' satisfaction. Waste is anything that is not absolutely necessary to add value to the product or service being offered.
Lean strives to create systems and processes utilizing the least amount of resources including people, equipment, material and inventories, budget, and facilities. The success of lean is highly dependent on its principles being understood by all employees and those employees being involved in its applications.

What is Six Sigma?
Six sigma is about reducing variation in every process and eliminating errors. It starts by asking fundamental question: ""What is critical to our customers?"" and then concentrates on ensuring the organization's products and/or services meets those critical needs each and every time.
Florida Gulf Coast University is the leader in providing lean sigma training in southwest Florida. We use local trainers who are experts in their various fields and are familiar with the regional area and who have many years of experiences in working with a broad array of businesses and organizations.
The course will provide each participant's project a cost savings, revenue increases, and/or cost avoidance of over $35,000 black belt, green belt, yellow belt, and white belt.

Building Influential Relationships:

You have no doubt noticed that most successful people are also likeable people. This is especially true in the world of business where a ""hard sell"" is less effective in the long run.

Relationship building is key to any occupation; it's a fact that people will elect, support, and gravitate toward those who convey positive, constructive traits. These are individuals who usually do more listening than talking; can be introverts as well as extraverts; and know that trust is a key factor in any relationship.

You will gain not only insight into your skill sets, but also practical, clear strategies for increasing your communication talent.

Key Topics Covered:
	Identify the 8 rules of likeability and how these apply to you
	Assess your own personal communication/interpersonal style
	Recognize and be able to handle customer and co-worker concerns and objections
	Practice the art of conversation and trust building

Certified Public Manager, Levels I – VIII:
Florida’s CPM program consists of eight four-day training sessions (Levels 1-8). In addition to the classes, participants are also required to complete out-of-class readings, projects, and comprehensive examinations. CPM training is experiential based, with an emphasis on small group activities and a balance between theory and practice. The curriculum covers the full spectrum of management, beginning with individual performance and gradually expanding to broader organizational issues and public policy. FCPM recommends taking the levels in sequence, as subsequent levels build upon the knowledge and experiences of preceding levels and assignments. See link to PDF document in ""Current Schedule of Workshops"" section.

Objectives:
•	The Certified Public Manager (CPM) program is a nationally-recognized, comprehen-sive training and development program for public sector managers at all levels of state and local government. 
•	The CPM program aims to professionalize the practice of public management, in much the same way that other professionals (such as CPAs) have organized themselves. 
•	Today, many public agencies are moving away from traditional management and embracing transformational leadership. The CPM program incorporates state-of-the-art theory with practical applications. 
•	The vision of the CPM program is to create reflective practitioners who apply advanced managerial techniques to real-world problems, and to foster learning organizations that use new knowledge to improve the way they govern. 

Code Enforcement, Levels I - IV
The Florida Association of Code Enforcement (F.A.C.E.) was established in 1989 and is devoted to the advancement of the profession and practice of Code Enforcement in Florida through (1) education and training for its members, (2) a four-tier certification program, and (3) exchange of ideas, information and technology.

Staff, students, and faculty of all colleges and universities in the State are invited to attend. At our last meeting in March, 2014, we discussed ways that we could collaborate more on competitive events such as RecycleMania, Game Day Challenge, and Campus Conservation Nationals. We discussed the idea of hiring a Utah Higher Education Sustainability Coordinator to help coordinate our efforts and then we shared successes/challenges with the various sustainability projects we are working on. Sometimes formal presentations are made and oftentimes the meeting is a more informal and collegial discussion about what efforts have worked and failed. 

In addition to the formal annual meetings we contact one another for ideas and suggestions throughout the year. For example, we have been speaking with sustainability staff at the University of Utah frequently to discuss how they successfully set up their farmer's market because WSU is planning to start a market this fall. Students at WSU have also been in contact with other students at Utah State University and University of Utah to talk about how to launch a fossil fuel divestment campaign on campus. And many of the State's institutions contact our office regarding our energy efficiency projects.
