The Building Envelope Group provides project support for the structural, building enclosure (roofing, waterproofing, cladding), civil site, and landscaping design of a facility. The Building Systems Group provides project support to the mechanical, electrical, plumbing and system controls design of a facility.

The engineering staff develops and maintains technical design guidelines for OFPC and institution use for the project program requirements. Technical construction support is provided when requested by OFPC field personnel. Consultation and participation in special institution studies, are provided upon request by the institution.

The Construction Services group assists in monitoring of the building commissioning process and the project safety program.  Monitoring of the commissioning process occurs during the initial design, construction and acceptance project phases.  Coordinating and monitoring of the project safety program is accomplished through routine site visits, safety performance statistic analysis and development of contractor requirements.
