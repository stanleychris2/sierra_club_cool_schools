In a conscious effort to recognize its role, responsibility and commitment to the community regarding environmental stewardship, Bucknell University’s Procurement Services department will give preference to purchasing goods that are:

•	Durable, as opposed to single use or disposable 
•	Non-toxic, minimally toxic or biodegradable
•	Recyclable
•	Manufactured locally (minimally within the state of PA)
•	Manufactured with minimal waste
•	Free of heavy metals
•	Eligible to earn LEED credits
•	FSC certified
•	Chlorine free
•	Energy Star, Green Guard, Green Seal, or Green-e certified
•	Low VOC content
•	Made from rapidly renewable materials 
•	Delivered with reduced packaging

These goods shall be selected whenever reasonably practical: the practical goods are readily available; the preferable goods can perform their intended function generally as well as a non-preferable one; and the cost of the preferable goods are either approximately similar to that of non-preferable goods or their higher initial cost can be justified on the basis of long-term benefits.

Thesis and Dissertation Submission Policy:
As of 2013, all theses and dissertations must be submitted digitally. Printed copies are not accepted.   ","Due to printing machine malfunctions and the decentralization of our paper purchases, the policy set forth in 2009 to purchase 100% recycled content  paper is no longer followed. 

Departments are now responsible for purchasing their own paper.  A new policy has not yet been implemented to ensure that departments are purchasing recycled content paper.  However, all printing defaults remain set to two-sided impressions and to decrease the page margins campus wide to decrease the amount of paper printed.

Established in 1993 as a response to concerns over global deforestation, FSC is an independent, non-governmental, not-for-profit organization established to promote the responsible management of the world’s forests. FSC certification provides a credible link between responsible production and consumption of forest products, enabling consumers and businesses to make purchasing decisions that benefit people and the environment as well as providing ongoing business value.

We partner with FSC certified offset printers and the majority of the jobs we project manage are printed with the logo indicating it was produced in an FSC print shop and at the very least on recycled stock.
