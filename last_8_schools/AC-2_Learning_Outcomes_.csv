Completing the University Colloquium is a requirement for ALL Baccalaureate degrees. (http://www.fgcu.edu/Catalog/regdetail.asp?FMID=Registration+and+Records&page=20)

University Colloquium 2013-2014 Catalog Year

FGCU has structured its curricula to emphasize the interrelationship of knowledge across disciplines and to provide students with the ability to think in whole systems. A three credit hour course, University Colloquium, brings together students and faculty from all disciplines in an interdisciplinary learning experience. The university’s guiding principles and values are discussed in this course, and students are expected to develop critical thinking and communication skills. Because this course is required for all undergraduates, the University Colloquium is housed within Undergraduate Studies.  It is a writing intensive course and students are required to complete ten hours of service-learning related to the natural environment as part of the course.

The University Colloquium: A Sustainable Future

Conceptual basis for University Colloquium
Adopted January 15, 1997: Dean’s Council Meeting

We have made a commitment as a university to make environmental education an integral part of our identity. One of our university-wide outcomes is that all students will develop “an ecological perspective.” A way to accomplish this perspective is to devise a course, or group of experiences, with an environmental focus that all FGCU undergraduate students must complete, and in which faculty from all five colleges would be involved. Because “ecology” applies to our total living space and interrelationships, human and natural, it is relevant to all our disciplines and professions. Thus, an ecology course would touch on all the university-wide goals and outcomes, and more. Students would not be introduced to FGCU values, they would participate in them.

Goals:

The University Colloquium is an interdisciplinary environmental education course designed to explore the concept of sustainability as it relates to a variety of considerations and forces in the environment. In particular, we will consider ecological, social, ethical, historical, scientific, economic, and political influences. The course goals are:

To provide a ""sense of place"" and an understanding of the unique ecological features of the environment of which you are a part;
To assist in developing an ecological perspective and a commitment to community awareness and involvement in order for students to know the issues related to economic, social, and ecological sustainability, analyze and evaluate ecological issues locally and globally, participate in projects requiring awareness and/or analysis of ecological and environmental issues;
To provide experiences to assist in moving toward achieving the university learning goals of effective communication skills and critical thinking skills as well as the university’s stated mission of “practicing and promoting environmental sustainability and “encouraging civic responsibility”;
To enable a practical understanding of sustainability, of environmental education, and of ecological literacy.
Student Learning Outcomes

Students are expected to:

Demonstrate an understanding of environmental issues through writing and class participation.
Critically analyze environmental issues from economic, social, political, and ecological perspectives.
Describe the unique ecological features of the area and analyze Southwest Florida’s unique environmental and ecological challenges.
Demonstrate a practical understanding of sustainability, sense of place, and ecological literacy.

","The Certificate in Sustainability is a 12-credit certificate  that targets non-environmental majors and includes a service component as part of its capstone course.

The program consolidates 30 existing courses into classes offered within the categories of environmental stewardship, social responsibility and economic prosperity. Students must pass one course from at least two of the three categories and complete the capstone experience to receive the certificate.

The new program aims to give graduates an edge when interviewing for jobs since many corporations need a greening coordinator, even in industries such as theatre. Professors from different departments, including geography, biology, parks and recreation, economics, history and philosophy will teach the classes.

The certificate is a product of the President's Commission on Sustainability.

""The idea was to develop an interdisciplinary program to give students across campus the opportunity to learn more about sustainability,"" said Langdon Smith, professor of geography, geology and the environment. ""Increasing the number of courses with a sustainability component has also been a goal of SRU's strategic plan.""

http://esutrgv.wix.com/esutrgv","1.  Graduates of the Environmental Science Major and B.S. Undergraduate Program can demonstrate the use of analytical and technical tools used in finding solutions to environmental sciences research questions.  They can also apply professional evaluative methodologies and appropriate environmental laws and regulations for impact analyses and environmental problem solving.  Additionally, students develop and enhance the following cognitive skills:  a.  Explain and apply fundamental environmental sciences theories; b.  Identify multiple dimensions of environmental science issues; and  c.  understand and apply knowledge of regulations to environmental issues.

2.  The Environmental Science Minor provides students with an applied knowledge in environmental science which empowers them to work with environmental federal or state agencies, non-profit organizations or institutions, or for-profit commercial industry or consulting firms. Additionally, the coursework is intended to prepare students for portions of professional certification reviews or examinations.

3.  The UTPA Environmental Studies Minor promotes environmental literacy and sustainability and raises awareness of the effects of daily decisions on how we interact with animals and plants and how we use natural resources such as water, air, and soil.  It takes a holistic ecological perspective, reflecting the recognition that human activities are dependent upon natural processes and that humans are a part of interconnected systems. It is broadly interdisciplinary, encompassing courses from the humanities, social sciences, health and human services, sciences, business, engineering, and public policy. It enables students to identify environmental problems, communicate across disciplines, and promote sustainable solutions. Students can explore relationships between global ecology and our South Texas environment, and also examine the relationships among social inequalities, negative environmental impacts, and environmental justice.",http://portal.utpa.edu/utpa_main/daa_home/cosm_home/esp_home/esp_undergrad,--
