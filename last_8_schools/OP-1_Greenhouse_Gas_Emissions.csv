It was chosen because it is endorsed by the ACUPCC and is very easy to use. The Calculator is an Excel workbook designed to facilitate the following tasks: Conducting a Greenhouse Emissions Inventory, Projecting Emissions into the Future, and Evaluating a Portfolio of Carbon Reduction Projects (2). It allows the user to input data in readily available units (e.g. miles, kWh) and to determine related equivalent CO2 emissions so that all emissions can be viewed on an equivalent basis. The calculator has built-in macros and formulas that make the conversions and produce various graphs that illustrate changes and trends in emissions over time.
