During discussions with managers about ESG integration, they assess the use of ESG information to generate outperformance.  Four factors are assessed to derive an overall ESG rating: idea generation, portfolio construction, implementation, and firmwide commitment.  The consultant utilizes a 4 point ESG rating scale, these ratings are incorporated into our overall due diligence on new investment funds / managers.
