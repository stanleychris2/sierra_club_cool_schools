The Kapnick Education & Research Center was built as a joint effort between the Naples Botanical Gardens and FGCU.  At present, the Botanical Gardens uses the majority of the facility; FGCU uses minimal lab space for Faculty Research and the Multipurpose Room for occasional presentations.  This building is not included in our institutional boundary since its primary usage does not reflect activities material to the university.  Furthermore, the impact of FGCU used space at Kapnick relative to the overall operational performance of the university is minimal.  

The Vester Marine Lab is owned by the FGCU Foundation and the scale of the property's impact relative to the overall operational performance of the university is minimal.  Therefore, it is not included in our operational data sets.   

The Buckingham Property that FGCU acquired in 2010 is not material to this report at this  point in time.  It was not included in our most recent GHG report, there are no classes or offices on the property, and planning for the property's future use is still underway.

The Atrium in Ft. Myers, the Renaissance Academy in Naples, and the Herald Court Center, in Punta Gorda are leased spaces within commercially owned or public buildings.  These are not included in our operation credits because FGCU does not have control or significant influence over the physical structures.  However, continuing Education classes offered in Naples and Punta Gorda are included in EN-11 because they are an essential part of FGCU's Public Engagement.",--

The University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) has undergone transformations since its founding in 1927 as Edinburg College, a two-year community college governed by the Edinburg School District. Six name changes later, the university took its place on September 1, 1989, as a member of The University of Texas System (UT System). The name Pan American was selected because it reflected the institution’s desire to bridge the cultures of North and South America and to reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the institution.
UTPA is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).  It is the 11th largest university in the state and the 6th largest in the UT System. According to Hispanic Outlook, 2014, UTPA is 5th in the nation in the number of undergraduate and graduate degrees awarded to Hispanics. UTPA offers 54 Bachelor’s degrees, 52 Master’s degrees, 3 doctoral degrees, 1 cooperative doctoral (Pharm. D.) in cooperation with the University of Texas at Austin, and 1 cooperative doctoral (Spanish) in cooperation with the University of Houston. The University has a selective admissions policy.  It primarily serves the southernmost four counties of Texas which are referred to as the Rio Grande Valley.  
Mission Statement: The University of Texas-Pan American serves the social, economic, research and, most importantly, the educational needs of the rapidly growing transnational, culturally diverse population of South Texas. The University creates, preserves, and transmits knowledge that advances the region, state, and nation and that builds prosperity through entrepreneurship and commercialization. In a supportive environment dedicated to student learning, the University provides quality instruction in rigorous academic programs that leads to bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees as well as professional certificates. Through teaching, research, creative activity, and public services, the University prepares students to be socially conscious citizens and transformative leaders.
The Students: UTPA has the fourth largest enrollments of Hispanic students among four-year colleges and universities in the United States. Over 88 percent of the students are Hispanic, reflecting the demographic characteristics of the immediate region, the Rio Grande Valley. Enrollment in fall 2014 was a little over 21,000 students.
