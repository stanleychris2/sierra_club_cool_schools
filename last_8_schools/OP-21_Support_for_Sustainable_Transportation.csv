MORTGAGE PROGRAM
The mortgage aspect of the Faculty Housing Policy is an important buttress to the larger rental program. It encourages tenure-line and Continuing Appointment faculty who find College housing inappropriate for their families and who wish to own their own homes to locate near the College rather than in less expensive but more remote areas. In addition, it permits those who elect to live on campus to consider their choice a voluntary one rather than one imposed by the high cost of homes in the surrounding area. Having faculty members living near the campus permits the College to receive some of the benefits described for on-campus housing. 
Haverford's current policy is to provide to tenure-line and Continuing Appointment faculty and senior administrators who report directly to the President a 20-year mortgage at a rate of 1.5% below Philadelphia market rates or at federal safe harbor rates, whichever is higher; no points are charged. The maximum mortgage is $250,000, if family income is sufficient to cover a mortgage of this size. The mortgage amount can represent up to 90% of the value of a house within four miles of the campus. The College will not provide mortgage support for a house farther than four miles from the campus. Prospective users of this policy must discuss the details with the Vice President for Finance and Administration (extension 1223) before making any commitments. This policy can be amended by the Board of Managers at any time.
Mortgages may be granted to faculty members who are living in College housing and approaching retirement. These mortgages will be for a maximum term of 10 years and for a maximum principal amount 1/2 that of the regular mortgage. All other terms apply (e.g., the house still must be within 4 miles of campus).",True,Abandoned bikes are collected regularly and sent to the Devereux Foundation where mentally challenged individuals are taught to refurbish them.
