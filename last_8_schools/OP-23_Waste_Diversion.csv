","Bucknell University food donation program would be the Lewisburg Community Garden.  A joint project between Bucknell University and the Borough of Lewisburg. The garden features 40 rental plots for groups, families or individuals interested in gardening. This area represents only half of the eighteen thousand square feet the garden occupies. The other half is a community plot. Bucknell student volunteers and interns use this area to grow organic produce that is donated to the community. During the 2013 gardening season the garden cultivated 56 varieties of fruits and vegetables. The garden harvested and donated over 2,500lbs of produce to local hot meal programs and the food bank. This donation represents a savings of about $5,500 that our partners save on food costs. ","Bucknell University Dining prides itself on the service of fresh ’made from scratch’ food. As a result of this we process all vegetables from scratch utilizing the trimmings (onion skins, broccoli stalks, carrot peels etc.) to create all of the stocks we use for soups. Because of full utilization of these and other production castoff products (beef trimmings, chicken bones etc.) and a fiscally responsible production system we produce little to no usable pre-service or post production waste. 
Three of the primary service areas in our dining facility produce food offerings to order, generating no pre or post-consumer waste. Our primary facility/dining room is open 18 hours a day, 7 days a week. This and our full embrace of batch cooking allow full utilization of food produced.
We operate on an extremely small margin of profitability so serving safe, healthy and fiscally responsible food is our driver. Overproducing and disposing of product is simply unacceptable.  
","The primary waste produced in our facility is post-consumer waste. We utilize a pulper system which grinds all food plate waste (along with napkins) into a biomass perfect for anaerobic digestion. Before we went tray less we estimate more than 600 # day of this waste was produced and sent to a land fill.
After going tray less we saw a reduction to less than 200 #’s a day of this waste. After finding a suitable partner for composting we were able to compost 13 tons of waste in about 35 weeks of service. Unfortunately the relationship we had with a local farm that was able to utilize this compost ended. We are presently looking at options to continue composting with another partner.
In the fall of 2012 Bucknell hosted author Jonathan Bloom, whose literary focus is the reduction of food waste. After four  educational opportunities (Waste Weighs with guests in our facility’s tray waste being weighed) over the last 2 years we noted a reduction of the 1.5 oz a plate waste a meal we had measured. 
Through a series of student driven classes and informational signage Dining partnered with Bucknell Facilities to raise awareness and reduce food waste.

Weights for material reused, donated, or re-sold (i.e. processed through OSU Surplus Property) are not taken upon transfer, but we made a conservative estimate of the material processed and included it in the figure above. This means that the amount of total waste diverted is higher than represented above. 

Our surplus program is well-established in our state, and we sell used items to departments, agencies, non-profits and the general public (at our once weekly public sales). This accounts for a substantial amount of materials diverted from the landfill - in FY15 the sales volume of surplus items was approximately $1 million. Surplus also disassembles and recycles products that cannot be resold, landfilling only the items that are neither resellable nor recyclable.

RECYCLING PROGRAM
As stated on our website, ""Campus Recycling is responsible for managing a comprehensive waste management system that focuses on reducing, reusing and recycling with disposal as a last resort."" In addition to collecting recyclables from all campus buildings, Campus Recycling offers many additional recycling and waste reduction programs:

1) With Surplus Property, we co-sponsor an annual donation drive in the residence halls during move-out week. In June 2015 we collected 33,950 pounds of material for donation and resale (http://fa.oregonstate.edu/recycling/events-and-opportunities/res-hall-move-out-donation-drive).

2) Campus Recycling provides event recycling for campus events (free to most departments), and serves as a resource to event organizers who seek to plan sustainable events.

3) OSU has fairly extensive food composting programs as described below.

4) In addition to composting food and dining waste, OSU also collects the following for composting: landscape debris, scrap wood, and animal bedding.

5) Outreach efforts by Campus Recycling are extensive:

Campus Recycling employs one full-time staff and two part-time student staff to work on outreach and the development of new programs. Outreach for recycling and composting occurs via educational events (RecycleMania, Earth Week, etc.), tabling at events, public presentations and workshops, collaborative partnerships, social media, etc. 

We are the primary organizer of the annual Earth Week celebration, which brings together 40+ on- and off-campus environmental organizations to offer a week full of educational and engaging events, including a community fair and many others.

We started the All-in-the-Hall program in order to increase recycling by providing an equal opportunity to recycle and landfill waste in classroom buildings. Halls included in the program have trash bins removed from classrooms, which are replaced by multi-bin units that also offer recycling located in the hallway. Campus Recycling requires that all new and renovated buildings be included in this program.

Campus Recycling and the Student Sustainability Initiative coordinate a student volunteer team called the Waste Watchers, which works on events and marketing, and provides leadership opportunities for students.

During the FY15 performance year, the Waste Watchers headed up the Coffee Cup Coup Campaign, an initiative whose primary goal was to reduce the amount of disposable coffee cups being used, while promoting reusable alternatives. The campaign focused on socially normalizing reusable mugs by equipping and rewarding individuals who used them.

Campus Recycling partners with Republic Services to coordinate a Master Recycler program for Linn and Benton counties in Oregon. This 8-week course educates community members about all aspects of waste reduction and is offered for free to anyone who volunteers for 30 hours after completion of the course. These Master Recyclers volunteer at OSU and in the community to educate others about waste reduction.","OSU Housing and Dining Services provides all leftover products to Linn-Benton Food Share.  In addition, OSU provides a Food Pantry for students in need.  Any tips left in OSU coffee shops are donated to the food pantry.","Republic Services of Corvallis had the first facility in Oregon's to be permitted to accept all food waste including meat, bread and vegetable products. This facility is called the Pacific Region Compost Facility (PRC) and it handles the large majority of compost for the OSU campus. The facility is about 10 miles from OSU, reducing transportation costs and fuel use. A few smaller, on-site composting sites also exist on the OSU campus. Here are the programs to collect pre-consumer organic waste:

1) Pre-consumer food waste is composted at the three dining centers of OSU Housing and Dining Services and one Memorial Union restaurant (Pangea). The 3 dining centers and Memorial Union (from Joe's Burgers and Panda Express) recycle used cooking oil and grease. All campus coffee shops collect used grounds. This pre-consumption waste is sent to the PRC.

2) OSU offers a Department Compost program for kitchens and break rooms. The material collected is a mix of pre- and post-consumer organic material and it is sent to the PRC for processing. Some of the departments are set-up with worm compost bins to manage their own waste, if requested. 

3) In FY15 OSU ran a res. hall compost program, offering compost to residents in 3 res. halls. The material collected is a mix of pre- and post-consumer organic material and it is sent to the PRC for processing.

4) The Student Sustainability Initiative provides a 3-bin composting system at the Student Sustainability Center, where Center staff compost. Also, people can donate kitchen waste from residence halls or off-campus living to be composted and used on-site in the permaculture garden.  

5) A compost system located near Wiegand Hall collects food scraps and coffee grounds and is utilized as a teaching tool for soils classes.

Note: Most dining facilities not only sort and collect curbside recycling and compostable material, but also recycle used cooking oil, cooking grease, and film plastic.","OSU's post-consumer food composting is similar to our pre-consumer programs listed above. 

1) Post-consumer food waste is composted at all three of the dining centers of OSU Housing and Dining Services (2 of these 3 centers have trained staff sorting in the kitchen, resulting in a very high recovery rate). This waste is sent to the Pacific Region Compost facility (PRC).

2) Post-consumer food waste is now being composted at one of the Memorial Union restaurants - the North Porch Cafe.

3) OSU offers a Department Compost program for kitchens and break rooms. The material collected is a mix of pre- and post-consumer organic material and it is sent to the PRC for processing. Some of the departments are set-up with worm compost bins to manage their own waste, if requested.

To estimate this weight, we queried our sales database to pull a list of items sold in the performance year, determined the quantity of the most common items sold (e.g. desks, computers, etc.), and multiplied that by an average weight of said items. There were many categories of items we did not account for, so the resulting number is less than what we expect is the actual total of material reused by being processed through OSU Surplus Property.

We have done this with the help of new MOLOKs on campus, which separate waste into recycling, organics, cardboard, and garbage.

The Departmental Central Waste Program has also significantly helped Laurier achieve over 60% waste diversion in response to mandates from the Ministry of Environment. This program removes desk-side waste bins in place of a central waste centre with full-scale recycling and composting capabilities. Employees and faculty are responsible for separating and disposing their waste in the centres. The centres are all located within a reasonable distance of employees within offices to ensure accessibility and are made out of recycled plastic and are manufactured locally. 

Waste education campaigns have been run in residence for the past two years by the Sustainability Council. Their aim is to educate first year students on proper waste management practices in order to help reduce waste contamination in residence buildings. Proper signage has also been added to all indoor main collection bins in residence to further help students properly sort their waste.
