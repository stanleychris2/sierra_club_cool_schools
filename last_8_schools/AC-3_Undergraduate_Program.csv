An interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts major in Environmental Studies is offered for the student with an abiding interest in the general environmental problems faced by humans, and with special concern for their humanistic, policy, and social sciences aspects. The B.A. in Environmental Studies is a strong, broad, liberal arts degree. It also is a preparation for one of the growing numbers of environmental careers in planning, business, non-profits, law, administration, or education.The B.A. in Environmental Science is only available as a second major to students who major in biology, chemistry, or geology and therefore may be thought of as a means of adding an environmental concentration to a B.A. science degree. These three disciplines form the core of Environmental Science, and consequently the first major ensures that students have sufficient depth of knowledge in a particular area of Environmental Science. Complementing the depth a student receives from the biology, chemistry, or geology major, the B.A. in Environmental Science provides breadth across the interdisciplinary field of Environmental Science.

This upper division undergraduate program is designed to mesh both with community college associate degrees and the General Education Program at FGCU. In the junior and senior years, students will develop a core set of skills in case management, information and referral, and community organization which can be utilized in a variety of practice settings. Graduates are prepared for advanced study if they want to pursue a graduate degree. Those choosing to enter a MSW program must do so within 5 years after completion of the BSW in order to receive advance standing.

Local Partnerships: The Division of Social Work participates in the College of Professional Studies partnerships throughout the state. The Center for Public Policy collaborates with many area organizations. The internships in local agencies are supervised by social work professionals. 

International Partnerships: The Division of Social Work has established a relationship with the University of the Applied Sciences, Bochum, Germany, and the University of Guyana, S.A. 

Distance Learning: About 30 percent of the coursework for the BSW program is currently available via distance learning; our goal is to have 60 percent online. Additional courses are added each year. See the college academic advisor for information.

The 3BL approach emphasizes the importance of people and the planet as well as profit as important performance metrics that successful businesses must recognize. Managers following 3BL metrics recognize the stakeholder approach to decision making rather than the traditional shareholder approach.
