To begin, a group of faculty members and the Sustainability Coordinator crafted a definition of sustainability as it pertains to academic research at FGCU.   The following definition was agreed upon and is in line with the Earth Charter's definition: ""Research that address distributing social, economic, and environmental resources in ways that make them equitably available for humans, other organisms, and future generations. These teaching activities are universal and any discipline could participate.""  This definition and a copy of the AASHE STARS definitions of ""a sustainability course"" and ""a course that includes sustainability"" from the Standards and Terms section of the 2.0 Technical Manual were distributed to any person identifying courses for this inventory for guidance.  

To identify undergraduate courses, Undergraduate Academic Advisors worked with Deans and Associate Deans in their colleges to identify courses from the Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 terms that would qualify.

Graduate courses for the Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 terms were identified as a joint effort between the following: The Dean of Graduate Studies, Academic Department Chairs, Graduate Program Leaders, Academic Advisors and the Environmental Heath & Safety Office.

FY14 and FY15 report the same data due to staff limitations and data availability limitations and importantly, a recalibration of sustainability course assessment with the faculty. It was anticipated some updated data would be available for FY15, but the faculty process did not conclude until FY16.  It is anticipated that the FY16 process will use a centralized reporting method that prompts instructors making any changes to curriculum in the new curriculum proposal system to be asked if the course may contain sustainability.  This ""checkbox"" prompt will result in a data set that can be analyzed in real time by the Sustainability Office.  This is anticipated to start in spring 2016. 

For the original FY13 process, once the committee of faculty developed OSU's framework for evaluating sustainability course content, the following process was used to identify and categorize the courses:
 
Stage 1: Utilize curriculum proposal system to identify all new course for FY13
Stage 2: Evaluate course title	
Stage 3: Evaluate course description	
Stage 4: Evaluate syllabus
Stage 5: Complete form	
Stage 6: Separate sustainability courses from courses with sustainability content
