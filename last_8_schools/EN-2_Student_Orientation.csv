Oregon State University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:54:12,brandon.trelstad@oregonstate.edu,2.0,Pursuing,100.0,"New student orientation at OSU includes three programs that include sustainability-related content.  START is a summer two day event preparing new students and their parents for the upcoming year. CONNECT is held the week preceding fall term. U-Engage which is a first quarter class for freshman that meets weekly.

During START sessions all food is composted and served using compostable serving ware, and is marketed to new students as a zero waste event.  Sustainability groups and resources are prominently displayed for students to learn how to get involved.  Sustainability group display tables are staffed to welcome new students. 

CONNECT starts with campus move-in where volunteers are on hand to show new residents how to recycle and where additional campus resources exist. It is a crash course for students to learn how recycling, composting, and waste reduction works at OSU.  The annual Sustainability Fair is a key event during CONNECT, as is the zero waste New Student Picnic where thousands of students gather and more information is available at staffed sustainability tables and booths. CONNECT also features a Day of Caring where students participate in community service opportunities on campus and throughout the city of Corvallis.

U-Engage focuses on how new students can get involved on campus and how when they leave OSU they can be more productive members of the community. Trips to the Student Sustainability Center are included in U-Engage as is education about how student government works and how students can advocate for themselves and others.

Additionally, now that OSU has a first year live on requirement, more students are actively engaged in orientation programming. ",http://oregonstate.edu/newstudents/home/,--

Slippery Rock University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 17:00:25,paul.scanlon@sru.edu,2.0,Pursuing,100.0,"Slippery Rock welcomes both new and returning students with two weeks of ""WOW"" (Weekends of Welcome) activities and informational sessions, including sustainability-focused activities. A flyer insert describing SRU's sustainability programs and resources is provided in the ""Successful Learning: A Guide to First Year Studies (FYRST)"" handbook provided to all incoming freshman, and includes information about:
- SRU sustainability programs; our climate commitment, and the Office of Sustainability vision and mission statements;
- sustainable internship opportunities and clubs;
- links to other online sustainability resources
     - sustainability website (www.sru.edu/sustainability)
     - sustainability facebook page (Sustainability@sru.edu), and 
     - sustainability Twitter feed (@SRUsustain).

Sustainability is also promoted through WOW events by encouraging students to participate in the campus-wide Energy Pledge Campaign, Recycling and Waste Prevention Programs, and the Green Bike Initiative Program among others. 

Residence Hall Community Advisors are also educated about Slippery Rock's Office of Sustainability and our Climate Action Plan progress, and encouraged to share energy conservation/sustainability information and upcoming events at residence hall floor meetings. The Office of Sustainability also provides a ""Sustainability 101"" presentation to all new incoming student interns at the Sustainability Enterprise Accelerator, and a university map featuring sustainable campus features and trails is made available online as a downloadable PDF.

Wilfrid Laurier University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 17:07:49,cbennett@wlu.ca,2.0,Pursuing,100.0,"The following activities and efforts amount to prominent inclusion of sustainability in new student orientation at Laurier:

-When first year students arrive on their first day of orientation week, they are provided with an ""O-week bag"". One of the items located in this bag is a USB key, on which the Sustainability Map, Green Guide for Living, and information about how to become involved in the Sustainability Council (a first year leadership program focused on promoting sustainability amongst first year student) are all preloaded. This gives new students information on sustainable services, events, projects and facilities from the beginning of their Laurier career.

-Also included in the bag is a reusable water bottle. Throughout orientation week, multiple water filling stations are provided for students to fill up their bottles in order to stay hydrated, and reduce the amount of plastic water bottles used. Five large banners are produced and put on display in the main gathering locations throughout the week, which feature a map of campus indicating all the water filling station locations, bike racks, and compost/recycling/garbage facilities. New students are encouraged by their O-Week leaders to use these resources and the Ecohawks help expand on the benefits of sustainable practices during meal times. 

-The Ecohawks play a crucial role in waste management over orientation week as they bring compost, recycling, and garbage bins to each of the four meal locations and ensure that every piece of waste is put into the proper receptacle. All meals contain extremely limited amounts of non-compostables or non-recyclables, and for approximately 5000 first year students, each meal produces no more than 4 garbage bags. Before each meal time, new students are addressed by the Ecohawks, who engage them in waste education reinforcing the importance of proper waste management practices.

-One of the main events during orientation week is the 'Get Involved Fair' which features campus clubs, services and organizations. Each year the Sustainability Office, Sustainability Council and Ecohawks have a presence where they have the opportunity to promote volunteer opportunities, projects, sustainability highlights, and a chance for incoming students to interact face to face with the staff and volunteers who run these organizations. Students can ask questions, discuss projects directly and express their concerns or ideas.   

-First year students are divided into groups, and guided throughout the week by an upper year student leader. These student leaders are provided with a manual containing useful information which they carry around with them for the week. Among many things, the manual includes information on the role of the Sustainability Office and Ecohawks, as well as recycling and composting guidelines and waste disposal and water filling station locations. This is to ensure that student leaders have easy access to this information to answer any questions from the incoming students.
