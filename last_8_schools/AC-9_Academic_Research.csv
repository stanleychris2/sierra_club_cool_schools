Florida Gulf Coast University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:31:56,kleone@fgcu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,70.0,132.0,22.0,25.0,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/39/6/470/2678/AC-9-Academic%20Research%20Inventory-FINAL_1.xlsx,,"To inventory the amount of faculty members and departments engaged with or conducting sustainability research, we used a non-probability, purposive sampling method.  We sampled research from the following places:
1)	Research funded by The Center for Sustainability & Education (CESE) during the 2013-14 fiscal year.  
2)	Research funded by The Office of Research & Sponsored Programs during the 2013-14 fiscal year.*  
3)	Research funded by The Whitaker Center for STEM Education [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics] during the 2013-14 fiscal year.  
4)	Research presented at the Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium on December 6th, 2013.
5)	Research presented at Campus Research Day on Friday, April 18, 2014**

Before sampling the research, a group of faculty members and the Sustainability Coordinator crafted a definition of sustainability as it pertains to academic research at FGCU.   The following definition was agreed upon and is in line with the Earth Charter's definition: ""Research that address distributing social, economic, and environmental resources in ways that make them equitably available for humans, other organisms, and future generations.""  This definition along with the Earth Charter's Values and Principles for a Sustainable future guided the faculty and staff members responsible for identifying sustainability research for this inventory.  

The Center for Sustainability & Education and The Office of Research & Sponsored Programs identified sustainability related research funded through their offices.  The Whitaker Center for STEM Education [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics] identified sustainability research funded by their Mini-Grants and Travel Grants.  The Office of Environmental Health & Safety pulled appropriate research from the list of research presented at the Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium and Campus Research Day.  Duplicates were eliminated to avoid double counting when calculating the amount of faculty members engaged with or conducting sustainability research out of the total amount of faculty engaging with or conducting any type of research. (i.e. Faculty members engaged with or conducting multiple research projects were only counted once).    
The research inventoried from the five aforementioned sources enabled us to report on the total number of faculty engaged in sustainability research and the total number of departments with a faculty member conducting sustainability research.  We reported on the on the number of departments with one or more faculty/staff member conducting sustainability research by looking at funded research (sampled in sources one through three listed above).  We reported on the amount of faculty/staff engaged with sustainability by looking at all five places inventoried.  

Out of FGCU’s 488 faculty, 132 received funding through CESE, The Office of Research & Sponsored Programs, The Whitaker Center or advised students participating in Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium or Research Day.  70 out of the 132 were engaged with sustainability related research projects.  

We defined the 28 total academic divisions (listed in the notes) in IC-3 and AC-1 of this STARS report.  The Counseling, Accounting, and Resort & Hospitality Management departments did apply for research funding or have faculty members participate in the Research Day or Symposium that we used to sample research for this credit.  Therefore, we are reporting that 25 of the academic departments are conducting research for the purposes of this credit.  Of those 25 departments, 22 had at least faculty member that received funds through CESE, The Office of Research & Sponsored Programs, or The Whitaker Center to conduct sustainability research. Please see the attached inventory for further details. ",,--,"*The four staff members that applied for programming grants through the Office of Research & Sponsored Programs were removed from this sample.  All remaining people inventoried were faculty.  

**Only the Faculty Member that gave the student a grade for the project and submitted the Research Day proposal on students’ behalf is listed on our inventory.  In many instances, additional faculty advisors were involved with the research inventoried on the “Research Day” sheet of the attached Excel inventory.  Unfortunately, there was no record of these additional faculty members available for this inventory.  

In instances where staff or faculty members were engaged with sustainability research on behalf of an office, center, or non-academic department, they were categorized within the most applicable academic department. (i.e. the academic department in which that faculty or staff member could teach a course relating to their research).  The center, office, or non-academic department is noted in parenthesis on the inventory in the “Department Affiliation” column for reference.  "

Correlation with OSU's Signature Areas of Distinction was also supported by this method. As indicated in OSU’s Strategic Plan, research activities should advance the science of sustainable earth ecosystems, improve human health and wellness, promote economic development and social progress, or expand the current knowledge base within sustainability focus areas such as alternative energy, climate, and materials sciences.","Harnessing the Power of the Ocean
In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy established the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC), directed by OSU mechanical engineering professor Bob Paasch, a collaborative effort between OSU, University of Washington and the National Renewable Energy Lab. The NNMREC includes researchers from the colleges of Engineering, Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences and Science, along with Oregon Sea Grant, the Cooperative Institute for Marine Resources Studies, the Marine Mammal Institute and the Hatfield Marine Science Center.  NNMREC is one of only three U.S. Department of Energy National Marine Renewable Energy Centers.

Wind Energy: Thinking Smaller and Thinking Ahead
OSU's Energy Resources Research Laboratory is working with the Bonneville Power Administration on wind-forecasting models to determine the most productive locations for wind farms. Forecasting models are also useful in research to capture excess energy generated during peak wind events and releasing the stored energy onto the power grid at times when wind speeds are slow. OSU research also focuses on grid management and integration of renewable energy sources.

Modernizing the grid
Beyond finding new sources of energy and reducing consumption, OSU energy research also addresses the need to modernizing America’s aging and outdated power distribution infrastructure. This includes scale modeling, control systems, machine learning and networks that support smart grids. These digitally-controlled transmission and distribution systems are designed to be more reliable, energy efficient and economical, as well as able to readily accommodate renewable energy sources. OSU has one of the only grid-scale laboratories capable of testing products for utility performance.

Making Solar More Efficient and Manufacturable 
Materials research is at the core of transforming solar energy technology. Appropriate selection of materials enables new technologies that are inexpensive, highly efficient and reliable. Oregon State University conducts a variety of materials research leading to next generation technologies.  Advancements include thin film flexible substrate solar technologies, high efficiency coatings and transparent electronics to optimize solar energy harvest. In partnering with companies like Oregon BEST and Solar World  OSU research in solar technologies is expanding at an exciting pace.

	Forcespinning™, a process of creating nanofibers, is a technology created by Dr. Karen Lozano and Dr. Kamalaksha Sarkar, both faculty members in UTPA’s College of Engineering and Computer Science.  In this process, fibers spin at the nano level, increasing its strength and efficiency. Forcespinning is significant for sustainability in that the technology can be used in many manufacturing applications including medical and filtration materials, textiles, personal care products including diapers and cosmetics, insulation, and energy storage, making these products more cost effective. UTPA's first regional technology start-up company FibeRio, has manufactured the machines using Forcespinning™ technology to produce nanofibers in greater quantities and materials at a lower cost.  This technology is an example of how effectively transferring and leveraging the knowledge and expertise from UTPA can enhance sustainable economic development in the region.



Coastal Studies Lab
	The University of Texas-Pan American Coastal Studies Laboratory is part of the UTPA campus and studies and exhibits marine life such as crustaceans, marine vertebrates and plant life.  There are several aquariums and touch tables.  This lab is located on South Padre Island, Texas within easy reach of a variety of marine, estuarine and terrestrial habits.  Programs at the laboratory focus on understanding the interrelationships that govern the structure and functioning of inshore coastal ecosystems and impact of human activities on coastal resources.  Research focuses on the coastal ecosystems of southern Texas and northern Mexico.  
CSL researchers are conducting a hydrographic survey at critical locations in the Laguna Madre to predict where an oil or chemical spill would travel if it entered the Laguna Madre through the Brazos Santiago Pass from the Gulf of Mexico.  
The Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network, founded in 1980, is a nonprofit volunteer-based organization dedicated to the understanding and conservation of marine mammals. The Network rescues and rehabilitates marine mammals that strand along the Texas Coast, providing food, medical treatment and 24-hour-a-day observation. Network volunteers in six regions along the coast respond immediately when a stranding is reported.  
The UTPA Coastal Studies Laboratory is an active member of the South Padre Island Sea Turtle Salvage and Stranding Network. The Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network (STSSN) was formally established in 1980 to collect information on and document strandings of marine turtles along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The network encompasses the coastal areas of the eighteen state region from Maine through Texas, and includes portions of the U.S. Caribbean. Data are compiled through the efforts of network participants who document marine turtle strandings in their respective areas and contribute those data to the centralized STSSN data base.
Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) is an environmental education program that promotes locally relevant, experiential learning in the K-12 environment. The B-WET program aims to promote environmental literacy in society, supporting individuals to understand, protect and restore watersheds and related ocean and coastal ecosystems. NOAA recognizes that knowledge and commitment built from firsthand experience, especially in the context of one's community and culture, is essential for achieving environmental stewardship.
Carefully selected experiences driven by rigorous academic learning standards, engendering discovery and wonder, and nurturing a sense of community will further connect students with their watershed, help reinforce an ethic of responsible citizenship, and promote academic achievement. B-WET maintains relevance by responding to regional education and environmental priorities through local implementation
Dr. Thomas Whelan is the Coordinator for the American Chemical Society-National Chemistry Olympiad for the South Texas Division. He serves as the Chair of Freshwater and Marine section of the Texas Academy of Science and is an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of Texas Pan American. As director of the UTPA Coastal Studies Lab, his current research includes investigating the chemical interaction between seagrasses and coastal sediments in the Lower Laguna Madre. The results of his study will help determine highest possible toxicity levels for this unique and environmentally valuable salt water estuary.

UTPA Center for Subtropical Studies
	The Center for Subtropical Studies is a multidisciplinary research component of the College of Science and Mathematics at The University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA).  The Center for Subtropical Studies supports the research, education, and community service missions of the university by: focusing on the environmental concerns of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, providing infrastructure and a forum for discussions of, collaboration in, and implementation of research and educational programs and initiatives involving UTPA and non-UTPA entities, enhancing institutional effectiveness by fostering organized interaction with area civic, business, and political leaders and with regional, national and international organizations with an interest in subtropical studies or the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and providing opportunities for students in the natural sciences through an organized framework of research excellence.
http://faculty.utpa.edu/orgs/css/

Faculty and staff submitted 224 proposals seeking $126.7million dollars and this resulted in 141 awards for $23.3 million dollars during FY 2014. This activity in combination with teaching efforts by our faculty is an indicator that our faculty want to not only advance the knowledge in their respective disciplines but they also want to create opportunities for our students to be engaged in hands-on experience. 

Dr. John Lowdermilk, the chair of the College of Education’s Department of Educational Psychology, and the former Director of UTPA’s Education Technology Resource Center, won a $50,000 grant from the Sid W. Richardson Foundation of Ft. Worth, Texas.  Dr. Lowdermilk wrote an iPad app which demonstrates how it might feel for a special education student with a visual impairment, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a low level autism, or dyslexia who has been assigned to a mainstream classroom.  Apple has accepted the app in the iOS App store, and is being distributed by the newly-formed business, L. Lowdermilk Industries.

Dr. Marie Mora won the National Science Foundation award for over $492,000 and became the national director of the Economics Mentoring Program. Working with other universities such as the University of Chicago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado and the University of New Mexico, Dr. Mora will match up experienced economists, most of whom are members of the American Economic Association and/or the black minority-oriented National Economic Association, with minority doctoral students across the country.
 
Dr. Yuanbing Mao is a chemist developing small man-packed devices intended to detect low level radiation which might be a threat to American soldiers on the battlefield. With a four-year grant from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Dr. Mao has been able to hire Dr. Madhab Pokhrel and Dr. Bhupendra Srivastava, both post-doctoral fellows, to work on the project, as well as two graduate students, one of whom has published two papers on the research. While the over-arching goal of the research is to develop a small device that can detect low levels of radiation that might harm American soldiers, the wider results will build the body of knowledge about luminescent core-shell nanostructures.

Dr. James Bullard is another chemistry faculty member engaged in biomedical research. Over the years, he’s brought in many grants, including the current one from the U. S. Department of Health & Human Graduate student Lawrence Cano at work on UTPA’s X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer Services and the National Institutes of Health. The four year funding totals $430,800 to examine ""A Protein Synthesis from Pseudomones aeruginosa for Screening Antibacterials.” Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common disease-causing bacterium, and Bullard’s goal is to identify compounds that are potential drug candidates intended to fight bacteria that have become increasingly resistant to the usual treatments and to reduce the side effects of those treatments. His work is important in two ways: first to find other ways to combat hospital-borne bacteria that have become drug resistant, and second, to help with basic research in combatting bioterrorism. Dr. Bullard’s other grants include one from the prestigious Robert A. Welch Foundation, which funds research by chemists. His work has direct local impact, such as a grant from the South Texas Border Health Disparities Center for ""Development of a Minimum Bacterial Protein Synthesis System for Discovery of New Antibiotics Beneficial to South Texas Inhabitants."" Bullard is also organizing his research to include students. At present, he has two graduate students, six undergraduate students and one Master’s level assistant scientist. “It’s our hope that eventually, we will be able to bring new anti-bacterial compounds to market through a new company that will provide jobs and expand the economy of the Valley” says Bullard. “We also want to create an environment of student research.
