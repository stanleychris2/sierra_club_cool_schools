GIS Mapping With The Community In Mind 
 
Benjamin J. Dion and Eric D. Frankovitch 
Florida Gulf Coast University, College of Arts and Sciences, Environmental Studies 
Abstract: The utilization of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and Geographic Information System (GIS) software have enabled us to develop a virtual interactive map of many important natural areas in Southwest Florida, such as the Imperial River, the nature trails at Barefoot Beach Preserve, and the Caracara Prairie Preserve nature trails at Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed (CREW). The interactive virtual map of the watershed can be accessed and utilized by students, instructors, and the local Southwest Florida community to enhance environmental education and outreach. The main goal of the project is to create new innovative tools that can help students and the community understand the benefits from and human impact on the natural goods and services that our healthy ecosystems provide. Our project also sets the foundation for a variety of future student service learning projects, which can be embedded into the map adding to the maps’ educational qualities.

The Imperial River and the nature trails at Barefoot Beach 
Preserve were mapped out with GPS devices and added to the GIS 
map as separate Civic Engagement Projects in our Spring 2012 
Environmental Biology of Southwest Florida class with Professor 
David Green. Ben worked with two students mapping out the nature 
trails at Barefoot Beach, while Eric was in one of the three groups of 
students that mapped out portions of the Imperial River. These 
projects were the first two GIS mapping experiences that we had 
had, and led us to join David Green’s Straw Hat Brigade and working 
together during the summer, fall, and spring 2012-2013 semesters

The Caracara Prairie Preserve Nature Trails at CREW became our 
next large project during the 2012-2013 summer, fall, and spring 
semesters. During Summer 2012, Eric and his group from Professor 
David Green’s Introduction to Environmental Studies class mapped 
out a portion of CREW’s Caracara Prairie Preserve Nature Trails. In 
Fall 2012, Ben facilitated students of Professor David Green’s 
Environmental Biology of Southwest Florida class in mapping out 
another portion of the Caracara Trails. In Spring 2013, as the leading 
students in the Straw Hat Brigade, we mapped out the last 
remaining portions of the Caracara trail system, including all “Kissing 
Gates”, “You Are Here” maps, and important locations and features. 
After uploading our data into Professor Green’s interactive map, we 
added the extra components and data points, such as the exact 
locations of all 9 “Kissing Gates” and pictures.

Students also use the garden as a learning tool in courses such as GG101, in this course students are introduced to human geography. Topics include population and development, cartography and GIS, economic geography, cultural geography and political geography. In laboratory exercises, students learn methods and techniques used by geographers. Students utilize the garden by participating in intercultural training which provides increased awareness and understanding of Aboriginal cultures, knowledge and worldviews.

The other learning course that utilizes the garden is PS332: Environment, Psychology and Action. In this course students have the opportunity to develop energy action plans based on areas within sustainability. The culminating learning activity of the course is the action project. These projects give students the opportunity to learn in an applied way and also make a contribution in the real world. Students have the opportunity to choose the garden as one of their action projects and develop programs and action plans for the space.
