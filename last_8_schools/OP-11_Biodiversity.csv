Bucknell University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:29:23,delmogaz@bucknell.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"There is nothing in the campus master plan that formally designates an area as preserved, though lawn below the main quad and the grove are understood to be “sacred space”. The plan does recognize the importance of open space and the overall rural character of the campus to Bucknell’s character and states an intention to remain true to the Larson vision, with its emphasis on open space. However, there is an area specifically designated for preservation known as the Chillisquaque Natural Area and a property in Cowan. ",--,True,"Currently, there is no systematic attention to native vs. exotic species. The greening literature places a great deal of emphasis on native species; however there are good reasons to include some exotic species in campus plantings. We discuss this issue in the “Biodiversity” section below.Similarly there is no systematic effort to identify, replace, or eradicate invasive exotic species on campus, though there have been efforts directed at removing multiflora rose. 137 (Rosa multiflora) from the Bucknell Natural Area as well as the occasional removal of Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) where they have become problematic.

","small mammals (e.g. groundhogs, skunk, opossum, and chipmunks) are commonly on campus and the golf course, particularly at night and in the early morning, as are deer. Birds and bats are also abundant, suggesting that insect prey populations are healthy, and sightings of predators such as foxes and hawks indicate that they function as habitat for wildlife. All the mature trees have been identified and catalogued through the arboretum project. Research has been conducted on the biodiversity of the Miller Run, a small stream running through campus, by faculty and students. ","The 2009 environmental assessment recommended the following: 

Protect open space and use the farm development to expand the amount of natural area.
Restore Miller Run
Establish a Bucknell Arboretum
Improve conditions for wildlife
Support the locals and create small natural areas
 Begin the process of increasing tree species diversity

CAMPUS MASTER PLANNING:
FGCU’s campus consists of 800 acres of land, with a central academic core area of approximately 150 acres, bounded by a perimeter road. A lakefront parcel to the northeast of the academic core, called North Lake Village, is devoted to mixed uses, including student housing, athletics and recreation, and specialized academic support facilities. An additional approximately 67 acres of developable upland area exist on campus, including approximately 36 acres within the academic core, and approximately 74 31 acres in two outparcels located to the south and west of the academic core. These outparcels are called South Village Housing, and the Welcome Center Area in this planning document. All of these areas are surrounded by approximately 400 acres of jurisdictional wetland upland buffers.

Pursuant to the adopted 1995 Master Plan, these natural habitat areas are being restored and preserved as development mitigation areas and/or permanent open space. Associated permits and phasing of mitigation activities are described in further detail in Element 13.0 of the 2010-2020 Campus Master Plan Update (http://www.fgcu.edu/Facilities/Files/20120417DIA.pdf). 

CAMPUS ECOSYSTEM MODEL (CEM):
Florida Gulf Coast University has developed a model for undergraduate education whereby the university campus serves as a focus for the study of the entire watershed within which it is situated, from its freshwater origins downstream to the Gulf of Mexico.
•	draws attention to the exchange of information between organisms and their environment
•	tracks matter and energy through the campus ecosystem 
•	explores the linkages that exist between the campus and other ecosystems via the import and export of the above properties.

The model builds upon previously developed and tested teaching practices that connect the learner directly to an ecosystem. These methods include bringing ecology into the classroom through the use of microcosms and using the schoolyard as an extension of the science classroom. The CEM increases the scale and significance of this approach by emphasizing that the university itself is situated within an ecosystem and is both influenced by and influences this system.

Faculty members regularly complete research and class and projects that assess and monitor endangered/vulnerable species and environmentally sensitive areas:

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE (ESC):
The ESC consists of faculty, staff, student, and community members appointed by the University President. The mission of the ESC is to foster proactive environmentally sustainable policies consistent with the University’s mission, guiding principles, and student learning goals and outcomes. The Environmental Sustainability Council meets regularly and is responsible for ensuring that the university has a goal (with associated action plans) for promoting environmental sustainability that is included in the university strategic plan. The action plans will have clear objectives and identified resources and offices responsible for their attainment. The committee will monitor the implementation of approved action plans on an ongoing basis and it will make its recommendations to and receive directions from the Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC). The committee will also ensure coordination of the activities of all campus units engaged in activities designed to achieve environmental sustainability.

13.0 CONSERVATION ELEMENT 
13.1 Background
In 1991, the Florida State Legislature commissioned the Development of the tenth university of the Florida State University System. On October 22, 1992, an agreement was entered into between Alico, Inc., and the Board of Regents of the State of Florida for the conveyance of 760 acres of property owned by Alico to the Board of Regents, for the purpose of constructing Florida Gulf Coast University. The site chosen is located east of Interstate 75 and north of Corkscrew Road, in Sections 13, 14, 23, and 24, Township 46 South, Range 25 East, Lee County, Florida.

As part of the site selection and campus planning processes for the FGCU campus, an extensive ecological inventory was conducted and documented in the 1995 Campus Master Plan Inventory report. Preliminary surveys included a general delineation and characterization of the site’s major upland and wetland plant communities, a general review of the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) soils survey, and a survey for threatened and endangered plant and wildlife species. The goal of this work effort was to provide the ecological information necessary to plan and design the university in the most efficient, ecologically friendly manner. Unavoidably, however, the construction of the campus and its associated infrastructure would impact a variety of upland and wetland systems occurring onsite. In order to compensate for these impacts, a comprehensive mitigation plan was developed and is being rigorously implemented through permits issued by both the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) and the South Florida Water Management 

District (SFWMD). Policies contained in the 1995 Campus Master plan reflect the mitigation plan’s response to such impacts. The following summarizes the findings of the ecological inventory updated on April 17, 2012: 

Soils 
The presence of hydric soils is one of the general parameters that agencies use when making jurisdictional wetland determinations. Therefore, a review of the soils was a necessary part of the jurisdictional process. A The soil survey was utilized as part of the extensive environmental studies undertaken for the jurisdictional process and planning of the FGCU campus. The majority of soil types occurring within the University site were identified as to be hydric (nine out of fourteen), and are distributed mainly in the northwest, south and northeast portions of the site, delineating the boundaries of future development areas. The results of the soil survey are presented below, with a brief description of each soil type and the vegetative cover or land use that generally occurs on each of them. 
•	6-Hallandale fine sand-This is nearly level, poorly drained soil on low, broad flatwoods areas. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is less than 10 inches below the surface for 1 to 3 months. It recedes below the limestone for about 7 months. Florida Land Use, Cover and Forms Classification System (FLUCFCS) units occurring on the soil type include disturbed pine flatwoods (4119), disturbed palmetto prairie (3219), and hydric melaleuca (4241). The soil has severe limitations for urban uses because of shallowness to bedrock and wetness. 
•	13-Boca fine sand-This is a nearly level, poorly drained soil on flatwoods. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is within 10 inches of the surface for 2 to 4 months. It recedes below the limestone for about 6 months. Natural vegetation consists primarily of disturbed pine flatwoods (FLUCFCS code 4119), and hydric melaleuca (FLUCFCS code 4241). This soil has severe limitations for sanitary facilities, building site development, and recreational uses primarily because of the high water table. 
•	14-Valkaria fine sand- This is nearly level, poorly drained soil on sloughs. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is at a depth of less than 10 inches for 1to 3 months. It is at a depth of 10 to 40 inches for about 6 months and recedes to a depth of more than 40 inches for about 3 months. During periods of high rainfall, the soil is covered by slowly moving water for periods of about 7 to 30 days or more. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include cleared areas (747), hydric cleared areas (7461), and hydric melaleuca (4241). The soil has severe limitations for urban development because of the high water table. 
•	26-Pineda fine sand- This is a nearly level, poorly drained soil on sloughs. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is within 10 inches of the surface for 2 to 4 months. It is 10 to 40 inches below the surface for more than 6 months, and it recedes to more than 40 inches below the surface for more than 6 months, and it recedes to more than 40 inches below the surface during extended dry periods. During periods of high rainfall, the soil is covered by a shallow layer of slowly moving water for periods of about 7 to 30 days or more. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include disturbed pine flatwoods (4119), disturbed palmetto prairie (3219), malaleuca (424), hydric melaleuca (4241) borrow area (742), and hydric cleared area (7461). This soil has severe limitations for urban development primarily because of the high water table. 
•	27-Pompano fine sand, depressional- This is a nearly level, poorly drained soil in depressions. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is within 10 inches of surface for 2 to 4 months and stands above the surface for about 3 months. It is 10 to 40 inches below the surface for more than 5 months. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include disturbed palmetto prairie (3219), disturbed pine flatwoods (4119), and hydric melaleuca (4241). In its natural state, this soil has severe limitations for septic tank absorption fields, swellings without basements, small commercials buildings, and local roads and streets. 
•	28-Immokalee sand- This is nearly level, poorly drained soil in flatwoods areas. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is within 10 inches of the surface for 1 to 3 months and 10 to 40 inches below the surface for 2 to 6 months. It recedes to a depth of more than 40 inches during extended dry periods. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include cleared areas (746). This soil has severe limitations for urban development because of high water table. 
•	39-Isles fine sand, depressional-This is a nearly level, very poorly drained soil depressions. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is above the surface for 3 to 6 months. It is within a depth of 10 to 40 for 2 to 4 months. The water table recedes to a depth of more than 40 inches during extended dry periods. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include hydric melaleuca (4241), cypress (621), disturbed cypress (6219), disturbed wet prairie (6439), and borrow area (742). Because of ponding, this soil has severe limitations for urban and recreational uses. Areas of this soil provide excellent habitat for wading birds and other wetland wildlife. 
•	42-Wabasso sand, limestone substratum-This is a nearly level, poorly drained soil of broad flatwoods. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is within 10 inches of the surface for 1 to 3 months. It is 10 to 40 inches below the surface for 2 to 4 months. It is below the limestone during extended dry periods. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include disturbed pine flatwoods (4119), hydric melaleuca (4241), and mixed wetland hardwoods (4381). This soil has severe limitations for urban development because of the high water table.
•	45-Copeland sandy loam, depressional- This is a nearly level, poorly drained soil in depressions. In most years, under natural conditions, the soil is ponded for about 3 to 6 months or more. The water table is within a depth of 10 to 40 inches for 4 to 6 months. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include hydric melaleuca (4241) and disturbed cypress (6219). This soil has severe limitations for urban and recreation uses because of prolonged ponding. 
•	49-Felda fine sand, depressional-This is a nearly level, poorly drained soil in depressions. In most years, under natural conditions, the soil is ponded for about 3 to 6 months or more. The water table is within a depth of 10 to 40 inches for 4 to 6 months. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include hydric melaleuca (4241) and disturbed cypress (6219). This soil has severe limitations for urban and recreation uses because of prolonged ponding. 
•	51-Floridana sand, depressional-This is a nearly level, very poorly drained soil in depressions. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is above the surface for 3 to 6 months or more. It is 10 to 40 inches below the surface during extended dry periods. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include freshwater marsh (641) and wet prairie (643). The soil has severe limitations for urban and recreation uses because of prolonged ponding. 2010-2020 Campus Master Plan Update 
•	69-Matlacha gravelly fine sand- This is a nearly level, somewhat poorly drained soil formed by filing and earthmoving operations (cleared area FLUCFCS code 746). The depth to the water table varies with the amount of fill material and the extent of artificial drainage. However, in most years, the water table is 24 to 36 inches below the surface of the fill material for 2 to 4 months. It is more than 60 inches below the surface during extended dry periods. Most of the natural vegetation has been removed. This soil has severe limitations for sanitary facilities and recreational uses and moderate limitations for most buildings site development. The high water table and sandy surface texture are the major limitations. Unstable surface material can severely limit shallow excavations, and the high water table severely limits use for dwellings with basements. In scattered areas where the fill material contains boulders or compacted material, the installation of underground utilities or functioning of septic tank absorption fields may be a problem. 
•	73-Pineda fine sand, depressional- This is a nearly level, very poorly drained soil in depressions. In most years, under natural conditions, the soil is ponded for about 3 to 6 months or more. The water table is within a depth of 10 to 40 inches for 4 to 6 months. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include Cypress (621), disturbed cypress (6219), hydric melaleuca (4241), freshwater marsh (641), fill area (744), and hydric cleared area (7461). This soil has severe limitations for urban and recreation uses because of prolonged ponding and sandy texture. 
•	74-Boca fine sand, slough- This is a nearly level, poorly drained soil in depression. In most years, under natural conditions, the water table is within 10 inches of the surface for 2 to 4 months. It is 10 to 40 inches below the surface from more than 4 months. During high rainfall, the soil is covered by a shallow layer of slowly moving water for periods of about 7 days to 1 month or more. FLUCFCS units occurring on this soil type include hydric melaleuca (4241), cypress (621), disturbed cypress (6219), disturbed fresh water marsh (6419), disturbed wet prairie (6439), borrow area (742), and cleared area (746). This soil has severe limitations for sanitary facilities and building site development, primarily because of the high water table. 

Vegetation 
The campus site was vegetated by a mosaic of vegetation communities composed of upland and wetland habitats. These communities represent both native habitats and areas significantly altered by past and current human activities. Protected plant species were found most commonly in native habitats, but also occur in areas that have undergone change and disturbance. Several areas, to some varied extent, were determined to have become infested with the problematic exotic 
tree Melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia). 

All major wetland and upland vegetation communities within the project site were mapped in the field during March and April, 1993, utilizing 1”=200’ scale unrectified aerial photography (March 1993). Extensive ground truthing and review of true color and false color infrared 1”=200’ scale aerial photograph (March 1, 1993) were utilized to confirm the location of boundaries between adjacent vegetative communities. The jurisdictional wetland vegetation communities onsite were flagged as the basis for binding jurisdictional determinations. These determinations were received, and the 
wetland boundaries surveyed. The results of these tasks are described in the permits for the site (USACOE Permit No. 199400807 and SFWMD Permit No. 36-02881S). 

A total of 22vegetative associations and/or land uses were delineated within the project site as identified in the SFWMD Permit. Sixteen are jurisdictional wetland areas, while the remaining six are upland. 
•	Palmetto Prairie, Disturbed- 21.3 acres or 2.8 percent of the site. 
•	 Pine Flatwoods, Disturbed- 396.0 acres or 52 percent of the project site. 
•	 Pine Flatwoods, Hydric, Disturbed 18.1 acres or 2.3 percent of the project site. 
•	 Melaleuca- 2.9 acres or 02.3 percent of the project site. 
•	 Melaleuca, Hydric- 72.1 acres or 9.4 percent of the project site. 
•	 Melaleuca, Hydric, Cypress- 1.3 acres or 0.01 percent of the project site. 
•	 Melaleuca, Hydric, Post-Burn- 10.8 acres or 1.4 percent of the project site. 
•	 Melaleuca, Hydric, Pine-Cypress- 4.0 acres or 0.5 percent of the project site. 
•	 Melaleuca, Hydric, Post-Scrape- 8.5 acres or 1.1 percent of the project site, located just south of a borrow lake north of the project site. 
•	Live Oak- 1.8 acres or 0.2 percent of the project site 
•	• Willow, Hydric- 0.5 acres or less than 0.1 percent of the project site 
•	Mixed Hardwoods, Hydric- 1.7 acres or 0.2 percent of the project site 
•	Drainage Canal – 3.1 acres or 0.4 percent of the project site 
•	Cypress, Disturbed- 123.0 acres or 16.1 percent of the project site. 
•	Freshwater Marsh- 18.7 acres or 2.4 percent of the project site. 
•	Freshwater Marsh, Disturbed- 10.6 acres or 1.3 percent of the project site. 
•	Wet Prairie- 6.4 acres or 0.8 percent of the project site, located between freshwater marsh (641) and disturbed pine flatwoods (4119). 
•	Wet Prairie, Disturbed- 28.0 acres or 3.6 percent of the project site. 
•	Borrow Areas- 0.8 acres or less than 0.1 percent of the project site, and consists mostly of open water. 
•	Fill Area- 0.5 acres or less than 0.1 percent of the project site, and consists of bare scraped earth and fill material both devoid of vegetation. 
•	Cleared Areas, Hydric- 12.7 acres or 1.6 percent of the project site. 
•	Berm- 0.4 acres or less than 0.1 percent of the project site. 

The major upland community within the project site is disturbed pine Flatwoods (FLUCFCS Code 4119) and the major wetland community is disturbed cypress (FLUCFCS Code 6219). 

Threatened and Endangered Plant Species 
Twenty-nine species of protected plants were observed on the project site, and consist of 1 endangered, 22 threatened, 5 commercially exploited, 1 candidate for listing. 

The most frequently encountered protected plants were:
•	dahoon holly (Ilex cassine)
•	stiff-leaved wild-pine (Tillandsia fasciculata)
•	golden polypody (Phlebodium aureum)
•	shoestring fern (Vittaria lineata)
•	southern shield fern (Thelypteris kunthii),
•	brake fern (Pteris vittata). 

The least common were:
•	branded wild-pine (Tillandsia flexuosa)
•	cigar orchid (Cyrtopodium punctatum)
•	pine lily (Lilium catesbaei)
•	giant ladies’ tresses (Spiranthes praecox), and strap fern (Camplyloneuron pyllitidus), only one or two locations for each species were found. 
•	Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) 
•	orchids (Orchideceae)
•	ferns and fern-allies (Osmundaceae, Polypodiaceae, Psilotaceae, Pteridaceae, Schizaceae, Thlypteridaceae, and Vittariaeae) were the best represented groups, yielding the most numbers of species overall. 

While the majority of protected plants were found in wetland areas such as cypress dominated wetlands, pine lily and brake fern occurred only in upland habitats such as disturbed pine flatwoods (FLUCFCS Code 4119) or disturbed palmetto prairie (FLUCFCS Code 3219). Brake fern and southern shield fern were often found in microhabitats such as the tops and sides of berms and mounds, which afford suitably drier conditions, even when located within wetland areas.
   
Wildlife 
Detailed wildlife surveys were conducted during the weeks of March 15 March 22, July 13 and August 30, 1993.  The pedestrian surveys consisted of two to three qualified ecologists walking a sufficient number of parallel overlapping belt transects through all suitable habitats to insure that 100 percent visual coverage of all ground and flora was observed. The ecologists were spaced between 25 feet and 100 feet apart depending on habitat visibility. Approximately 345 man hours were spent onsite conducting the surveys. 

Five protected wildlife species were observed during these surveys. Species observed during the surveys included two American alligators, one Eastern indigo snake, and a gopher tortoise population estimate of ±12 gopher tortoises (20 active gopher tortoise burrows). Listed wading bird species (e.g., white ibis, snowy egret) were observed during the study, as well as a bald eagle and a potential snail kite perch. These species may possibly forage within wetlands on the campus site. 

13.2 Current Condition 
From the early planning stages of the University, the direction of the permitting and utilization of the University site has been towards the stewardship and conservation of all the aspects of the sensitive environment receptors of Southwest Florida. This University’s charge was, and is, to be the “Environmental University”. To that end and in preparation for submittal of the initial conceptual permit for the property, plans were made in conjunction with the various regulatory permitting agencies to develop the University within the existing mosaic of uplands and wetlands on the property.

Unavoidable impacts to isolated wetland were mitigated by enhancing and preserving connected wetland and upland systems throughout the campus. This mitigation includes the preservation of conservation areas within the FGCU campus. A majority of the existing wetlands systems were identified to be conserved and integrated into the University campus system. These wetlands were designated for preservation and enhancement via restoration of hydroperiods and removal of exotic vegetative species. This effort includes the restoration of two degraded major slough area. Upland preserve areas were also included into the overall restoration and enhancement effort to provide buffers to wetland preserves and wildlife habitat. 

The phased development of the university has required that mitigation activities be completed in a phased manner consistent with construction activities on a basin by basin basis. The first phase of development involved construction within Basins 1 and 2 and involved approximately 29 acres of wetland impacts. Development within these basins involved the construction of a perimeter berm (on which the Loop Road was constructed); the development of the academic core buildings, and the construction of the main east/west entrance road. Mitigation activities for this phase of the development consisted of selective exotic vegetation removal from approximately 40 
acres of historic pine flatwoods and disturbed wetlands. In addition, 19 acres of lakes and wetlands were created in areas of disturbed uplands and wetlands. The mitigation conducted in conjunction with this phase of development occurred within South Florida Water management District (SFWMD) Wetland numbers 4,5,6,8 and 0, as well as surrounding uplands. 

The FGCU on-campus student housing development located within Basin 3 encompasses approximately 45 acres. Construction of the first and second phase of student housing and associated infrastructure impacted 13 acres of SFWMD jurisdictional wetlands. Mitigation for these impacts was accomplished via wetland creation (4 acres), upland preservation (21 acres), and wetland enhancement (39 acres). 
The next phase of development consisted of the north entrance road. The north entrance road extends from Ben Hill Griffin PKWY on the west to the University Loop Road to the east. In addition an east/west service road was constructed in the lakefront mixed-use parcel. A total of approximately 9 acres of wetland impacts resulted from this phase of development. The mitigation conducted in associated with the construction of the north entrance road and east service road involved land located in the western slough (SFWMD Wetland number 8) and an upland area located adjacent to the slough. Total mitigation acreage was 45 acres, of which 39 acres consisted of wetland enhancement, and 6 acres of wetland creation. 

Following construction of the north entrance road, development of the athletic and recreation fields within Basin 3 was initiated. Construction of the recreation fields and athletic facility area resulted in wetland impacts totaling 103 acres. In order to offset these impacts, 13 acres of wetlands were enhanced and/or preserved (SFWMD Wetland numbers 16, 18 and 22) and 13 acres of upland were preserved and enhanced. Three additional acres of wetlands and flow-ways were created in an area of disturbed pine flatwoods. The wetland and flow-way creation areas were part of the overall hydrological restoration planned for the eastern slough, and allow for a hydrologic connection between SFWMD Wetland numbers 15, 16, 18, 22 and 24. 

The next phase of development involving wetland impacts was the completion of the Loop Road, an additional parking area, and associated sidewalks and water management. This phase totaled approximately 20 acres. Wetland impacts for this phase totaled approximately 4 acres. Mitigation for the wetland impacts included 26 acres of wetland enhancement (SFWMD Wetland numbers 8, 11, 13 and 14), 14 acres of upland enhancement and preservation, and <1 acre of wetland creation. 

Development of the student housing in Basin 4, located in the southeast portion of the project, involved a crossing over the eastern slough (SFWMD Wetland number 24) a student housing facility and associated water management. The project area for this phase totaled approximately 52 acres and involved 4 acres of wetland impacts. Mitigation for this phase included 87 acres of wetland enhancement (SFWMD Wetland numbers 24, 27 and 28) and 46 acres of upland preservation. 
A 2-megawatt solar facility has been constructed on approximately 72 acres located near Ben Hill Griffin PKWY. 

Wetland impacts associated with the solar facility totaled less than 1 acre. The mitigation for this phase included approximately 12 acres of wetland enhancement (SFWMD Wetland numbers 1, 2 and 7) and 14 acres of upland preservation. 

Since 2005, FGCU has received 22 permit modifications from the SFWMD. These permits include, but are not limited to, recreation areas, academic buildings, roadway improvements, solar facility, boardwalk, student union and student housing. 

13.3 Projected Needs 

FGCU was initially planned with a focus on distance learning and with 3,000 beds for onsite student housing. While distance learning through online classes is still part of FGCU’s program, there has been an increase in demand for traditional classroom participation by students. It is more beneficial to address this increase in demand by providing onsite facilities for the students to live in because this will reduce future congestion for offsite roads. The reduced congestion on offsite roads allows for safer travel and reduced energy consumption. This has lead to an increase in the number beds planned for FGCU from 3,000 to 5,671. The North Lake Village student housing complex will contain 1,984 beds at build out and the South Village student housing complex will contain 3,687 beds at build out. 
The increase in capacity for the South Village student housing complex has necessitated the need for a secondary access. The South Village is currently accessed via a single road that connects to the Campus Loop Road. The increase in onsite student housing has also increased the need for other facilities, including recreational facilities. To address the increased demand for onsite student housing and recreational facilities, FGCU is currently planning a secondary access to the South Village through an adjacent property to Ben Hill Griffin PKWY. Any additional wetland impacts associated with this development will require permitting through the SFWMD and USACOE.

CAMPUS ECOSYSTEM MODEL (CEM):
Cypress Swamp (http://www.fgcu.edu/CAS/CEM/cypress.html) 
These regularly inundated wetlands form a forested border along large rivers, creeks, and lakes, or occur in depressions as circular domes or linear strands. Cypress swamp communities are strongly dominated by either bald cypress or pond cypress, with very low numbers of scattered black gum, red maple, and sweetbay. Understory and ground cover are usually sparse due to frequent flooding but may include such species as buttonbush, lizard's-tail, and various ferns. The canopy of a cypress swamp is dense, and is produced by cypress and other trees as well as epiphytic plants.

Lakes (http://www.fgcu.edu/CAS/CEM/lakes.html) 
In addition to being surrounded by water on three sides, Florida is also home to some 10,400 freshwater lakes, many of which are located in northern Florida. Of these, more than 7800 are larger than 0.4 hectares, covering a total of 9270 square kilometers, more than six-percent of Florida’s landscape (Myers & Ewel, 1990). Lakes are a common feature of the landscape in some areas of Florida due in part to the abundance of rainfall and the flat irregular surface that characterizes the State. Many of Florida’s lakes are highly diverse in their flora and fauna; for example, approximately 40 species of native fishes and 20 species of nonnative fishes inhabit these systems. Florida lakes are unusual in that underground tunnels often connect them; however, they are not as ""systemic"" as riverine and canal systems (Alden et al., 1998). Because of this, invasive exotics have not been as successful invading lake ecosystems. In addition to fish, many different species of invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, and water birds may be found in association with these lakes. Lakes not only harbor great numbers of plants and animals, but they also they also mitigate the surrounding microclimate. Extended, gradual heat release by lakes helps protect surrounding crops from freezing.

Mangrove Forests
Mangrove forests represent more than a collection of individual trees; they are a functioning system. Mangrove is a general term used to denote approximately 50 different salt-tolerant trees and shrubs occupying muddy, salt- and brackish-water shorelines (Gonick & Outwater, 1996). Although mangroves are also tolerant of freshwater, they are restricted to saltier environments because they are easily out-competed in freshwater systems (Nelson, 1994). These tropical species ""flourish in average annual temperature ranges of greater than 65 degrees�[with]�few hard freezes"" (Alden et al., 1998). In Florida, there are three true mangrove trees and an implied fourth: red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus), often referred to as the gray mangrove (Myers & Ewel, 1990). The buttonwood is a pseudo-mangrove because it is often found in association with white mangroves.

Two species were listed as potential impacts, the Corallorihiza wisteriana, Spring Coral-root and Quercus Phellos, willow oak.  For the Spring Coral root, site observations following DCNR Botanical Survey Protocols were used by the horticulturists during the bloom season in the spring within and around the wetlands for the stream and pond areas, none found.  Letter was sent to the PNDI.  The Quercus phellos were located on the site map and field located in the woods areas along with all know species on campus.  Although some were located near the stream work, none were in danger by the construction.  Letter and map sent to PADEP twice, once for the dorm construction and once for the streambank.

A survey was conducted by a licensed surveyor and mapped delineating the wetlands on campus along the stream and around the pond.  this survey was part of the application and incorporated into the design to protect these environmentally sensitive areas.  This was all done under the auspecies of Land Concepts, Inc.

Both of these methodologies were acceptable to the appropriate agencies. ","Haverford has an upper and lower pond.The entire area (10 acres)is designated as a pollinator garden by Penn State. The pond areas are a mix of woodlands, woody and herbaceous plants, mostly native species. A stream bank restoration project that stretches from the lower pond to the south property line was completed in 2013.
Haverford College's Willow Oaks have been identified by the PA DEP as endangered and a vulnerable species. ","Shifting from mowed lawn around the duck pond to wild meadow provides wildlife habitat and a reliable food source for animals, and can help reduce, or even eliminate storm water runoff and erosion.

Haverford began the move away from mowing five years ago starting in the Pinetum, which is now entirely meadow except for some paths mowed through for the College’s cross-country runners.  The Pinetum was also planted with wildflowers on the north end.",http://news.haverford.edu/blogs/goinggreen/page/2/,--

These inventories are used in identifying specific Natural Hazards and Natural Resources in the Corvallis Urban Growth Boundary that are protected according to the Natural Features and Natural Hazards provisions of the Corvallis Land Development Code.  http://www.corvallisoregon.gov/index.aspx?page=1049 

Examples of all three Corvallis area natural resource designations - wetlands, riparian corridors and significant vegetation can be found protected on the OSU campus.  Oak Creek, in particular, represents an expansive highly protected riparian corridor that OSU has worked to restore and protect. More information on protected riparian areas can be found at: http://www.corvallisoregon.gov/index.aspx?page=332

Significant vegetation on OSU's campus is also protected and deemed highly significant.  OSU protects these areas from development and development-related impacts.  More information on highly protected significant vegetation can be found here: http://www.corvallisoregon.gov/index.aspx?page=328 

",True,True,"OSU and the City of Corvallis, both independently and together, have identified wetlands and wildlife areas on the OSU Corvallis campus. More information about City's identification process can be found below and at this link: http://www.corvallisoregon.gov/index.aspx?page=332

How To Use This Inventory
The Natural Features Inventory is divided into four resource types: wetlands, riparian areas, wildlife habitat and tree groves. Each resource has a technical report that describes the detailed methodology with summary tables and analysis. Detailed data sheets can be found for each resource site. The maps are divided into two categories: water-related resources (wetlands and riparian areas) and upland resources (wildlife habitat and tree groves). Each resource category has three types of maps with increasing detail. A summary map identifies the resource location within the Corvallis UGB. The locator maps are divided by study area (north, west-central, south) and provide a map index to the detailed map sheets, using 2002 aerial photos as their base.

Inventory Methodology
Specific methods are used for each of the natural features in this inventory. The inventory and assessment methods described in this report are based on the Natural Features Scoping Project Report (2002) prepared by the Corvallis Natural Features Technical Advisory Committee (NFT AC). The scoping report provides clear direction regarding what natural features to inventory further and provides the methodological foundation for determining how to inventory the natural features. The functional values of each natural resource area are evaluated using ranking/point systems to allow comparisons among all areas with the same type of resources. Detailed descriptions of the methods are found in each of the technical reports. Briefly:

- Local Wetlands Inventory (L WI) - the L WI includes all wetlands at least 0.5 acres is size, either isolated or within riparian assessment areas or wildlife habitat assessment areas. The methods are determined by Oregon Division of State Lands (DSL)
administrative rules.! The L WI is unique in that it is the only resource in which ""significance"" of a local wetland is determined by state administrative rules. The Oregon Freshwater Assessment Methodology (OFW AM) is used to assess whether or not a wetland meets the criteria for a Local Significant Wetland (LSW).

- Riparian Assessment - the riparian assessment is conducted within riparian assessment areas (RAA), which vary in width depending on stream type (perennial or intermittent) and the presence of locally significant wetlands and/or continuous riparian vegetation.
The width of the RAA extends beyond the width of the riparian vegetation to identify potential offsite impacts. Each RAA is mapped with subareas or ""subpolygons"" that indicate different vegetative cover types (i.e. trees, shrubs, grasses, developed). The methodology is based on the Urban Riparian Inventory and Assessment Guide (URIAG) and a supplemental Riparian Corridor Survey to provide additional information on vegetation cover and stream conditions consistent with the NFTAC Scoping Report.

- Wildlife Habitat Assessment (WHA) - the wildlife habitat assessment includes all areas of at least five acres with natural vegetation, except for areas within riparian assessment areas. The WHA inventories and assess six general categories of habitat features or
conditions: water, food, cover, human disturbance, patch size and connectivity, and unique features. Vegetation subpolygons are defined within each WHA area based on vegetative cover types. Each vegetation subpolygon includes a description and characterization of the vegetation and identification of any rare, threatened or endangered species associations.

- Tree Grove Assessment (TGA) - tree grove assessments are conducted for all areas with trees that are predominantly 25 feet or more in height with a continuous canopy cover of 0.5 acres or more. The TGA distinguishes between isolated tree groves (less
than five acres in size) and vegetative subpolygons within WHA areas (greater than five acres), but does not include tree cover within developed areas or riparian assessment areas. The TGA evaluates tree groves for scenic, aesthetic, and other functional values.

Aerial photo interpretation is used to identify potential resource sites, which are then confirmed by field surveys. The fieldwork is conducted on-site where access permission is granted. Where access is not obtained, off-site assessments are conducted using aerial photographs, existing data sources, and observation from public lands and adjacent rights-of-way.

In many cases, resource boundaries overlap. For example, tree groves may be isolated or part of a wildlife habitat assessment area; or, a riparian corridor may be located within a wildlife habitat assessment area. Similarly, wetlands may be part of either a wildlife habitat assessment area or a riparian assessment area. The methodology ensures comprehensive coverage and consideration of multiple functional values for each type of resource (i.e. riparian areas serve as wildlife habitat), while avoiding ""double counting"" resources. ",Maps of these areas can be found at http://www.corvallisoregon.gov/index.aspx?page=328 ,"OSU takes multiple steps to protect wildlife habitat and sensitive areas on institutionally-owned land.  OSU and the City of Corvallis have identified over 626 acres of land that OSU now has deemed protected from development.  These areas currently fall into three categories highly protected riparian areas/corridors, highly protected significant vegetation, and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program-protected (CREP) land.  

Under the CREP, OSU's Dept. of Animal and Rangeland Sciences has restored and protected areas of Oak Creek that wind through livestock facilities. Supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, the project created wildlife habitat and riparian buffers along more than five miles of streams that include Oak Creek and its tributaries.  

OSU has done other work to restore runs of Oak Creek, an urban stream and riparian area that runs through the heart of the main campus and many of OSU's agricultural areas.  This work includes annual (or more frequent) stream cleanup events, removal of historical debris including dams and concrete, planting native plants, improved shading of the creek, fencing off the creek from animal areas to prevent direct access and work on stormwater outfalls to prevent erosion and slow and clean water using bioswales and other methods.  

Periodically, Oak Creek and its surrounding riparian area is used for academic course work, service learning requirements and research. ",http://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/operations/natural-features,--

Slippery Rock University has received a Conservation Award from the Bartramian Audubon Society for establishing four new Audubon wildlife sanctuaries since 2005. The sanctuaries, part of the University's green landscape and outdoor learning initiative, preserve 266.2 acres, including 151.2 acres on campus. The sanctuaries include 70.8 acres at the Robert A. Macoskey Center for Sustainable Systems Education and Research, 73 acres behind the Old Stone House (off campus), 42 acres of Miller forest on Wolf Creek (off campus), 16 acres of old growth forest off South Main Street, 10 acres at Wally Rose Ballpark, 23.7 acres at the Storm Harbor Equestrian Center, and 30.7 acres at the Branchton Road Sanctuary. 
",True,True,"The Bartramian Audubon Society, a local chapter of the National Audubon Society that was started by three Slippery Rock students in 1983, has been active in identifying, assessing, and monitoring SRU's Audubon Wildlife sanctuaries. 

SRU's biology department regularly assesses and identifies endangered or vulnerable species and environmentally sensitive areas, and has tagged specimen trees throughout campus. The biology department chair also chairs the university's Environmental Zoning Committee that reviews any proposed land use changes to SRU property. 

The SRU Office of Sustainability manages the Land Use Project Request process, in which appropriate groups such as the Environmental Zoning Committee are requested to review  proposed temporary or permanent outdoor property use by campus organizations and make recommendations to the President regarding whether the use is appropriate or requires restrictions to protect the natural environment.","In addition to a broad variety of bird and butterfly species, the Audubon Wildlife Sanctuaries at SRU are home to many wild animals including the White-Tailed Deer, Wild Turkey, Striped Skunk, both Red and Gray Squirrels, Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake, Gray Catbird, the American Woodcock, as well as many other species. The Audubon Sanctuaries on campus (noted above) also include sensitive wetlands areas, most prominently in the Branchton Road sanctuary area. ","The charter of the Environmental Zoning Committee is essentially to protect and/or positively affect identified species, habitats and environmentally-sensitive areas on campus.
