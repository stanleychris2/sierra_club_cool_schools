13.	S(us)tain- Sustain is defined as, Conserving an ecological balance by avoiding depletion of natural resources (Google). These two definitions are in essence what our larger goal is for. So let me change the definitions around in our terms and it'll show what we're working toward. So the first definition is good, but we want that certain rate or level to be a happy one. Based upon support, positive communication and trust. The second definition is also a goal of ours however we want the term ecological to be more generalized. We want a general balance for our school by avoiding the depletion of general resources. So we work hard for the environment but that is not the only resource that sustains FGCU. Community, hard-work, purpose, and changing the things we as a community feel are unnecessary. It's good to see us maintaining :), but let's start sustaining. <- our motto, and tentative constitution.

Haverford College,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:39:29,ckent@haverford.edu,2.0,Pursuing,**,True,"Committee on Environmental Responsibility

Mission: The Committee for Environmental Responsibility (CER) was created by the students, faculty and staff of Haverford College and founded on the socially responsible principles of the college. CER has a deep concern and respect for all communities of which it is a part, both social and ecological. Our mission, therefore, is to educate our community towards an awareness of global concerns and to set a positive example of forward thinking, environmental stewardship for our campus and for other colleges to follow. To do this, CER works to ensure that environmental concern is an integral part of Haverford College’s daily life informing our curriculum, administrative decisions and maintenance of facilities and grounds.

History: At the fall plenary meeting of 2000, the students of Haverford College voted to form the Committee on Environmental Responsibility Resolution on campus. The resulting Committee for Environmental Responsibility (CER) was composed of four students appointed by Student’s Council, two professors, two staff members, and an administrator appointed by the President of the College, and was charged with creating an environmental policy for Haverford. Over the next two years, CER members researched college environmental policies, presented drafts of policies at faculty and staff meetings, and held open community meetings on the evolving policy. In the fall of 2003, the policy, A Vision For a Green Haverford, was formally accepted by the President and senior administrators, and is official college policy. The policy affirms Haverford’s support of environmental principles and guides current and future college practices. Additionally, CER was recognized as a Presidential Committee, and as such is directly responsible to the president and senior administration.

Due in a large part to CER’s efforts, the Gardner Integrated Athletic Center was built with environmental principles in mind, and received LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification at the Gold level. It is one of the first LEED certified athletic buildings in the country. Other projects that CER continues to be involved in include developing an environmental curriculum at Haverford, raising student awareness through campus wide energy and paper saving campaigns, and bringing composting to the dining hall.",http://news.haverford.edu/blogs/goinggreen/,True,"The Haverford Garden Initiative
A student organization with a mission to create food gardens and similar green spaces on campus for the benefit and use of the Haverford community. We seek to reconnect the Haverford community to the physical landscape and to the process of food production that is rooted in the land. By providing spaces for sustainable food production and education, the Haverford Garden Initiative contributes to Haverford’s commitment to environmental sustainability. We envision the gardens as both academic and recreational spaces where students and other community members can work alongside one another for fun, for educational purposes, or for research projects.

More concretely, we are currently responsible for the Student Garden found in the Haverford College Apartments (off of Ardmore Avenue). Our organization is successfully growing a large quantity of vegetables including tomatoes, green beans, peppers, lettuces, cucumbers, potatoes, radishes, beets, onions, peas, cauliflower, and herbs. In the coming year, we hope to move to a larger site on campus and to secure funding for an official campus farm.

The Haverfarm is part of a burgeoning program called ACES, which stands for the Agricultural Center for Environmental Studies. The program is the brain child of the 2014 senior capstone in environmental studies that sought to utilize the interdisciplinary expertise of the students in the class to make a positive impact on the Haverford community by more deeply embedding environmental issues and consciousness into the campus. The center seeks to engage the intersection of environmental issues and agriculture on campus. 

At the moment the program is attempting to make institutional, community and academic connections to promote institutional memory. There is a working group focusing on building a proposal for a premanent greenhouse that would serve as the center for ACES, and would provide a place for students to engage with farming for the entire academic year. The Haverfarm is the farm component of the center. At the moment, the Haverfarm is beginning its first season in two locations on campus, growing vegetables on approximately 1/5th of an acre. The farm is recognized as a student club and has nearly 20 active members, and at least double regular volunteers. In its first season, the Haverfarm hopes to engage the interest of many underclassmen students in agriculture, and give its produce to the campus community, as well as the local Ardmore Food Bank.

    2. Carter Road Capital: Is a student run microfinance initiative at Haverford that provides loans to small businesses in the area who otherwise would not have access to capital. The club has done national and international research prior to actually making loans and will make its first loans in spring 2014
  3. Impact Investing: 
    Mi3 has joined Investors Circle (IC), an angel network focused on impact investing. Mi3 participates in the IC Philly group that meets monthly, inviting entrepreneurs to pitch their business plans to the IC Philly Investors. Utilizing students in an Impact Investing course and subsequent Independent studies, Mi3 conducts due diligence on potential investments in order to direct funds from the foundation of a Haverford Alum. 
     
    Mi3 recently helped close its first investment, a $25,000 purchase of a convertible note in a LED design and manufacturing firm. Mi3 is currently exploring two other investments, including one into a firm that provides funding for energy retrofits for organizations  with sub 50,000 buildings that are usually excluded from standard bank lending.

Speaker series draws government officials, community leaders and citizen advocates to campus to spark lively discussion on pressing sustainability-related topics. The series addresses the problems and solutions of sustainability, from global climate change and rural poverty to new business models and investment strategies. Our distinguished speakers include expert practitioners and leaders from across the nonprofit, government, and corporate sectors.


Bill Clinton spoke at the Fine Arts Auditorium about pressing issues facing the world that his Clinton Initiative is set to help. Clinton encouraged change for a better world through education, community service and sustainability efforts. He touched on issues such as the world’s fundamental character of interdependence and its profound negative forces of inequality, instability, and unsustainability. Clinton asserted the importance of the United States to be more competitive in education in order to decrease the withdrawal rates of high school students and increase higher performance rates. Clinton suggested the withdrawal rate comes from students needing to work to help families financially. He purposed that if more high schools were developed like colleges, students could work while pursuing their education. Clinton also addressed prevailing community issues with a central focus on sustainability solutions through his foundation. One possible solution involved establishing solar panels and windmills to create zero emissions campuses. This more sustainable living would preserve energy, be more efficient and create more jobs opportunities for the community.

Bill Nye, a STEM Ambassador and engineer by trade has dedicated his life to the promotion of science to children, explaining the importance of STEM education to North America’s economic and environmental future. As a featured guest speaker at UTPA, Nye discussed the importance of STEM for the future of America. Nye addressed topics such as the positive global environmental impacts of STEM education by emphasizing the need to look to scientists and especially engineers to address climate change and the steady increase in the world’s human population. Nye stressed the importance of having big ideas that are technically feasible. The keys to the future will be new ideas and innovations that don’t have people just consuming less of the Earth’s resources, but providing for more of us with less. Nye believes we need to make our world more efficient so that we can provide a high standard of living to people everywhere.

Robert F. Kennedy appeared as a guest speaker at The University of Texas-Pan American and discussed “Our Environmental Destiny” with UTPA students. Barely stopping to take a breath, Kennedy ran the gamut from global warming to religion, from corporate corruption of our government to why we must impeach President Bush. He often surprised the audience by quoting Republican presidents such as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, declaring that today’s NeoCons have dishonored everything these great American leaders stood for. Kennedy characterized protecting our natural environment as a service to God and thus, ourselves. He asserted that nature is part of our infrastructure, and that it enriches us aesthetically and spiritually. Nature ultimately connects us to God; it is the way God talks to us most forcefully. He pointed out numerous cases in which lobbyists and other industry representatives were given key positions in federal environmental programs and used their authority to help industries subvert the law. Kennedy would return to that theme more than once in his speech. And while he said he loathed partisanship and said the worst thing that could happen to environmentalism would be for it to become the province of one political party. 


America Ferrera shared her life and causes which she is most passionate about with UTPA students and the community. Her most recent project is a 9-part Showtime documentary television series focusing on global warming, entitled “Years of Living Dangerously.” The weekly episodes feature celebrity investigators, who each have a history of environmental activism, and well-known journalists, each of whom have a background in environmental reportage. These correspondents travel to areas around the world and throughout the U.S. affected by global warming to interview experts and ordinary people affected by, and seeking solutions to, the effects of global warming. These actors, activists and reporters act as proxies for the audience, asking questions to find out people's opinions and to discover the scientific evidence.

He offers a wake-up call to collective action and, unless we don’t, believes it will soon be too late for us to pass along the American dream to future generations. Friedman is an internationally renowned author, reporter and columnist. He is the recipient of three Pulitzer Prizes and author of five bestselling books including “From Beirut to Jerusalem,” “The World is Flat,” and “Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution – and How It Can Renew America.”

Dr. Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, best-selling author and populizer of science, spoke with UTPA students about the importance of science in many fields, including medicine, computer science, space exploration and even banking and commerce. Dr. Kaku offered a perspective of his field to UTPA students that opened their minds to the future of quantum physics and space travel. Dr. Kaku delivered keynotes at HESTEC’s Educator Day and Student Leadership Day. He is the co-founder of string field theory, and is continuing Einstein’s search to unite the four fundamental forces of nature into one unified theory that will summarize all the physical laws of the universe. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair in Theoretical Physics at the City University of New York, and has taught at Harvard and Princeton.

Philippe Cousteau, explorer, social entrepreneur, environmental advocate and the grandson of famous explorer Jacques Yves Cousteau, spoke with hundreds of Rio Grande Valley high school students who attended Student Leadership Day at the UTPA’s HESTEC. He asserted the importance in finding innovative ways to fix the damage that has been done to the earth and to improve the lives of the global population. Cousteau, who co-founded the nonprofit environmental education program EarthEcho International with his relatives, showed video clips of stories he did for CNN on the deteriorating health of the coral reels off the coast of Key West, Fl., and how one community in Haiti began gardens to provide food security to their neighborhoods. He encouraged the students to think of ways to help their own communities, to set goals and to believe in their dreams.


Office For Sustainability Speaker Series
As the world increasingly seeks environmentally-friendly solutions to more complex problems, Jay Harman’s biomimetic message gains more and more attention. An award-winning entrepreneur and biomimetic inventor, Jay Harman has taken a hands-on approach to his lifelong fascination with the deep patterns found in nature. In the process, he has founded and grown multi-million-dollar research and manufacturing companies that develop, patent, and license innovative products, ranging from prize-winning watercraft to interlocking building bricks, afterburners for aircraft engines, and non-invasive technology for measuring blood glucose and other electrolytes. He is credited with being among the first pioneering scientists to make biomimicry—the science of employing nature in advancing sustainable technology—a cornerstone of modern and future engineering. His latest ventures—PAX Scientific, PAX Water Technologies, PAX Mixer, and PAX Pure—design more efficient industrial equipment including refrigeration, turbines, fans, mixers, and water treatment based on Jay’s revolutionary concepts. Aside from his entrepreneurial exploits, Jay started a boarding school to teach kids about the environment in Australia—and made it his mission to bring the subject of biomimicry to the public. Born and raised in Australia, Jay started his career as a naturalist with the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, but quickly demonstrated talents as an inventor. In 1982, he founded ERG, Ltd, which grew into one of Australia’s largest technology firms with a capital value as high as $3 billion. Since then, Jay has been at the helm of numerous companies recognized as global leaders in their respective fields. The culmination of Jay’s work is the development of “Nature’s Streamlining Principle,” a guideline for translating nature’s extraordinary efficiencies into industrial applications. Jay’s goal—both as an author and an entrepreneur—is to show industry that improving the efficiency of industrial equipment is beneficial for both the bottom line, and the planet.

He purposed that if more high schools were developed like colleges, students could work while pursuing their education. Clinton also addressed prevailing community issues with a central focus on sustainability solutions through his foundation. One possible solution involved establishing solar panels and windmills to create zero emissions campuses. This more sustainable living would preserve energy, be more efficient and create more jobs opportunities for the community.


Bill Nye, a STEM Ambassador and engineer by trade has dedicated his life to the promotion of science to children, explaining the importance of STEM education to North America’s economic and environmental future. As a featured guest speaker at UTPA, Nye discussed the importance of STEM for the future of America. Nye addressed topics such as the positive global environmental impacts of STEM education by emphasizing the need to look to scientists and especially engineers to address climate change and the steady increase in the world’s human population. Nye stressed the importance of having big ideas that are technically feasible. The keys to the future will be new ideas and innovations that don’t have people just consuming less of the Earth’s resources, but providing for more of us with less. Nye believes we need to make our world more efficient so that we can provide a high standard of living to people everywhere.

Robert F. Kennedy appeared as a guest speaker at The University of Texas-Pan American and discussed “Our Environmental Destiny” with UTPA students. Barely stopping to take a breath, Kennedy ran the gamut from global warming to religion, from corporate corruption of our government to why we must impeach President Bush. He often surprised the audience by quoting Republican presidents such as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, declaring that today’s NeoCons have dishonored everything these great American leaders stood for. Kennedy characterized protecting our natural environment as a service to God and thus, ourselves. Kennedy asserted that nature is part of our infrastructure. It enriches us aesthetically and spiritually. Nature ultimately connects us to God; it is the way God talks to us most forcefully. He pointed out numerous cases in which lobbyists and other industry representatives were given key positions in federal environmental programs and used their authority to help industries subvert the law. Kennedy would return to that theme more than once in his speech. And while he said he loathed partisanship and said the worst thing that could happen to environmentalism would be for it to become the province of one political party. 

America Ferrera shared her life and causes which she is most passionate about with UTPA students and the community. Her most recent project is a 9-part Showtime documentary television series focusing on global warming, entitled “Years of Living Dangerously.” The weekly episodes feature celebrity investigators, who each have a history of environmental activism, and well-known journalists, each of whom have a background in environmental reportage. These correspondents travel to areas around the world and throughout the U.S. affected by global warming to interview experts and ordinary people affected by, and seeking solutions to, the effects of global warming. These actors, activists and reporters act as proxies for the audience, asking questions to find out people's opinions and to discover the scientific evidence. 

In his latest book, “That Used to Be Us: How America Fell Behind the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back,” Thomas L. Friedman spoke to UTPA students about making recommendations for meeting four major challenges currently facing the United States: globalization, the information technology revolution, chronic deficits and unbalanced energy consumption. He offers a wake-up call to collective action and, unless we don’t, he believes it will soon be too late for us to pass along the American dream to future generations. Friedman is an internationally renowned author, reporter and columnist. He is the recipient of three Pulitzer Prizes and author of five bestselling books including “From Beirut to Jerusalem,” “The World is Flat,” and “Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution – and How It Can Renew America.”


Dr. Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, best-selling author and populizer of science, spoke with UTPA students about the importance of science in many fields, including medicine, computer science, space exploration and even banking and commerce. Dr. Kaku offered a perspective of his field to UTPA students that opened their minds to the future of quantum physics and space travel. Dr. Kaku delivered keynotes at HESTEC’s Educator Day and Student Leadership Day. He is the co-founder of string field theory, and is continuing Einstein’s search to unite the four fundamental forces of nature into one unified theory that will summarize all the physical laws of the universe. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair in Theoretical Physics at the City University of New York, and has taught at Harvard and Princeton.


Philippe Cousteau, explorer, social entrepreneur, environmental advocate and the grandson of famous explorer Jacques Yves Cousteau, spoke with hundreds of Rio Grande Valley high school students who attended Student Leadership Day at the UTPA’s HESTEC. He asserted the importance in finding innovative ways to fix the damage that has been done to the earth and to improve the lives of the global population. Cousteau, who co-founded the nonprofit environmental education program EarthEcho International with his relatives, showed video clips of stories he did for CNN on the deteriorating health of the coral reels off the coast of Key West, Fl., and how one community in Haiti began gardens to provide food security to their neighborhoods. He encouraged the students to think of ways to help their own communities, to set goals and to believe in their dreams.

As the world increasingly seeks environmentally-friendly solutions to more complex problems, Jay Harman’s biomimetic message gains more and more attention. An award-winning entrepreneur and biomimetic inventor, Jay Harman has taken a hands-on approach to his lifelong fascination with the deep patterns found in nature. In the process, he has founded and grown multi-million-dollar research and manufacturing companies that develop, patent, and license innovative products, ranging from prize-winning watercraft to interlocking building bricks, afterburners for aircraft engines, and non-invasive technology for measuring blood glucose and other electrolytes. He is credited with being among the first pioneering scientists to make biomimicry—the science of employing nature in advancing sustainable technology—a cornerstone of modern and future engineering. His latest ventures—PAX Scientific, PAX Water Technologies, PAX Mixer, and PAX Pure—design more efficient industrial equipment including refrigeration, turbines, fans, mixers, and water treatment based on Jay’s revolutionary concepts. Aside from his entrepreneurial exploits, Jay started a boarding school to teach kids about the environment in Australia—and made it his mission to bring the subject of biomimicry to the public. Born and raised in Australia, Jay started his career as a naturalist with the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, but quickly demonstrated talents as an inventor. In 1982, he founded ERG, Ltd, which grew into one of Australia’s largest technology firms with a capital value as high as $3 billion. Since then, Jay has been at the helm of numerous companies recognized as global leaders in their respective fields. The culmination of Jay’s work is the development of “Nature’s Streamlining Principle,” a guideline for translating nature’s extraordinary efficiencies into industrial applications. Jay’s goal—both as an author and an entrepreneur—is to show industry that improving the efficiency of industrial equipment is beneficial for both the bottom line, and the planet.


Kevin Wilhelm, a pre-eminent consultant in the field of business sustainability and climate change spoke with UTPA students about the ways to develop skills using sustainability to drive profit, business value and innovation. He is the CEO of Sustainable Business Consulting & Education, a Seattle-based consulting firm focused on delivering business value through the integration of sustainability. He is also an acclaimed author, speaker and teacher and has developed a series of online courses and modules around sustainability for both the corporate world and academic markets.


Joel Berg is leading the anti-hunger movement in America. He is executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. He is also author of All You Can Eat: How Hungry is America?, the definitive and most well-reviewed book on American hunger in the last decade. Berg spoke with UTPA students on how we can work together towards a more equitable society. Berg has led the Coalition Against Hunger, which represents more than 1,100 nonprofit soup kitchens and food pantries in New York City and the more than 1.5 million low-income New Yorkers who live in households that cannot afford enough food. The organization works not only to meet these residents’ immediate food needs but also to enact innovative solutions to help society move, “beyond the soup kitchen” to ensure self-sufficiency for all Americans. 

Seth Patterson is an avid naturalist and self-taught photographer who first discovered photography as a means to share his passion for nature with the world. Now a lifelong pursuit, Seth focuses on using his photography as a tool to help educate and inspire conservation in his native Texas home as well as during his travels across the globe. Patterson took the UTPA students on a visual journey through the pages of “El Valley – The Rio Grande Delta”, a coffee-table book that was awarded a Gold Medal in the 2001 Independent Publisher of the Year contest. Seth is both a freelance photographer as well as an employee of Gorgas Science Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on conservation through education. Seth’s work for GSF centers on imagery and incorporates much of his photography and graphics design abilities.

As part of the UTPA’s Earth week, the College of Arts and Humanities students hosted the Recycled Art Exhibit at the Library Gallery. The students were given a month to work on their pieces and were told to use different artistic means to express how they see the world.  The artwork featured used traditional methods such as paint, ceramics and sculptures, but also incorporated recycled materials such as, aluminum cans and tree parts. The exhibit displayed a variety of artistic style, inspiring onlookers to consider the positive impact of a sustainable world.

Mariachi Aztlan
Cruzar La Cara de La Luna
•	http://www.utpa.edu/news/2014/06/mariachi-aztlan-and-lyric-opera-of-chicago-continue-exciting-fusion-of-two-genres.htm

The Mariachi Aztlán performed “Cruzar La Cara de La Luna,” the world’s first mariachi opera, with the Houston Opera Company. Their outstanding performance caught the attention of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, who then invited them to performed “Canciones y Arias” with the Lyric Opera cast. In addition to a mesmerizing performance, the group’s directors, Guerra and Francisco Loera and members of the Mariachi Aztlán, participated in community engagement and educational activities that are organized by Lyric Unlimited, an initiative of the Lyric Opera of Chicago to expand their community engagement and educational programs throughout the Chicago area, particularly those areas where opera is a lesser known genre. The engagement activities include lecture demonstrations for students in the nearby community of Waukegan and the largely Hispanic Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen, workshops for both instructors and students of the Chicago Mariachi Project and Q&A sessions with students following dress rehearsals and performances. Additionally, Mariachi Aztlán played side by side with student performers at planned and impromptu sessions. We contend that artistic work is essential both for cultural heritage through the work’s reference and re-interpretation of culture, and for sustainability as a reflection on the current and future state of society. Artistic work is often considered an intangible cultural asset, and hence, the contribution of creative workers is often overlooked in a policy environment and is reflection on the current and future state of society. More practically, exploring musical artifacts and performance practices from different cultures and times can contribute to our understanding of cultural heritage and highlight cultural sustainability as an essential professional disposition.
