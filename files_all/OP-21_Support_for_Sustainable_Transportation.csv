Binghamton University professor recognized for being a ‘supercommuter’:
Binghamton University Associate Professor of Biological Sciences Julian Shepherd was recently awarded the Supercommuter Distinction award, by PlanetBike, a major producer of bicycle products. The recognition as defined by PlanetBike honors individuals who ride through every season, in all types of weather, day and night, and simply prefer to ride a bike instead of a car.

Shepherd was nominated as a perfect example of the dedication a supercommuter embodies by friend and colleague, Matthew Johnson, who notes: “The only time I saw him not go to work on a bike is when there was so much snow that he skied to work instead.”

For the past 48 years, Shepherd has made commuting by bike part of his life and as a year-round rider, faces all sorts of weather challenges. A resident of Binghamton, New York, Shepherd has been a fan of the bicycle’s simplicity since childhood, which was spent in England. For decades, he has continued his passion for riding, and while he never had the desire to pursue racing or touring, Shepherd has always used a bike as his primary means of transportation. What started as an easy and inexpensive way to get around while in grad school in the 1960s has become an almost daily ritual.

Shepherd takes on his daily 7-mile commute aboard a Jamis cyclocross bike and although he isn’t anti car, he often lets the auto commuters he shares the road with, know why he’s riding his bike. “I like to wear a t-shirt designed by Earth Day students which has ‘ONE LESS CAR’ printed across the back, “says Shepherd. “Although it is not the best use of English, it sure gets the point across.

One of the most common concerns shared by commuters is being stranded without access to a car. The Regional GRH program helps alleviate this concern by providing employees who commute to work in LMU vanpools with a reimbursed ride home in the event of a valid emergency. This is a version of “commuter insurance” for people who partipate in LMU vanpools. The Regional GRH program allows you to choose the most efficient means to get where you need to go during a qualified emergency. If you are without your car and experience an emergency, the GRH program will reimburse your ride, whether you choose a one-way taxi ride, one-day car rental, or transit ticket (public bus or Metrolink).",True,"-	Loyola Marymount University has implemented a carpool matching program with the faculty and staff.

After, an email is sent out to all compatible respondents who can contact each other and set up their own carpools. 
Partnering with vRide, LMU offers a rideshare service which helps individuals with a long commute more enjoyable. While the details of the arrangement are up to the individuals of each group, vRide offers a simple and effective way to filter through hundreds of other commuters just like you looking to save money, time and the environment. Once a member of the vRide network you can either create your own carpool or request to join an existing carpool or vanpool.

When your carpool grows to a certain size vRide will reach out the group contact and ask if the members would be interested in forming a vanpool, which saves even more money and time for members, all while covered by vRide's vehicle insurance policy. vRide conducts background checks, offers emergency rides home and provides all regular maintenance for the van.

LMU considers telecommuting to be a viable work option in certain circumstances which, when properly implemented and administered, benefit both the University and the telecommuter.  Telecommuting does not change the basic terms and conditions of employment with the University.  All University employees, including telecommuters, are subject to the University’s employment policies and procedures.

“Telecommuting” is the substitution of telecommunication technologies, including, but not limited to, telephones, facsimile machines, computers, electronic mail, and modems for travel to the University’s offices.   Telecommuting is not a right, but rather, a privilege which may be granted at management’s sole discretion to high performing individuals whose duties are suited to such an arrangement.  Telecommuting is voluntary.  Employees will not be required to telecommute.

“Telecommuters” are employees who work for the University from a home, or other remote office, for some part of the regularly scheduled workweek.",True,"Some Loyola Marymount University Employees have adopted a condensed work week. For example, Public Safety employees changed to 4/10 shifts. This means that each employee will work 10 hours shifts for only four days of the week, eliminating one commuting day per week. ",True,"Loyola Marymount University does have a program that encourages and facilitates its employees to live close to campus. LMU's Rental Assistance Program partially subsidizes rent with the faculty member contributing 25% of gross monthly household income. Size of household determines degree of assistance. Security deposit advances are also available. All rental units are located within a ten-mile radius of campus, keeping them within the local community. LMU also owns houses in the immediate neighborhood where 13 faculty and staff live within one mile from campus.

Established arrival and departure times should be consistent day to day and week to week. When necessary, individual offices or departments have the option of revising these arrival/departure hours to meet specific needs with the approval of the direct report. This optional authority includes the flexibility to schedule a compressed workweek, again with the approval of the direct report, but also subject to review by the Director of Employment Services. The Director of Employment Services will review compressed work week proposals to ensure that the following standards are met:
1.	Arrival and departure times, and days of work, are consistent day to day and week to week; 
2.	Employees are notified at the inception of the compressed work week schedule that scheduled days may not be moved to accommodate holidays or vacation scheduling, except that if the employee's scheduled day off falls on a scheduled College holiday, the number of hours that the employee normally works can be taken off any time during that month's pay period (exempt) or bi-weekly pay period (nonexempt) with agreement of the supervisor, and the holiday benefit will be equalized to the employee's regular FTE (full time equivalent) pay;

•	illness or injury experienced by you or a family member
•	damage to your home or property by fire, burglary, or acts of nature
•	university-wide emergencies where no other travel options are available
•	unscheduled overtime (supervisor authorization is required)
When an employee has an emergency on a day he or she commutes to work via Mountain Line, a signed voucher will be issued by Human Resources and the employee will call a taxi from the provider list. Northern Arizona Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority (NAIPTA) will pay for the ride.

The term ""flexible scheduling"" encompasses many variations from the standard work schedule. The more complicated the arrangements, the more record keeping and supervision of the program is required. In its simplest form, a flexible schedule involves allowing an employee to vary the span of the workday.

Flexible scheduling can be as simple as changing the work hours from an 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. workday to a 7:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. workday, changing the lunch break from one hour to one-half hour, or working an extra hour on Monday in order to leave an hour earlier on Tuesday.
Flexible scheduling can be more complicated, allowing an employee to establish her/his own start/end times and/or lunch break, within predetermined guidelines.
Even if a supervisor has not instituted a formal flexible scheduling program, employee requests for temporary changes in the workday such as to take a class, or to go to a doctor's appointment without charging sick leave, may be granted by the supervisor, provided such requests are in accordance with the provisions of this guideline. 

Although it is permissible, with the supervisor's approval, for a nonexempt staff employee to alter when the 40 hours are worked during the workweek, such employee cannot ""bank"" overtime hours worked in one workweek for use as time off in a future workweek. Further, the employee must understand that altered schedules cannot cause overtime to occur.

",True,"Rice University recognizes there are competing interests within the university community regarding the safe use of bicycles on the campus.  Because of the campus layout, it is the current practice that bicycles and pedestrians share many campus sidewalks (meaning all outdoor walkways on campus regardless of how they are surfaced).

Cyclists desire bicycle regulations that do not unfairly impair the use of bicycles for transportation on the campus.  To balance these and other competing interest, and maintain a safe environment for pedestrians and bicyclists, the university has adopted a Bicycle Safety Policy and related operational guidelines for all riders in an effort to address the needs of all interested parties.

The University will be launching a mobile parking application to allow customers to pay for parking via mobile network. This will allow direct parking as opposed to going to a booth, paying, and then driving to location. This will help minimize unnecessary driving and will cut down on our carbon footprint. 

The University will be launching a public awareness campaign regarding parking lots. The University has many open parking spaces on State & Dutch Quads. However, vehicles still attempt to park in full parking lots circling until a space is found wasting fuel and adding to the carbon footprint. We will attempt a campaign targeting this group with signage, videos, and PSA’s.

This program was financed through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. As part of this program the University was able to obtain 5 hybrid electric buses which are still in use. 

Membership to the International Parking Institute (IPI). They are the largest and leading association of parking professionals and the parking industry. IPI's purpose is advancing the parking profession through leadership, education, professional development, conferences, connections, data collection, advocacy, & outreach. We also serve on the IPI-ITS task force. The ITS Parking Task Force discusses how ITS and parking can work together to improve a driver's experience and explores many opportunities to collaborate between these two systems. We have been invited to give the IPI-ITS presentation statewide on a couple of occasions. 

Membership to the New York State Parking Association. The NYSPA is a statewide organization created to enhance the development of parking professionals within the State of New York to provide a forum in which New York State parking professionals can network, share and disseminate information specific to the parking industry, and to speak with a united voice.

On a long-term scale:

The University will attempt to add sensors in the parking lots and add VMS at critical campus entry points to alert vehicles of available lots (i.e. Lot A is full but Lot B has 200 spaces).This will also cut down above tendency. This will also be tied into a mobile application. Timeframe 3-10 years. 

The University is also looking at a permit less system where by your license plate would be your parking credential. The License Plate Recognition (LPR) system will assist with targeted enforcement as opposed to driving in all lots looking for offenders. Additionally, customers will be able to interact and register online or over the phone thus eliminating a need to drive to the parking office. Timeframe 2-3 years.

Pedestrians and bicyclists significantly outnumber vehicles on most college campuses. Campus sustainability is dependent on the adequacy of facilities in order to accommodate the high number of trips generated from pedestrians and bicyclists. Facilities accommodating these mode choices include bicycle lanes, and sidewalks and pedestrian pathways which are present throughout the campus.  Between 2005 and 2010, the network was expanded to provide better sidewalk connectivity along Holly Drive, Magnolia Drive, Laurel Drive, Beard Drive, Alumni Drive, Elm Drive, and several other locations. Along the perimeter roads of the campus, sidewalks are present along Fowler Avenue and 50th Street. Crosswalks are marked at most intersections and numerous mid-block locations throughout campus and at gateway intersections along the campus perimeter.

New sidewalks or pathways are planned along Magnolia Drive, Pine Drive, Alumni Drive, Leroy Collins Boulevard, Maple Drive, Bull Run Drive, Bruce B. Downs Boulevard, Fletcher Avenue, and several other locations. The long range pedestrian network, showing both existing and planned sidewalk and pathways, is shown in Figure 5.5.

Bicycle lanes are provided on roadways or pathways throughout the campus. Existing bicycle lanes are present along one or both sides of sections of Magnolia Drive, Leroy Collins Boulevard, Beard Drive, Holly Drive, Maple Drive, Palm Drive, Alumni Drive, Elm Drive, and Willow Drive. Bicycle signage is posted along selected bicycle lanes within campus. Bicycle lanes are also marked on all public roadways surrounding the campus (Fowler Avenue, Bruce B.

Alternative Work Patterns
State policy encourages the use of alternative work patterns by full-time or part-time employees when such schedules are consistent with efficient and effective University operations. Alternative work patterns include job sharing; alternate work weeks such as four, ten-hour days; and, staggered work hours, such as 7:00 a.m. – 3:30 p.m., with a thirty-minute lunch break. Requests for alternative work patterns should be made to the employee’s immediate supervisor who will determine if the proposal is
feasible for the work unit.

Wisconsin State Stat 230.215
(1)  Declaration of policy. The legislature finds and declares: 
(1)(a) (a) That employment practices which provide flexibility in scheduling hours of work often result in increased worker productivity, reduced absenteeism, improved employee morale and a more economical and efficient use of energy, highways and other transit systems. 
230.215(1)(b) (b) That traditional full-time work patterns fail to meet the needs of many potentially productive citizens who, due to age, health or family circumstances, are effectively prevented from engaging in full-time employment. 
230.215(1)(c) (c) That a greater number of permanent part-time employment opportunities are necessary to allow citizens a higher level of participation in the work force and to permit a greater utilization of the skills, talents and abilities of all citizens who want to work. 
230.215(1)(d) (d) That it is the intent of the legislature that all agencies of state government participate in developing and creating flexible-time work schedules, additional permanent part-time positions and other alternative work patterns in order to maximize, in a manner consistent with the needs of state service, the employment options available to existing and potential state employees. 
230.215(1)(e) (e) That it is the intent of the legislature that all agencies of state government make available permanent part-time employment opportunities in classified positions. 
230.215(2) (2) Flexible-time employment scheduling. In this subsection ""flexible-time schedule"" means a work schedule which includes required days or hours during which an employee subject to the work schedule must be present for work and designated hours during which the employee, with the approval of his or her supervisor, may elect a time of arrival to and departure from work. Every agency shall develop a plan for the establishment of employee flexible-time schedules.
