The new contract allows to do several important things. The first is all of our waste is not being processed in a MRF prior to being sent to the landfill, allowing us to pick out ~30% of the material and recycle it. The second is that since each bin will be weighed during pickup, we can be smarter about how we schedule our bin pickups. The third is we are now having campus wide waste audits being performed every semester to help identify our waste stream and make changes. The fourth is the ability to see and track the data live at a publicly accessible website (csun.wastetracking.com). With all of these changes our new diversion rate has increased to +/-60%.

1. Sac State Sustainability: University program that helps promotes sustainability on campus. Recycling, a component of Sac State Sustainability, maintains the operational standards of waste diversion at Sac State.
2. Take-Back Program: This award-winning program sought to open up free recycling opportunities to both the campus community as well as the surrounding communities. At the direction of the Recycling Coordinator, this program opened up all streams for which the University either gained monetarily or was able to recycle at no cost to the University. This program, which piggybacked the campus' recycling efforts, also allowed for waste diversion beyond the constraints of the campus. Streams that were part of this program include, but were not limited to: electronic waste, polystyrene foam, car batteries, etc. At its peak, this program averaged about 900 pounds of e-waste alone every month.
3. Tailgate Recycling: This program invites the students of the University to join with Sac State Recycling to capture CRV materials from tailgate events at home football games. The Fall of 2015 saw the advent of compost collection as part of these events.
4. Procurement Public Auction: Procurement operates a public auction of all materials deemed by Property to be of operating condition but of no further use to the University. These auctions can include any type of equipment, up to and including vehicles, forklifts, etc.
5. Trash Can Reduction: In an effort to remind the campus community that most items are recyclable, Sac State Recycling is removing unnecessary external trash cans from the campus. Furthermore, in a joint effort with Custodial Services, Recycling is switching desk side trash receptacles to a smaller 1.75 gallon mini-trash bin.
6. Food Composting: As opportunities avail themselves, pre and post-consumer food items from campus eateries, coffeehouses, etc., are being composted through various methods including vermicomposting, biodigesters, etc.
7. Green Waste Composting: The campus has created a temporary facility to house its burgeoning Green Waste Compost program, where green waste items can be composted to create mulch that will be used for campus greenery efforts. A permanent facility to exercise this program is in the planning stages. Prior to this temporary facility, the University's green waste was processed at a local co-gen plant to create energy.
8. C&D Diversion: The University's Planning Department requires at least 50% diversion from landfills of all capital construction projects occurring on campus.
9. Refuel Your Fun: Peak Adventures, a campus institution that allows students to join backpacking trips, get bikes serviced, etc., has begun a program in conjunction with California Product Stewardship Council (CPSC), in which personal-sized propane tanks can be rented or refilled, reducing the need of further purchase of these tanks.
10. Don't Rush to Flush: In another joint venture with CPSC, and through a grant from the Rose Foundation, the University was given a secure bin to collect unused or expired medication, including pet meds. These medications are collected for incineration, preventing the introduction of said medications to the water stream via flushing.
11. Department Recycling Days: This program was created to help departments declutter their offices (and homes) in a sustainable manner. Working together, a department representative and the Recycling Coordinator worked in advance to promote to the department members all of the office and personal items that would be accepted for recycling and on which day the event would be. On the day of the event, the Recycling Team would then come and pick-up, weigh, and otherwise document the materials before delivering them to their respective holding areas for recycling.

Policies:
1. The university's Recycling Program is based in part on requirements set forth by CA Assembly Bills 75, 341, and 1826. 
2. ""Procedures for the Safeguarding and Disposal of State Property"" is the official university policy regarding the determination of materials to be reused, recycled, or auctioned. This policy is based in part on ICSUAM Policies: 3150.01 – Administration of University Property & 3151.04 – Equipment.
3. It is the practice of Sac State to conduct businesses of recycling and other forms of diversion with CalRecycle-approved vendors deemed to satisfactorily recycle and/or otherwise divert materials in a safe and sustainable manner.

Infrastructure Investments:
1. Temporary compost yard - The University has temporarily converted a portion of its spoils yard into a green waste composting facility. 
2. Sustainable Technologies Optimization Research Center (STORC) - STORC has, through its programs including vermicomposting and biodiesel production, captured various pre-consumer streams from campus eateries and coffeehouses. The Center houses the facilities of these programs.
3. Waste compactors - The university employs the use of several recycling compactors, including one 20-yard food compactor.

Outreach:
1. Online - Sac State Recycling maintains a heavy presence on its social media accounts, including Facebook and Instagram, as well as on the university's official social media accounts, regularly reaching thousands of viewers each week. When reposted on the University's main social media account, the message of recycling has its best opportunity to reach most of the 28,500+ students at Sac State. A list of the types of materials that can be recycled can also be found on the Sac State Sustainability website.
2. Recycle It All Day - An event typically occurring in both Fall and Spring semesters invites the campus community to bring in various approved materials for recycling. In the past, these approved streams have included e-waste, batteries, light bulbs, clothes hangers, etc.
3. Sac State Sustainability typically tables at University events such as Rush Week and the WELL's WELLcome Back event.
4. Sac State Sustainability conducts its annual Earth Day event each April, where recycling and waste diversion play significant roles--once even collecting 7000 pounds of recyclable materials.
5. Sac State Sustainability volunteers act as docents at events such as Tailgate Reycling and Housing Move In/Out events, instructing event attendees of the various recycling opportunities available at Sac State.
6. Housing's RA Training - Each Fall, new Resident Advisors in the university's Housing department are instructed on University recycling opportunities so that they may in turn instruct students living in their dorms.
7. Graphics - Numerous graphics have been created through the years to illustrate opportunities for recycling. These graphics have been tailored to the department, event, or program which is promoting recycling. These graphics have been created as inforgraphics, posters, and even stickers, and are displayed throughout the campus.
8. At the invitation of faculty and/or program advisors, the Recycling Coordinator has participated in speaking engagements to promote recycling opportunities at Sac State as well as the university's efforts at waste diversion.
9. To better promote the Sac State Recycling program, Sac State Recycling has submitted for awards and has been the recipient of the CPSC Infinity Arrow Award, the only school in CA (Kindergarten through University Level) to have won in the last six years.
10. Recyclemania and Game Day Recycling: These are Retrac programs available through Keep America Beautiful and are competitions designed to promote recycling specifically to college students.","At the writing of this response there are no food donation programs currently employed by the University. However, this has been noted and we have begun to address the issue.","1. Beginning in March 2014, the Recycling Department began to collect used coffee grounds from the University's coffee houses. This program was then turned over to students working at the Sustainable Technologies Optimization Research Center (STORC) to be used in their composting program.
2. Also beginning in 2014, students from STORC began collecting pre-consumer food stuffs from various campus eateries and also from the University's Children's Center which created the stream when making snacks for their students. Much of this material was taken to the STORC for composting as part of the students' vermicomposting program.
3. Cooking oils collected in the University's Consumer Sciences Department are collected for use at STORC and processed into a form of bio-fuel. This bio-fuel has, in part, been added to the Facilities Management's diesel supply for state vehicles.
4. Cooking oils collected by Dining Services from the campus eateries are recycled in one of two ways. If the oil is relatively clean and there is a need for significant volume, then whatever can go to STORC does so as is processed much as described in #3. The rest of the oil is collected in bins by a local rendering company and is processed off-site.",1. Currently all the post consumer product is collected from the University's Dining Commons and shipped via the University's waste hauler to a local bio digester facility. This facility is known as Clean World and captures the methane and other gases from the composting process and infuses them with natural gas to create a bio compacted natural gas product. It is this final product which is used for fuel for the University's Hornet Bus program--six buses fueled by bio CNG gas which serve as free mass transportation for the students of this university. This is a newer program and in its first semester we were able to divert 26.49 tons from the landfill!,**,True,--,--,True,True,True,--,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,"Car Batteries

There are many programs, policies, and outreach efforts that are used to minimize the amount of waste that is disposed of on our campus.  
Recycling is at the forefront of our operation to minimize the waste that is disposed of at the university.  Recycling is available in every building on campus, outdoor areas, in residence halls, and at on-campus events.  The comingle recyclables are collected in a single-stream form and are ultimately separated at the Horry County MRF.  Ink cartridges, batteries, and techno-trash are recycled from our buildings daily.  Most buildings are equipped with a techno-trash bin that makes it stress-free for recycling those materials.  Below is a list of the items that can be recycled in any of our buildings. 
•	Mixed Paper - Newspaper, Magazines, Paper (shredded paper must be in clear bags), Junk Mail, Catalogs, Phone Books
•	Cardboard - Corrugated Cardboard, Pizza Boxes, Snack Boxes, Cereal Boxes
•	Plastic Bottles & Jugs
•	Metal & Aluminum Cans
•	Glass Bottles & Jars
•	Empty Ink Cartridges (all sizes, brands, including toners)
•	Used Batteries (alkaline, lead-acid)
•	Techno Trash (used ink cartridges, computers, computer parts and accessories, cell phones, CD's, floppy disks, VHS tapes)
Composting of both pre-consumer food waste and yard waste is done here at Coastal Carolina University.  We have a compost pile that is located near the Greenhouse on campus.  Pre-consumer food waste is picked up daily and taken to the compost pile where it is mixed with shredded yard debris that is collected from campus.  We also keep a 30 yard container that is exclusively for collecting yard waste that can be composted at the local landfill.

Special recycling efforts are made during on-campus events such as football games, basketball games, baseball games, triathlons, etc.   With football games being the biggest opportunity to divert waste we make recycling efforts very visible during these games.  Tailgating bags are handed out before the game for recyclables, recycling bins are placed in very high volume tailgating sections, bins are placed in suite areas, and the stadium recyclables are gathered after the game.  
Move- In and Move-Out at a university can create massive amounts of waste.  We have programs in place for both of these to minimize waste and give back to the local community.
During Move-Out in the Spring semester, the Campus Salvage Program sets out PODS across campus to accept unwanted items from students, staff and faculty at the end of the school year. More than half of the items we collect are donated to local organizations in need. The rest is sold at a community sale to pay for the costs to place the PODS on campus and help provide funding to the CCU Student Green Fund.  
During Move-In each August a full team of staff and volunteers capture a vast majority of the cardboard that is used for moving.  Small satellite stations and large roll-off containers are strategically placed across campus for students and their parents to drop off cardboard.
",Non-perishable food is collected from students during our “Campus Salvage” program.  This program is conducted when students are moving out at the end of each spring semester.  Students can donate their food at one of the many POD locations that are set up across campus. The food is then taken to local charities by members of the sustainability department. ,"Pre-Consumer food waste is gathered and placed in plastic roll cart containers outside of the food preparation buildings on campus.  We have a total of three containers that contain approximately fifty pounds of food scraps each.  The containers are then picked up daily and taken to a compost pile located on campus. The food scraps are mixed with yard debris that is mulched to build the compost pile.  The compost is then used by employees of the university who work in the facilities area once ready for use.

This enclosed, 30‐yard capacity compost bin is located on the CSU Foothills Campus (three miles west of main campus). Pre-consumer and post-consumer food waste from CSU  Dining  Centers is composted in the  Earth Flow.  The Earth Flow accepts up to 2,000 pounds of material per day.  Organic  waste is loaded  into one  end of  the vessel by placing  the collection container  on an  automated tipper. Every  time food  waste  is added, bulking material like straw, wood chips, and horse manure from the equine center is added at a 1:2 ratio.  Material is composted for about four to six weeks inside the vessel. Finished compost is discharged through an end door of the vessel. The compost is piled on site to cure for at least 3-4 weeks before being used in landscaping projects on campus such as Braiden Hall and The Durrell Center renovations. Over 30 yards of compost were used on these projects as a soil amendment.

In 2013, the CSU Earth Flow Composter diverted over 300,000 pounds of food waste from the landfill. In the first half of 2014, CSU composted over 100,000 pounds of material.

Waste prevention and recycling are important initiatives because they can help mitigate climate change. Landfills release greenhouse gases over time, and any form of source reduction or waste diversion mitigates the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling is a particularly effective method of waste disposal because material reprocessing requires less energy use than original processing.

Collection Methods
The New York City Department of Sanitation (DOS) picks up the majority of Columbia’s waste and recycling through a collection system on the Morningside Campus. All buildings within the Morningside Campus enclosure bring waste, plastic, glass, metal, paper, and some cardboard to a centralized location where the DOS picks it up for free. The City does not measure the amount that they pick up, so Columbia University only has records of private collection for waste and recycling on campus.

In 2009, the University changed the way in which ‘sharps’ waste was collected, replacing single-use containers with re-usable containers.  When full, these containers are robotically emptied, sanitized and reused.  A single container may be used as many as 500 times. 

In fiscal year 2013, about 15,725* lbs. of glassware, over 174,828 lbs. of electronics, 8,237 lbs. of batteries, 487 gallons of solvents, and 20,926 lbs. of light bulbs/lamps were recycled.  Surplus Reuse when possible is used on campus or alternatively, items no longer needed or in use are given to schools or local non-profit organizations with priority to organizations affiliated with Columbia Community Service. Whatever remains unclaimed goes to the Build It Green, NYC Waste Match program, which includes non-profits in the other four boroughs. Columbia also partners with the Institutional Recycling Network (IRN) where  changed out dorm furniture and used equipment – like kitchen equipment is given.  In the past equipment has gone to several countries in the Caribbean and to disaster relief in Haiti.  More information is on the housing, dining and environment.columbia.edu website.

Additionally, the Work/Life bulletin board, similar to an internal Craigslist, allows Columbia staff, faculty, and students  to post personal household and office items to buy, sell, swap or reuse. http://worklife.columbia.edu/forum

The undergraduate EcoRep program partners with Facilities and Housing for Give and Go Green and Facilities hosts Clean and Go Green.

(*This is the amount that Columbia Environmental Health and Safety sends out through the Chemtracker program.  This number does not reflect lab glass sent to the Department of Sanitation NY).
","John Jay Dining Hall, Ferris Booth Commons, Faculty House, and Catering Services donate excess food and leftovers to City Harvest, the city supplier for food banks.  Typically Columbia donates about 300 pounds a week of starches, vegetables, and sometimes meat.  Smaller quantities are donated to a local homeless shelter, Broadway Community.  In addition to food, Dining Services and University Events donate surplus kitchen equipment, including pots, pans, China, and larger restaurant equipment through the Institutional Recycling Network (IRN).

Columbia Dining also works with Columbia Community Impact Food Pantry.  Every Friday, volunteers cook a meal for 75-100 homeless and low-income guests.  Columbia Dining donates packaged items so that people who visit can go “grocery shopping.”   

Lastly, the spring move-out donation drive, Give + Go Green, accepts canned goods which it also donates to food banks and local charities.   Various food drives are conducted through the year, particularly in the holiday season.

In July of 2010 the recycling operation, historically a function of the Grounds Department, became an independent unit in Facilities Operations. This department is “R5 Operations;” the five R's representing Respect, Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. 

R5 Operations oversees the recycle streams for paper, cardboard, glass, tin, plastic, toners and ink cartridges, CD’s, computers and electronics, waste oil, scrap metal, wood, tires, and refrigerated units. R5 Operations is also working to improve reuse efforts for office supplies, furniture, and other items.

A core purpose for R5 Operations is a commitment to community engagement. In the 2012 they had a presence at new student orientations, hosted an open house, facilitated Cornell’s second year of participation in Recyclemania, celebrated America Recycles Day, hosted an electronic scrap collection event, and tabled a number of events.
Teaming with departments is a key to growing success. Cornell’s Building Care and R5 Operations are worked jointly to transition the campus to a single stream recycling system in the fall of 2011. Cornell’s Campus Mail and R5 Operations work together to offer a battery/CD/toner cartridge collection program with over 100 collection points . More team projects are on the way.

Recyclemania 2012 was Cornell’s second year in the game, and proved to be a wonderful opportunity for collaboration with broad support from student groups representing all undergraduate classes and many graduate programs. Departments all over the campus worked not only to recycle and compost, but to help boost school spirit through communications and event support.

R5 Operations is only one unit working with waste. Positive impacts on the university’s waste stream are broad. To mention only a few efforts: the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) operate the on-campus composting program; initiatives in Cornell Dining reduce food waste through improved preparation practices; policies on LEED certified construction reduce landfill waste; and reduction of printing and paper use in many departments impact the overall waste stream; the Cornell Waste Management Institute serves the campus and the public through research, outreach, training, and technical assistance, with a focus on organic residuals.","Cornell Dining regularly donates produce and dairy products to the Food Bank of the Southern Tier which services 7 counties in the region. Cornell Dining also works with the Food Recovery Network to donate prepared, perishable food to Loaves and Fishes and other food banks in the Finger Lakes Region.

Cornell University Farms and the Cornell University Orchards donate large amounts of food. However, as this food is grown outside of the STARS institutional boundary the tonnages are not included in the waste diversion metrics.
Most of Cornell's donated produce from University farms is grown off-campus, predominately at the Freeville Farm and now exceed well over 1-million pounds (article on this program at http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/10/volunteers-harvest-spuds-food-bank). Donations from our “on campus” farm locations are minimal as the crops are more agronomic (corn-soybean-wheat) and less fresh market in nature.
Additionally, donations are made from the Cornell Orchards. While some of the food is grown within the Cornell STARS boundary, most is grown at the Geneva, NY campus. In the 2013-14 academic year the Orchards donated 407.3 bushels of apples and 103.5 gallons of cider, 8 quarts of plums, 8 quarts of donut peaches, 139.39 lbs. of peaches and 1 bushel of pears.","All of Cornell Dining’s pre-consumer food waste is collected in every Dining unit and composted by one of the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station (CUAES) farms, Farm Services. Pre-consumer composting includes all food waste and compostable paper and plant-based products being composted during preparation and cooking before being served to customers, including all produce, dairy, meat trim loss, and any other food products that would not be eaten or salvaged. ","The University’s compost facility is operated by CUAES Farm Services. Farm services collects about 837 tons of food scraps and other compostables from 15 dining hall on campus. 

Farm Services handles 57 waste streams across campus and composts about 7406 tons of waste annually. In addition to food waste composting, 6377 tons of animal manure and bedding from the School of Veterinary Medicine, the Cornell Dairy program and other animal facilities on campus, and 217 tons of plant material and soil from greenhouses and other plant growth operations on campus are composted at the facility.

These units manage solid waste and sustainability efforts at Duke while providing support for university-wide special events and routine preventative maintenance of sanitation and recycling equipment. Sanitation and Recycling also manage a composting operation to turn landscaping material into useable top soil. Taking care of the environment is an important role of Facilities Management. Through Duke Recycles, Duke traditional recyclables like magazines or aluminum from the Durham landfill every year, including many non-traditional recyclables, such as food compost, motor oil and tires. Duke Recycles collects more than 1,500 bins that contain anything from paper to glass to packing peanuts. Since 1989, Duke Recycles has offered numerous services to help create a more sustainable campus by emphasizing student and faculty and staff participation. Recycling locations can be found outside many residence halls, in Central Campus laundry areas and in university common areas. Students also have a small bucket in their rooms to collect items to carry to the nearest drop-off location. The Duke Surplus Property Program helps to divert tons of unnecessary waste from the landfill every year. All Duke-purchased property including furniture, electronics, medical equipment and supplies are collected daily and staged for donation to local non-profits and Duke Departments. Data-containing electronic items are wiped to meet Department of Defense standards, and are then primarily donated to our local school system as well as other non-profits. This donation-only business model helps to eliminate unnecessary purchases and the resources required to sell surplus property. This “no-sell” model began in 2007.","During shutdown periods, perishable items are donated to a local food bank. The groups that receive donations include Soup Kitchen, Caring House, Durham Rescue Mission, and Urban Ministries. Duke also engages in large scale donations to Urban Ministries before holidays and during student breaks to feed the local community in Durham.  As of 2013, four large scale donations had occurred from Duke dining services to Urban Ministries, and the university hopes to increase the frequency of these donations of food waste to the community in the future.","Bon Appétit composts pre-consumer waste in all of the facilities on Duke University's campus.

Emory Recycles program supports waste management on Emory University’s campus and satellite locations and Emory Healthcare’s Clifton Road Clinics by collecting recyclables for recycling.  Recycling containers are located in residence halls and classrooms for student recycling; offices, clinics and labs for faculty and staff recycling and compost collections.  In 1998, a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) was built on campus. With the addition of the MRF, Emory Recycles is able to extend services to surrounding organizations.  Currently, Emory Recycles provides recycling service for the Carter Center, the CDC, neighboring apartment complexes and neighboring retirement homes.   Program commodities include glass, paper, aluminum, cardboard, e-waste, construction and demolition waste, scrap metal, and most recently, food waste and animal bedding.   In fiscal year 2013, the program recovered 2069 tons of material for recycling, 656 tons of material for composting, diverting 40 percent of University waste.  Since the inception of a food waste and animal bedding composting program in October of 2009, the program’s diversion rate has increased by 15 percent.   The composting program at Emory is a closed loop system whereby food and wood waste are composted and returned to the university as a soil amendment used for capital projects, semi-annual plantings, and in Emory’s sustainable gardens.

GW commits to becoming a Zero Waste campus in the long-term, and aims to increase recycling to 50% by 2017 and to reduce litter on campus. Tactics proposed to achieve these goals include: expanding composting, updating and expanding recycling and waste infrastructure on campus, piloting new technologies, exploring new vendor options and increasing education and awareness. 

GW has a comprehensive waste diversion program that includes recycling of containers, paper, cardboard, construction materials, e-waste as well as reuse of furniture. GW runs a composting program in Pelham Commons at the Mount Vernon Campus and the J-Street Cafeteria at Foggy Bottom.

GW is aware that a serious amount of plastic waste is caused by disposable water bottles. That’s why the university is working to reduce the number of disposable water bottles purchased by GW. In 2014, the Office of Sustainability again provided durable, reusable water bottles to 2,400 students for the annual Freshman Day of Service event. The Office has also worked with internal and external caterers to eliminate disposable water bottles at event and instead provide refillable water coolers.

In addition, GW will build on its successful Green Move Out program - an annual event that takes place when students leave the campus for the summer. Last year, Green Move-Out collected over 20 tons of clothing, shoes, and household items to be distributed or donated to local community organizations. Part of this effort also includes non-perishable food donations and books - both of which are donated to a local food bank and literacy program, respectively.

The Green Office Network is the primary faculty and staff sustainability engagement program. The Office of Sustainability facilitates a conversation and better practices amongst the university faculty and staff. The purpose is to improve awareness, build community and empower staff to make positive, healthy changes, including on waste diversion.

GW participates in Recyclemania, a national program that promotes waste reduction on college campuses by universities competing against one another to reduce waste, and increase recycling and composting. As part of this competition at GW, students conduct an annual waste sort to increase awareness of Recyclemania. Trash collected on campus is spread across a public site on campus, and students sort the trash and remove recycling. ","On April 5, 2013, student member and volunteers for the GW chapter Food Recovery Network (FRN) collected their first prepared food donation from a Sodexo-managed kitchen in our J-Street food complex. Since that time, the FRN has collected and donated foods from additional events outside of GW's Sodexo dining venues.

As part of the national Food Day celebration, the Office of Sustainability partnered with the GW Urban Food Task Force and many other key stakeholders to donate fresh produce to one of the District's lowest-income communities. GW students, staff, and faculty came together to distribute enough produce to close to 100 families and senior citizens. The food donations came through Sodexo, the Washington Youth Garden, and the GW Student Community Grow Garden. ","Gw's Mount Vernon Campus dining hall has participated in pre-consumer food waste collection for about five years. Beginning in the fall of 2014, the pre-consumer food waste collection program was expanded to include the JStreet dining hall at the GW Foggy Bottom Campus. JStreet Dining is the main dining facility for the university and serves hundreds of students daily.","GW composts at designated events, usually in collaboration with the Office of Sustainability. At roughly ten events per year composting is available. These include large catered events and sporting concessions. 

As part of GW's Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy, GW began piloting post-consumer composting at the Pelham Commons dining facility in the spring semester of 2013. GW is collaborating with Sodexo and student organizations to provide the necessary training and education to ensure that staff and students are effectively composting.

In addition to these programs, the College also diverts waste from biomass ash, plastic bags, white goods, lab equipment, furniture, cooking oil, metal, construction and demolition projects and other miscellaneous items.

GMC Recycling Program:
The GMC recycling program is directed by the sustainability office. Six waste crew members are responsible for collection of all recyclable items from indoor and outdoor receptacles and then delivery of those items to the central recycling trailer, where it is later picked up by the waste company, Casella. The delivery mechanism is a human-powered bicycle trailer. The recycling crew schedule is coordinated by the sustainability office manager (a student position). Recycling bins and bicycle trailers are purchased with support from the Student Campus Greening Fund on an as-needed basis. The recycling crew also helps the reuse manager collect material from e-waste collection boxes.

Green Move Out and Green Move In:
Each May, the Green Move Out program at GMC diverts reusable items from the landfill that students dispose of when moving out of the residence halls. A team of over ten volunteers (including sustainability office work study students, and other students) works during the last week of finals through the day after commencement on this project. Signs and emails advertise the event in the residence halls the week before students begin to vacate the campus for the summer break. Students are encouraged to bring unbroken, working and pre-owned items to designated areas in the first floor lounges of their residence halls.

Many students also leave a number of items in the hubs of each floor (where recycling bins and compost bins are located). The GreenMove Out Team moves usable items that could be donated/saved down to the lounges during the week of move-out. “Lounge shopping” is advertised among the campus community during the week prior to graduation. Most undergraduates move out during this week. A
number of faculty, staff and other students take advantage of this opportunity to take unwanted items. Hundreds of pounds of clothing, furnishing, bedding, appliances, etc. are taken to new homes. 

Before Commencement, the Green Move Out Team bags up unwanted clothes and bedding and donates them to local charities such as the Poultney thrift store, the Rutland Women’s Shelter, Salvation Army and the Rutland Area Humane Society (all items go through quality control to ensure cleanliness and usability). Non-perishable food items are donated to the Poultney Food Shelf.

Other reusable items are placed in storage closets, the Freepo, and the Free Store to be given away/sold to new students in the fall. Volunteers are allowed to move back into the residence halls a few days early to help facilitate this Green Move-In Sale during orientation. E-waste is also collected, stored in IT offices and recycled. This project is sponsored by the Sustainability Office in collaboration with the Office of Residence Life. The effort regularly diverts over 5,000 lbs of reusable material. In 2015, it was 5,714 lbs.

Freestore and Freepo (Reuse stores):
A reuse manager working out of the sustainability office maintains the College’s Freestore and Freepo throughout the year. The Freestore, located in the student center, consists of appliances, clothes, books, and other items diverted from the waste stream via “free boxes” in the residence halls. Any student, staff or faculty member can take what they want from the store. The Freepo, located in the main administrative building, is a similar concept, with a focus on office supplies that are salvaged from campus offices and student donations.

The GMC Compost Program:
This program is directed by the sustainability office in collaboration with Cerridwen Farm. The six-member waste crew is responsible for daily collection of compostable food scraps from the kitchen/dining hall and transportation of this material to Cerridwen Farm on campus. In September 2015 the Professional custodial staff assist the student waste crew with collecting residence hall food waste. The custodial staff removes compost at the collection point on each floor via compostable bags. The student waste crew staff collects the food waste at each building and adds it to our general food waste collection that is processed each night with our kitchen/dining hall.  The sustainability office engages in educational outreach to promote a culture of ownership over the program among residents.

E-waste Collection Program:
The sustainability office collaborates with the IT department to collect e-waste from e-waste bins situated in every major building. The e-waste is stored in a vault room in the library and is then recycled every year using a certified e-waste company. The annual e-waste pick-up is carried out during Earth Week and streamlined with a public collection event. Volunteers sit in the student center with a large sign and collect e-waste on the spot, and also answer questions about the topic.
","Typically, at the end of a semester or prior to breaks, dining services donates any perishable food items with a limited shelf life to the Poultney Food Shelf. Additionally, every May the sustainability office's green move out team donates non-perishable items that the students leave behind to the Poultney Food Shelf. Sustainability staff began collaborating with local community organizations and the food recovery network in the fall of 2015 to develop a process for developing a system for donating prepared food that isn’t served to be provided to people in need in the Poultney community. ","The pre-consumer compost program is managed by the sustainability office. Pre-consumer food waste is deposited into compost buckets by Chartwell’s dining hall staff members. These food scraps are collected every evening by members of the sustainability office’s work-study compost crew. In the Fall of 2015, the sustainability office began weighing pre-consumer waste on its own to gain data specific to pre-consumer waste. 
","The post-consumer compost program is also managed by the sustainability office. The waste diversion crew is responsible for daily collection of post-consumer food scraps from the dining hall and transporting it to Cerridwen Farm on campus to be processed in the windrow system. All post-consumer food scraps are weighed and reported to the sustainability office daily. 

Campus-wide compost collection is managed jointly by the sustainability office and the custodial staff managed by CW. A compost bin is located on every floor of residence halls. There are also compost collection bins located in the majority of all other buildings on campus. The compost bins are part of a 3-bin units that were student built with reused items such as dining hall trays and dresser drawers. The custodial crew monitors the compost bins and removes the food waste for outside pickup by the student waste crew to deliver to our windrow system. . 

Finished compost that has been processed on the farm is primarily used by the farm to fertilize vegetable plots and helps produce beautiful vegetables for the campus dining hall, Poultney Farmers’ Market, and CSA shares that are sold to members of the College and surrounding community.

Metal is recycled by facilities (an estimated weight counts toward waste diversion), as well as a large portion of the wood (which is not weighed, estimated, nor counted toward diversion). Big items like furniture are donated to off-campus charity organizations through special trips whenever possible (an estimated weight of this is counted toward diversion). Refrigerators are collected and shipped to Casella for their metal recycling value. An estimated weight of this is counted toward diversion (based on weighing several, taking an average, and then applying it to the total count).

Uncontaminated ash from the biomass plant (an estimated 38.81 tons in FY 2015) is also diverted from the waste stream by being donated to a local farmer who spreads it on his fields to sweeten his soil. The decision to use the ash for this came from a research project in a chemistry class that weighed the costs and benefits of various options, including making soap, repairing forest soil, and using it for compost. The least energy intensive and most beneficial option was to use it as a soil sweetener for agriculture. Ash is counted toward waste diversion because it is also counted against waste diversion when it is landfilled. The ash that is cleaned out of the smokestack is contaminated with oil residue so it is landfilled through the waste company.

In addition, surplus materials are often donated to community and non-profit organizations. In Fiscal Year 2011 alone the surplus program donated over 2.5 million dollars worth of products to over 200 charities. Harvard also partners with the LABBB’s “School to Work” vocational training program to train autistic students of high school age to sort, refurbish and re-sell computers, clothing and books.","In FY15 Harvard University Dining Services alone donated 58,000 pounds of food, or 44,000 meals, through a partnership with a local food donation non-profit Food for Free.

Dining Services and Office of Sustainability report the pounds of food waste disposed of in our main dining hall out to campus to demonstrate how much food students are throwing away. All of this organic waste is composted.
Reusable Water Bottles: Since fall 2009, all incoming first years are given a free reusable water bottle. The water bottle is an indication to first years of the Colleges’ commitment to sustainability, but also a practical gift for students to use while on campus. The reusable water bottles significantly decrease the purchase and disposal of single use water and beverage containers. Additionally, all first year students receive one-on-one coaching on proper recycling, composting, and landfilling procedures and materials during Orientation.
Drink Local Campaign: Through the Carver and DeLaney Family Environmental Studies Endowment, two HWS students started the Drink Local campaign on campus fall 2013. The campaign resulted in the installation of nearly 10 new water bottle refill stations across campus, the distribution of over 150 Nalgene water bottles, a campus map identifying all refill stations, and a Facebook page to increase awareness.

MIT seeks to recognize the ecological and health impacts of its waste management decisions and aims to take into account the connection between materials that enter the campus and those that leave campus.

Through recycling, composting and conservation efforts, MIT has worked hard to reduce its overall waste disposal, which has saved money while reducing the Institute’s environmental footprint.  In 2013, MIT attained a 46 percent recycling rate. Read more about these efforts at the Department of Facilities website.

The Environment, Health and Safety Office at MIT provides guidance and support to the MIT community on the proper management of the Institute’s regulated waste. For more information on proper waste management, visit the EHS website here.

Reuse
Reuse is an important keystone of MIT’s waste reduction efforts.  The Institute has a number of programs in place for the community to find a second home for unneeded or unwanted items.

MIT ReUse is a service that allows MIT students, staff, faculty, and alumni to sell or exchange items.  This listserv community promotes waste minimization through the reuse of usable goods.   The Green Committee -- a committee of MIT's Working Group on Support Staff Issues -- operates an extensive list of MIT reuse programs and tips on ways to reduce waste. 

Choose to Reuse is held in the Stata Center (Building 32) every third Thursday of the month. MIT community members can donate and pick up free clean, reusable items for free. The event is organized by the staff Green Committee. Visit their website for more information.
Swapfest, held the third Sunday of every month, April through October, is a way to buy, sell, and swap electronic items. 

What Can Be Recycled at MIT?
The MIT recyclable waste stream is divided into over several categories: Batteries, Books, eWaste, Food Waste, Light Bulbs, Plastic Bags, Single Stream, TechnoCycle, Toner Cartridges, and White Goods. To find out how to recycle daily use items, see the list below.
MIT Recycling also manages recycling streams for yard waste, wood, metal, tires, and materials from construction and development.

By the middle of 2015, every building on the UP campus will have one or more möbius stations.  Custodial staff will no longer empty office trash cans.  Rather, employees will be responsible for sorting the contents of their personal bins at the möbius stations.  This is expected to enhance awareness, and shift custodial efforts from emptying personal bins to managing contents of the recycling/ composting bins. This initiative is expected to enable the University to divert 85% of the University's solid waste from the landfill.

Intercollegiate Athletics is part of the mobius initiative as well. The new Pegula Ice Arena has möbius stations.

","Any perishable food items are donated to Meals on Wheels prior to long semester breaks (winter and summer). The individual dining commons managers contacts Meals on Wheels to organize the pick-up. The amount of food each dining common is able to donate varies depending on the time of year and semester. 

A student club, Waste Not, primarily concerns itself with acquiring perishable, leftover food from dining halls on University Park campus and delivering it to care homes, hospices, and halfway houses in the State College area.
","Pre-consumer food is captured from the six on-campus dining commons, several outlets on campus such as the HUB and Bryce Jordan Center, as well as the hospitality centers (Nittany Lion Inn and Penn Stater) and catering service (Campus Catering). The hospitality employees source separate pre and post consumer food. Food service employees also source separate pre-consumer food. 

Since 1997 Penn State’s Organic Materials Processing and Education Center (OMPEC) has demonstrated continuous growth in quantity, quality and variety of organic materials captured, processed and utilized at the University Park Campus. The OMPEC site is operated as a captive facility. The primary inputs diverted from the waste stream are pre and post-consumer food residuals, leaves, landscape debris and lab animal cage wastes.  Farm animal manure and crop residues are used to compliment the various feedstocks to create an optimal compost mix and to produce value added end products demanded by users.

The OMPEC facility fulfills operational needs of the University, provides research opportunities and serves as a model facility for the public and private organics processing sector to observe and learn organics processing procedures.  Each year classes in Environmental Resource Management, Horticulture, Agro Ecology and Ag Engineering visit the site to learn about environmental design, production and equipment.  

The program was developed as a collaboration between the College of Agricultural Sciences, Housing and Food Services, Hospitality Services and the Office of Physical Plant. The project has parallel goals of responding to the needs of handling organic residuals generated from within the university and enhancing teaching, research and extension/outreach programs of a land-grant university.

SLU introduced single-stream recycling in the Fall of 2009, and since then has seen a steady increase in recycling on campus. However, as Saint Louis University progresses in the pursuit of creating a more sustainable campus environment, the need to develop a fresh comprehensive recycling plan became evident. To help make access to recycling easier and universal, Facilities obtained recycling receptacles for exterior use and placed them in strategic locations throughout campus during the fall of 2012.  In addition, Facilities developed numerous educational tools for single-stream recycling such as brochures, presentations, signage, and magnets. In the summer of FY15, one of the Sustainability & Benchmarking graduate assistants and two student workers completed the placement of signage on all interior recycling bins on all three St. Louis campuses. This helped to enhance the recycling program and provide more consistency in marketing the sustainability message. Ultimately, these improvements should help SLU single-stream recycling goal of 30%.","The Campus Kitchens Project is a student run service organization that turns unused food from campus cafeterias and grocery stores into nourishing meals for hungry members of the community.

Since 1990, Smith has expanded its recycling program to a robust campuswide system in every student house, public space and office.

Eco-Reps inform fellow housemates about the importance of recycling and composting and how to do so  properly on campus. During the 2013-2014 academic year, once a month they acted as ""compost fairies"" by dressing in fairy costumes to attract attention and standing by the compost buckets in dining halls to inform students as what can/cannot be composted.  Eco-Reps also host Sustainabili-Teas where they educate students about composting and recycling by playing Waste Bingo.

Smith collects pre and post-consumer compost at all 12 student dining areas, which diverts 215 tons of food waste each year from the landfill.  This, as well as 1200 tons of horse manure and bedding from our stables, are composted at a local farm.  

Food waste is also diverted through the efforts of the Smith chapter of the Food Recovery Network, a student organization.  These students work with chefs to package leftover food, and they deliver it to community kitchens in the area.  The FRN donates approximately 3,600 pounds of food each year.  

Programs to reduce bottled water consumption on campus have contributed to a significant reduction in bottles and cans recycling as there are now less single-use plastic bottles on campus. Bottled water is largely banned from being sold on campus and is only available at retail locations and vending machines.

In managing its surplus property, Smith has a preference for re-use over recycling and donates materials via the Institutional Recycling Network (IRN).  These materials include clothing and electronic waste.

Recycling Nights are held prior to student move-out weekend each spring, where students are encouraged to clean out their rooms to promote better recycling during a busy time of year.  Facilities Managements sends a truck around the campus where students can bring their paper recycling and unwanted clothing, in exchange for a coupon for the Campus Center Cafe.  Between this and other efforts, we collect 12 tons of clothing for donation and reuse each year.

Over 5000 carefully-signed recycling bins are in place on campus including in each building, all residence halls, and numerous outdoor gathering points. Food waste is collected from all dining halls, cafes, and housing areas. Stanford established a special event recycling and composting program. Yard trimmings are collected from the Grounds Department. Numerous outreach and educational opportunities are provided to all stakeholders on campus. Staff work with students on special projects and Stanford has participated in the nationwide RecycleMania competition each year since 2007.

Stanford bases new waste programs off of the 28 waste audits that have been performed. For example, Stanford identified that 17% of the material being sent to the landfill was paper, so the university established a uniform desk-side recycling program to be deployed across campus. After a pilot project in operations buildings, this program was fully launched in summer 2014. As of February 2016, over 7,500 sets of bins (each set includes one paper recycling bin and one mini trash can) have been deployed in a total of 82 buildings on campus. 

Secondly, Stanford continues its endeavors to make sure all recycling and composting bins are labeled uniformly. Stanford has re-labeled over half the bins on campus and will steadily continue to re-label the remaining bins. These labels clearly show what types of products should be put in which bins, and their consistency across campus will translate to higher levels of recognition among individuals and, in turn, improved individual recycling habits. 

Additionally, Stanford has recently expanded its composting program, since waste audits have shown that organic waste comprises 31% of material sent to the landfill. For instance, Student Housing has expanded its paper towel composting program and has formal plans to make some of their residences Zero Waste. This program was rolled out in 2015 and began with several of the high-profile row houses. Also in 2015, Stanford launched an interior composting program for the first time, where Stanford's waste management contractor will set up and service compost bins inside academic buildings at a minor cost to each department. As of February 2016, 50 buildings are participating in this program, and the waste composted through this program increased from 1,140 pounds in July 2015 to 2,560 pounds in November 2015. The university also operates a voluntary composting program and continues to strategically add shared compost dumpsters across campus to make it easier for building occupants to discard organic waste from the small compost bins that they individually maintain.

If each person puts less food on their plate they do not eat, less food is wasted.  Also, less food is then produced as the kitchen is not replenishing the taken food.  Dining facilities also implemented a tool where they weighed post-consumer waste in the dish room and posted the weight of food thrown away each night to create a ‘challenge’ for the community diners to reduce the number.

Beginning in the fall of 2014, office recycling and trash collection has changed to the ""trash buddy"" system.  Each office or cubicle is equipped with a desk-side recycling bin and a small hanging waste basket known as the trash buddy.  Office occupants are expected to empty their trash buddies into central waste stations.  The custodians empty recycling from employee’s desks once each week.  Central waste stations are serviced daily.  

Students receive bins for their dorm rooms. We participate in RecycleMania. Recycling and trash weights are tracked. Periodic waste sorts and bin inspections allow us to monitor our progress. New students receive recycling information when they matriculate. Every floor of every dorm has central recycling stations with instructions posted. New employees receive recycling instructions during their employee orientation. Every shift (1st, 2nd, 3rd & weekend) of custodians on each campus receives an annual recycling review and retraining. Most student publications include a ""recycle me"" logo, including The Daily newspaper. We have a large move-out recycling program where we collect electronics, carpets, food, clothing, paper, and commingled recyclables. We have abundant outdoor recycling bins in our greenspaces. We have extensive battery recycling receptacles. We have a shoe/sneaker recycling bin in the athletics center. Our largest science complex recycles Styrofoam coolers and plastic bags.  We have an interactive reverse vending machine on campus that is meant to attract fraternities and offers potentially uninterested or unmotivated students a financial incentive to recycle. ","Collection boxes for unopened food are placed in residence halls during spring move-out.  Donated food is brought to a local food pantry.

An undergraduate student community service club, the Leonard Carmichael Society, has a group called ""Food Rescue"" that works with Dining services and area businesses to donate left-over but unserved food to local food pantries and shelters. More info at http://sites.tufts.edu/tuftslcs/programs/food-rescue/   For large campus events such as Commencement we donate un-served food to the Veteran's Homeless Shelter in Boston.","On the Medford/Somerville campus, pre-consumer food waste is composted in six out of eight eateries.  We do not have a breakdown of our food waste composting totals by pre or post, but the total tonnage of food waste composted in 2013 was 325 tons.  In 2014, 306 tons of food waste was composted. ","Post-consumer waste is composted in three out of eight dining facilities, and we have fifteen central collection bins where any member of Tufts community can bring food scraps from their kitchens or special events.  

Student ""Eco-Reps"" manage compost bins in all staffed dorms where residents can deposit vegetable and compostable paper waste. Students living in unstaffed dorms and employees can collect their own compost (no animal products) and deposit them in one of the many ""public"" compost bins located around the campus. 

Many events on the Medford/Somerville and Grafton campuses now have post-consumer composting bins available, including the undergraduate matriculation lunch and dinner and the commencement luncheon located on the Medford/Somerville campus.

The Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine composts animal bedding.

The slurry and composted bedding are spread on the farm fields as fertilizer, preventing their disposal in the solid or liquid waste stream.

Clothing is collected and distributed for free during annual student-run clothing swaps at the Medford/Somerville and Grafton campuses. 

Various student-led initiatives have collected plastic grocery bags for recycling and clothing for donation during the year (separate from move-out). A resident of the Green House collected simple dorm supplies from move-out in 2014 and 'freecycled' them to the incoming students in the Fall.

Every year since 2005, the campus has been able to reduce the tons of material it sends to landfill. In 2015, UCI sent only 19% to landfill.  Since 2008 UCI has continued to decrease the amount of waste to landfill.  The campus recycles more than 22 commodities using a source-separation program for metal, wood, paper, pallets, cardboard, and recyclable beverage containers collected for their redemption value in the state of California. Every campus office and building has a paper and cardboard recycle program. All classrooms, laboratory buildings, pedestrian pathways, and student housing have a commingled recycle program in addition to the paper and cardboard recycle program. The commingled recycle program was started in 2009 in UC Irvine’s housing communities and expanded during 2012 to include laboratory buildings, campus restaurants, and classrooms. In the first year, 205 tons were diverted; the commingled program continues to grow and resulted in diverting 951.1 tons of recyclables in 2015. This program recycles all plastics, glass, paper, and metal using a two-bin system. 

UCI has food composting in all three of its dining commons and at 26 campus restaurants. The food composting program started in 2010 and collected 96 tons.  The food composting program continues to grow collecting 517 tons in 2013. UC Irvine was commended by the EPA for our food program and in 2013 received a visit from Bob Perciasepe, the second in command at the Washington DC Headquarters of the EPA.  All three of UC Irvine's dining commons -- Mesa, Pippin, and Brandywine -- operate full time at Zero Waste.  They are among five buildings on campus that are certified Zero Waste due to their 95% or higher diversion rate.  The Anteater Recreation Center and the Newkirk Alumni House and Conference Center are the newest facilities to operate with zero waste. UCI composts 100% of its green waste in a collaborative effort with a local off-site facility using traditional windrow composting. Campus food waste and animal bedding materials are sent to a local processing plan that converts the material into a bio-slurry. The slurry is transported to the local water treatment plant’s anaerobic digester. The resulting methane gas is converted to energy that powers the water treatment plant. Some recyclable material still finds its way into the waste stream; UCI delivers all non-recycled waste material to a local material recovery facility, which reclaims additional recyclables before the remainder goes to landfill.  

UCI's Solid Waste and Recycle team consists of 15 full-time employees and a fleet of 11 vehicles including electric and biodiesel fuel vehicles. The campus self-hauls all of its solid waste and recycling to ensure that it makes the greenest diversion choice for each commodity. The recycle team received monthly training and the custodial team receives annual training in recycling.  UCI also teaches about recycling through 25-plus presentations and workshops and 7 large-scale Zero Waste events held each year; these are geared toward staff, students, and visitors. UCI invites other colleges to visit and learn best demonstrated practices from its recycling program and, in turn, learns from visitors. The university hosted its first Sustainability Forum, “Creating a Culture of Environmental Stewardship,” targeted toward K-12 and higher education institution educators in 2012. In addition, UCI has 6 unpaid student interns working with the recycle team each year, doing resume-worthy projects and earning four college units for each 100 hours worked. In 2015 the team grew by 5 paid part-time student employees who all work on Zero Waste projects that will help prepare them for a career in sustainability. 

UC Irvine was awarded the ""Zero Waste Achievement Award"" by the California Resource Recovery Association in 2013.  Zero waste is within UCI's grasp, and the campus should meet this goal before the UC established deadline of 2020.  

In 2015 our student recycle team started a Styrofoam collection program that collects 60 cubic yards of Styrofoam each month from campus lab and medical buildings.  The material is taken to a local surfboard manufacturer (Marko). Marko has equipment to densify the Styrofoam and manufacture it to surfboard foam cores. We are working on a grant to purchase a UCI-owned densifyer. 
","UCI Dining works with The Food Donation Connection Network to donate excess, unserved foods to the local community. To ensure that a sustainable balance is made between preparing just the right amount of food and having a minimal amount left over, our knowledgeable food service managers forecast the amount of diners expected for each meal service. This estimate is based on dining traffic and food consumption trends.",All three campus dining commons and 23 campus restaurants have a pre-consumer food waste collection program. In the kitchens all pre-consumer food waste is placed in a food collection bin and added to the campus food composting program. Each dining facility has a bin dedicated for the collection of this material.  In 2015 the campus food composting program was responsible for keeping 667 tons of food scraps out of the landfill.,"The post-consumer food waste pilot program at Phoenix Grill was performed over a six-month period and completed in December 2013. The program uses a three-bin system (compost, recycle and landfill) both inside and outside, adjacent to the seating area. Bin signs utilize images and are placed at eye level. The Phoenix Grill pilot was so successful that Phoenix Gill was awarded  Zero Waste Certification because it operates full time at a 95% or higher diversion rate. This same post-consumer food-waste program is also currently in place at BC Cavern Food Court and at the East Food Court.   
The campus newest post consumer food waste program is in place in five of our student housing communities both dorm and apartment style.   Each kitchen has a 3-gallon or 6-gallon food compost bin.  Size of bin is based on the number of students living in each unit.   Since the student housing compost program started in 2015 food waste has increased by 67 tons.

In order to accomplish these goals UCLA engages in a rigorous recycling program. Recycled materials include CRV beverage containers, whitepaper, mixed paper and cardboard, newspaper, green waste, rock product, wood and metal, and computer toner cartridges. There are over 200 single-stream recycling bin sites throughout the campus which recycle paper, glass, aluminum, and plastics #1-9, as well as a desk-side recycling program which ensures that all offices on campus have single-stream recycling bins, with a ratio of 1:1 recycling bins to trash cans. Departments can request additional recycling bins online easily at the sustainability website. The website also features a comprehensive recycling FAQ list which aids students, faculty and staff in understanding both the importance of recycling and how to effectively recycle. 

In 2008, the UCLA Green Team was introduced, which is a group of volunteers who oversee recycling areas at large events to ensure maximum diversion. In the 2009-2010 school year, a UCLA Action Research Team (http://www.eslp-la.com/action-research-teams.html) worked with Facilities Management to conduct research on how to improve campus recycling which included updating maps with recycling bin locations and conducting a survey of students, faculty and staff regarding how to improve recycling on campus which resulted in more effective signage on all campus bins. Undergraduate On-Campus Housing composts food waste and food prep waste at four of its dining facilities. 

In addition to composting and recycling, UCLA also diverts waste through a waste-to-energy program with a plant located in an industrial section of the City of Commerce.

While waste to energy does use incineration in the process, it is different from traditional incineration in that combustion of materials is used to generate electricity.

In 2009, Request for Proposal (RFP) was written to solicit a vendor who could accept all recyclable items in a ""single stream"" method. Single Stream recycling is the term used for a system in which all recyclable items can be mixed together during the collection stage and then sorted off-site. Education, training and support by the potential vendor were a large part of the RFP. Two firms submitted proposals and QRS Inc. was chosen to become the University’s recycling vendor.

In this system, every office, classroom and common area has a container for mixed recyclables. Custodial staff is responsible for collecting the materials and placing them into the recycling dumpster. An eight yard, single stream recycling dumpster is placed by each garbage dumpster on all three of our campuses. Recycling dumpsters are emptied according to a schedule that is dictated by how often they are full. This may be daily in some cases and every two weeks in others. The recycling truck then takes the items to a Mixed Recycling Facility where items are separated by a mix of automation and manpower. Recyclables are then grouped by commodity and sold to processors.  

Garbage Reduction Program/Mini-Bin
Coupled with the recycling initiative is a garbage reduction program. This program consists of a desk-top garbage can that is called a ""Mini Bin.""  The Mini Bin is about one quart in size and includes a lid. The receptacle has a slogan on the side that reads ""This is all the GARBAGE I make!"" The university is in the process of replacing all seven to ten gallon sized desk-side garbage cans with the Mini Bin. The smaller desk-top can is for any items that cannot be recycled in the single stream system.  The idea being that most items that were considered trash now can be recycled. The small size of the Mini Bin causes one to think about what they are trying to dispose of and whether the item is recyclable. In the new program, each individual is responsible for emptying their Mini Bin container.

Electronics
Computer equipment is mostly re-purposed throughout the university or passed to university affiliates, such as the Scholar House, as long as it continues to be useful. Once equipment reaches ""end-of-life"" it is sold through the University Inventory Control department for recycling of materials.

Chemicals
Chemical purchases can often be reduced by borrowing and sharing chemicals between laboratories. Departments are encouraged to exchange chemicals whenever possible and utilize the excess supplies held by the Department of Environmental Health & Safety (DEHS). Not all the chemicals picked up by DEHS are a waste. Many are only partially used and have not exceeded their shelf life or been altered in any way. Others are unused and still in the original sealed container. In some cases, these chemicals can be used by someone else at the university. Reusable chemicals collected by DEHS are brought to the central accumulation area, recorded, segregated, and held for redistribution instead of disposal. Each chemical may be reviewed prior to acceptance. The person who receives the chemical is responsible to determine the suitability of the chemical for their use.

Materials Exchange
The Department of Purchasing (Surplus Division) maintains a website that allows authenticated campus users to post items that have a reuse value to the site and made available to any other campus user that could use the products for official university use. This site can be used for virtually any product. A recent category was created on this site specifically for the purpose of making available packaging materials received during the course of deliveries. The intent of the materials exchange is to increase the reuse of items and to divert the goods from the recycling dumpster or waste stream.

The Department of Housing & Residential Life organizes an annual campus-wide ""Swap Shop"" for the exchange of useful items in order to reduce the amount of materials sent to landfill during move-out times. Any unclaimed items are donated to charity.

Composting
The University of Louisville Grounds Maintenance Department utilizes selected green waste created from the care of the lawns, landscape and trees on Belknap campus to create compost/mulch. This includes chipped/shredded tree limbs, shrub trimmings and leaves. These items are ""tub ground"" once or twice per year in an effort to decrease their size and combine the materials. They are then put into piles based on their age and turned regularly to aerate the materials. Irrigation for the operation is supplied by rainfall. After the items have decomposed to a satisfactory state, they are utilized on campus as mulch/compost or given to the university community.

UofL began on-site composting of pre-consumer food waste from its Belknap campus dining facilities in July 2010. The composting program involves employee and student volunteers and is designed to be educational and coordinated with the campus Garden Commons project.  This program was expanded in 2012 with the hiring of Blueskies who were later acquired by QRS Recycling.  In the first year of the program, the University increased pre-consumer food waste composting by 97.73 tons.  Animal bedding from research activities also was diverted from the landfill starting in 2012.  This allowed the University to divert 178 tons in the performance year.",When leftover or surplus food is available Sodexo donates it to The Lord's Kitchen and Wayside Christian Mission for distribution to the needy.,UofL began on-site composting of pre-consumer food waste from its Belknap campus dining facilities in July 2010.

RECYCLEMANIA
""RecycleMania is a friendly competition and benchmarking tool for college and university recycling programs to promote waste reduction activities to their campus communities. Over an 8-week period each spring, colleges across the United States and Canada report the amount of recycling and trash collected each week and are in turn ranked in various categories based on who recycles the most on a per capita basis, as well as which schools have the best recycling rate as a percentage of total waste and which schools generate the least amount of combined trash and recycling.  With each week’s updated ranking, participating schools follow their performance against other colleges and use the results to rally their campus to reduce and recycle more.""-recyclemaniacs.org

""The GameDay Recycling Challenge is a friendly competition for colleges and universities to promote waste reduction at their football games. During the challenge, colleges and universities implement waste reduction programs during home football games.

UT Arlington’s award-winning composting program is not only practical and environmentally friendly but is an outstanding learning tool and model for others considering similar programs. The program annually composts 32.4 tons of food  waste from on-campus dining services and off-campus coffee shops and hospitals as well as yard waste collected from campus ground crews. The University uses this compost as mulch and soil amendment on campus grounds and in the new community garden.

Vanderbilt also has recycling programs for coal ash, computers and electronics, fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, ink and toner cartridges, confidential paper, and pens and mechanical pencils.
Vanderbilt has 2 full-time recycling coordinators, 4 full-time recycling technicians, and 9 student recycling workers.  VU has a central recycling center and additional outdoor recycling facilities for the collection of traditional materials. Several improvements implemented within the past three years have helped Vanderbilt achieve increased recycling levels, including: 
•	Vanderbilt University recycled 8.7 million pounds of materials in 2015, up 13% since 2014, and just over triple the volume since 2010;
•	Implemented campus recycling program in MRBIII and Learned Lab, increasing overall recycling container capacity in these buildings by nearly 300%;
•	Implemented recycling in 22 off-site buildings on the perimeter of campus;
•	Expansion of glass recycling across campus, increasing the number of glass recycling locations to 9;
•	Donation of 70,000 pounds, or 5 dump truck loads, of wood chips from downed tree limbs and debris on campus to Radnor Lake State Park for use on walking paths; 
•	Expansion of recycling to plastics #3-7 instead of just #1-2, which includes such items as hard plastic labware, food storage containers and clamshell food containers; 
•	Expansion of solid waste recycling at VUMC into Vanderbilt Medical Group areas in the Vanderbilt Clinic and Medical Center East; 
•	Expansion of scrap metal recycling on main campus; 
•	Expansion of cardboard recycling infrastructure on main campus and the installation of new cardboard dumpsters at Branscomb, Carmichael Towers and the Chestnut facility as well as a cardboard compactor at Rand/Sarratt; 
•	Expansion of recycling efforts at Student Move-In through improved collaboration with Students Promoting Environmental Awareness and Responsibility (SPEAR) to successfully recycle almost 39 tons of cardboard, an 4 percent increase in cardboard recycling from the prior year and a 476% increase since 2007; 
•	Improved collaboration with student groups, Vanderbilt Athletics, and Waste Management, Inc., at home football and basketball games to collect plastic, aluminum cans and cardboard from fans during tailgating; and
•	Implementation of the new Vanderbilt Athletics Sustainability Challenge. 
In 2015, VU broke the record for Move-In recycling, collecting 37.26 tons of cardboard, which represents an 5.31% increase over last year and a 453.64% increase since 2007. The nearly 75,000 pounds collected this year average to about 11 pounds for each of the undergraduate students at Vanderbilt. The collection of cardboard at Move-In over the last eight years totals nearly 319,000 pounds, resulting in approximately 2,700 mature trees being saved and over 38,000 cubic feet of landfill space being conserved. Composting: Vanderbilt University has two composting operations on campus: the Commons Center Demonstration Site and the Natchez Triangle leaf and landscaping waste compost pile. The Plant Operations Grounds Department at Vanderbilt collects leaf and landscaping waste from campus to compost at an on-site location, resulting in 97.2 tons of compost in 2015.  The mature landscaping compost is later used to fertilize Vanderbilt grounds. Due to Vanderbilt’s location within the metropolitan Nashville area, the university is not permitted to compost food waste a scale larger than “backyard-size”, only landscaping waste. Metropolitan Nashville health department regulations require institutions who want to compost food waste to use an industrial compost facility.
Vandy FreeSwap: Vandy FreeSwap is a forum for the Vanderbilt community to post and browse items are otherwise unwanted instead of disposing of them in a landfill.
Vanderbilt Dining chefs and management team work very hard to ensure that there is as little waste as possible. This is accomplished by analyzing sales figures, by time of day, day of the week, month, previous trends, peak business hours, etc.

 Paper is allowed in comingled recycling but we would prefer to collect all paper (except brown papers) as mixed paper wherever possible. This is a slight variation on a pure comingled collection process that fits our particular waste stream.

There is an extensive recycling program from common recyclables such as paper and cardboard to less common materials such as electronic media, gypsum board and antifreeze. The university is writing a formal solid waste management plan which is expected to be implemented by fall 2014. We recycle paper, cardboard, metal containers, plastic containers #1-#7, brown, green and clear glass containers, batteries (rechargeable and non-rechargeable), carpet, electronics, electronic media, fluorescent bulbs, scrap metal, motor oil, polystyrene foam, tires, antifreeze and inkjet and toner cartridges. We compost yard waste and have a pilot vermicomposting system for pre-consumer food waste. Dining Services collects all pre-consumer food waste from kitchens and donates to a local farmer for animal food. Some prepared food is distributed to local shelters. Our surplus operation handles sales and donations of all useable materials and equipment from vehicles and furniture to electronics and laboratory supplies.

Starting in January of 2012, WMU has been transferring the handling of recyclables from buildings from student staff to regular custodial staff. This has shifted some of the responsibility for handling waste materials to the generator, thereby making him/her more aware of which materials are recyclable. Also, custodians are always in building so unsightly overflows have been eliminated.

In addition to the transfer of recycling to custodial staff, we are phasing in new stainless steel recycling and trash stations to replace our plastic recycling bins and multiple types of trash containers. These new stations have updated signage in bold colors explaining what can be placed into each container and where the contents will go (landfill, recycling or compost).","WMU collects kitchen prep waste (fruit and vegetable only) and donates it to Bearfoot Farms for use as hog food. Bearfoot Farms provides the transportation. Last year (calendar year 2013) we donated 78,500 pounds.

For all other food donations we work with the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission.  The Gospel Mission uses a volunteer driver to come to campus most Saturdays to pick up donated food.  At the end of the fall and spring semester, they come to each dining unit to pick up food. 
 
The primary food donated is produce items.  At the end of the semesters, we also donate left over dairy products and in some cases, bread products.  Occasionally, we have left over prepared food that has been properly cooled per Food Code, and these items are donated, such as Macaroni and Cheese or Lasagna.  At the end of the semesters, we may have some items to donate that are getting close to a manufacturer's best used by date such as cereals or salad dressings.

A food product is only donated if we are certain it cannot be used in Dining Services.  It is never our plan to purchase or produce food that will be donated or disposed of.  Purchasing and production are the keys to minimizing food waste, and that is what we emphasize and put our effort into.  Given that we want to provide all customers with a choice of all menu items, we do generate waste as the student entering five minutes before we close should have the same choices as the student entering when we open.  Some of the items that do get disposed of are items we cannot reuse or save or donate, such as left over French Fries.  If items were on a customer's plate or could have been contaminated by a customer, we dispose of the item.
 
We have recipes for every item we prepare and the cooling instructions is at the bottom of every recipe per Food Code requirements.
