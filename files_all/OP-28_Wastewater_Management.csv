A federally mandated industrial pretreatment program prevents non-conventional pollutants from entering the wastewater system in amounts greater than the plant can treat.

Wastewater treatment incorporates: preliminary screening, primary clarification, biological treatment, chemical phosphorus removal, chlorination for disinfection and de-chlorination. Anaerobic digestion is used to stabilize biosolids, which are then dewatered and land-filled. The anaerobic digestion process produces biogas (65-70 % methane) that is purified and then burned to generate electricity and hot water."

On GW's campuses storm and waste water treatment includes mostly primary treatment.  Waste water from most laboratories is neutralized before discharge.

However, waste water from four kitchens (Marvin Center 1st and 2nd floors and two at Shenkman Hall in Gallery Grill) is treated biologically before discharge using a mixture of five types of aerobic (3) and anaerobic (2) bacteria.  The bacteria specifically target fats, oils, and greases (""FOG"") discharged from these kitchens prior to release to the sewer and POTW.  This treatment program was in place at three kitchens before this performance year, and it was added to a fourth kitchen (Marvin Center 2nd floor) during the performance year, which earned GW a ""Best Green Product of 2014"" certificate/award from the U.S. Green Building Council.
