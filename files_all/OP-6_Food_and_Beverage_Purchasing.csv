•	Implementing Energy and Water Conservation practices
•	Purchase only compostable disposable Products
•	Use only Daily Green Cleaning Products
•	Divert 100% of Fryer Oil Waste
•	Increasing Sustainable Food purchases each year

AU Dining Services has made responsible purchasing of locally-grown and third-party certified foods a high priority. Current goals include working to ensure that as much local, seasonal produce as possible is captured. AU Dining Services serves exclusively Humane Certified cage-free eggs, and all the coffee served in residential dining rooms, catering and convenience stores is organic and fair trade.

•	We’ve taken important steps to make sure our purchases are made in a responsible and ethical way, including:
•	Providing a wide spectrum of responsibly sourced food products, such as sustainably sourced seafood, humanely raised proteins and fair-trade, certified coffee.
•	Adopting animal welfare principles and purchasing commitments that address a broad spectrum of issues impacting the treatment of animals for egg, pork, veal, beef, poultry and dairy products served across our operations.
•	Offering clients and customers fresh, safe, whole foods that are raised, grown, and harvested in a sustainable manner, whenever possible.
•	Sourcing products locally, supporting local farmers and fisheries while reducing transportation fuel and emissions
•	Using environmentally preferable products, like reusable or compostable to-go containers.

We purchased 13.6% local in 2014.  Down 1% from 2013; however, dollars spent on local purchases increased by $72,000.  Since reaching 10% in 2011, we have shown growth each year.  We anticipate additional growth in subsequent years.   

Being self-operated makes us ""local"" in every sense of the word.  We employ a local staff to prepare the food that is served on campus - from the produce that is prepped in our Vegetable Prep area, to the baked goods and desserts that are produced in our Bake Shop, to the entrees that are prepared in our kitchens by local chefs and cooks. 

We first began seriously working to source local products in 2010; over the years we have worked closely with the Office of Sustainability to research how other colleges and universities define local. 

Taking this research into account, we have defined local as:

•	Appalachian Grown™ products
•	Got to Be NC / Goodness Grows in NC products
•	NC products
•	Regional products (grown and produced within 250 miles of Appalachian)
•	Third-party certified products (such as Organic and Fair Trade)

We have worked with our nationwide and local distributors to determine what local products we are currently purchasing.  We have published this “Always Local” list on our website.  Key items include:  Rainforest Alliance Certified coffee, eggs, dairy products, grits, organic tempeh and tofu, fresh poultry, ground beef and bratwurst, apples and sweet potatoes. 

To grow our local percentage, we have established open lines of communication with local growers/producers and have purchased in-season produce as well as items for special events and catering.  To illustrate our commitment to the campus community, we have scheduled twice yearly local meals, Carolina Chowdown:  A Local Food Feast. 

We are especially proud of Local Appetite, a partnership that brought together farmers, community organizations and the university.  We used our purchasing power to invest in the local, rural farms that have few opportunities to sell to institutional buyers, and the farmers planted crops knowing that they had a guaranteed market.  We purchased $8,000 of produce in 2013.  In 2014, we saw a 39% increase in total cases purchased and a 35% increase in dollars spent. 

We continue to seek out companies with good sustainability practices as well as research how to improve our own.  Currently, we purchase meat, frozen vegetables and other food items in bulk to eliminate excess packaging.  We also utilize returnable racks for our bread, milk and water deliveries.

Moving forward, we will continue to work with our distributors to identify additional local and sustainable products, strengthen existing relationships with local growers/producers and explore new ones, and continue to respond to the demands for local food and sustainable practices at Appalachian.

Brown University is involved with the Real Food Challenge, which sets a goal for universities to reach 20% real food annually by 2020.  We have not only exceeded expectations with 22% of food purchases being considered ‘real food’ but have also received the 2011 Pioneer Award from the Real Food Challenge.  The university uses its purchasing power to support a healthy food ecosystem in Rhode Island that strengthens local economies, respects human rights, ensures ecological sustainability, and facilitates community involvement and education.
BDS has maintained a committed relationship with local farmers and co-ops such as the Rhode Island Dairy Farms Cooperative, a group of 8 dairy farms located throughout the state.  We work year-round with more than 50 local farms and farmers for our residential dining, retail and catering programs. Areas of focus have included milk, cage-free eggs, beef, fish, shellfish, and coffee. BDS currently sources 35% percent of its food locally, including 97 percent of its seafood and 95 percent of its cage free eggs.  We are also among a limited number of universities that operates its own Bake Shop and Butcher Shop. BDS also sources 100 percent of its coffee fair trade and ecologically sound.  These initiatives have allowed Brown Catering Services the opportunity to offer sustainable catering options focusing on local and seasonal items.  These meals are served on compostable Greenware and feature signage with information on local vendors.
Brown also has many programs focused on conservation and environmental sustainability.  BDS has eliminated its bottled water purchases since instituting Beyond the Bottle in 2008, offers reusable Eco-To-Go containers at two of its locations, sells reusable mugs, has saved an average of 155,000 gallons of water per year since 2009 with our Trayless dining program and are part of an initial ten school EPA funded Nitrogen Footprint pilot across the US.  BDS diverts approximately 12,000 pounds of meat scraps per year and has partnered with the Compost Plant and Earth Care Farms to institute composting at our five major dining locations.  We have also partnered with Newport Biodiesel, a local company that takes used fry-oil and turns it into a renewable biofuel for diesel engines and home heating. Brown generated 5,509 gallons oil and grease this year.  BDS also worked with We Share Hope to donate 25,076 pounds of food this year to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, Providence Rescue Mission, McCauley House, City Year, and Camp Street Ministries.
","Brown Dining Services tracks its food and beverage inventory through the Food Service Suite software platform and participates in the Real Food Initiative, which tracks all food purchases based on whether or not they’re local, humane, fair, or ecological",8273609.0,--,3359085.0,--,**,True,**,True,"Brown Dining Services has been a participant in the Real Food Program since 2009.

An exciting development as a part of this initiative is the research conducted by Ararmark director, Michelle Crowe, who has investigated the College’s FY2012 food purchasing by region. This information, presented in the map below, is the College’s first documentation of food purchasing. While we only have 71% of our food purchases represented here, and likely many of those not represented are from areas outside of our region (decreasing the percentage that is with-in the 250 mile radius) these data represent a crucial step in making more sustainable food choices a reality at the College. As we look forward to next semester, we hope to further our efforts by continuing to investigate food purchasing, conducting waste audits of the dining halls on campus, as well as integrating additional sustainable practices into dining services at the College of Charleston.","As part of a Masters thesis around food purchasing policy, these data were collected through invoices from the two main dining halls on campus during the spring 2013 semester. These invoices were then cross referenced with information from vendors used to supply food for the campus as to any qualifying local and community purchases.",--,--,--,--,**,--,**,--,,http://sustainability.cofc.edu/initiatives/index.php#Food,True,--,True,True,True,--,True,--,True,--,True,--,--

COA Dining Services is committed to providing high quality, healthy, delicious and predominately hand‐prepared meals, incorporating the use of local and organic food products whenever possible. We offer affordable meals at Blair Dining Hall and Sea Urchin Café during the week and provide catering for college events, meetings, and celebrations. Dining Services are a vital part of the COA community and we want to promote healthy selections to support a healthy lifestyle. By considering the environmental, social, economic and political impacts of food, we are able to prepare meals that promote the values of the college while remaining committed to providing excellent and responsive service. We strive to be a center for food education and experiential learning for the COA community and beyond.

COA is among the inaugural signers of the Real Food Campus Commitment, pledging that 20% of our food will be from organic, fair trade, and local sources by 2020. COA has met and exceeded that pledge already, with 30% of COA food sourced in the described manner and considered “real” by commitment standards.","Work study students track all food purchase receipts and enter each product into a spreadsheet.

These guidelines define ""local"" food as being from Georgia and food from the surrounding 8 states as ""regional.""   Sustainably grown is defined as products that adhere to one or more of the following criteria:
• Certified USDA Organic
• Produced free from routine use of antibiotics and hormones

Ecova collected purchase invoices from Emory’s suppliers, as well as details on product locality and sustainability of purchases in each food category.

Emory does not use the STARS definition of local (“being based or originating within 250 miles (400 kilometres) of the institution”) because this radius does not make sense for the Southeast region.  Our food supply is more seasonal and draws over the course of the year from surrounding states.  Thus, Emory has adopted a definition of local food as deriving from Georgia and eight surrounding states. The percentage of sustainable food purchases listed here is based on a comprehensive assessment by ECOVA, as described.  

Emory does not include vending services in its local and sustainable food purchases, but data for on-site franchises and the only campus convenience store will be included in this section. We are unable to extract this data from our total dining services tracking because Emory’s contracted food service provider makes purchases for on-site franchises and convenience stores along with residential dining purchases.

When these machines were inventoried in 2014, none of them contained food or beverages that are sustainably produced according to STARS guidelines. The company Chartwells runs our dining services and snack bar (called the Buttery) and all of their purchases are counted in the dining services calculation. There are no other permanent sources of food sales on campus. Occasionally, vendors or fundraising organizations sell food at sports events, but less than 1% of this food meets the STARS criteria. ","Green Mountain College’s Sustainable Food Purchasing Initiative (in conjunction with Chartwells Dining Services):
In addition to offering a master's program in Sustainable Food Systems, the College is nationally known for its major in Sustainable Agriculture & Food Production, an academic program that offers students the opportunity to work on the college’s on-campus farm.

Through a combination of coursework and experience working on the farm, students are able to explore vegetable production, livestock management, development of farm infrastructure, and marketing techniques as they take part in producing some of the vegetables, eggs, and meats featured in the dining hall. Along with Chartwells dining services, students and faculty have long been exploring new ways to
offer local, community-based, organic, and other sustainable food options.

Ever year, GMC’s Chartwells dining services purchases over $15,000 worth of produce and meat from the college farm to be served in the GMC dining hall. When food from the farm is served in the dining hall, it is often celebrated with special signage indicating its origin or an event to honor the dish. For example, in 2012, the purchase of 600lbs of pork raised by students on the college farm prompted a celebratory localvore feast which featured the pork and an array of seasonal vegetables and other Vermont products. Not only did the feast use local food, but the students also invited farmers and food vendors from all over the county for the free dinner.

In addition to sourcing ingredients from the college farm, Chartwells spends over $15,000 per month in support of Vermont farms and dairies. These sources include Vermont-based producers such as Black River Produce, Thomas Dairy, Champlain Orchards, and Cerridwen Farm. The dining hall also supports local businesses in purchases of non-food items such as linens and kitchenware. Green Mountain College strives to increase sustainable purchasing and uses small-scale New England based distributors when logistically and financially feasible. Such distributors include companies such as Sid Wainer, Black River, Green Mountain Coffee Company, Purdy and Son’s, Vermont Roots, and Foley Services. Most of these companies are small and local, and as such can more readily be held accountable for environmental and social responsibility than some of the larger and more inaccessible corporations.

Green Mountain College’s sustainable purchasing policy (created by a public policy class in the spring of 2014 and approved by Cabinet in August of 2014) calls on dining services to ensure that 40% of all food purchased meets STARS criteria for local/community-based and/or third-party certified.","General methodology:
Invoices from Chartwell’s (GMC’s dining services company) were examined for local and community-based, and/or organic purchases by GMC’s sustainability office with oversight from GMC’s director of sustainability. Researchers examined vendor websites and conferred with dining services staff  to screen products for the criteria.

The total local and community based and/or third-party certified percentage was derived from dividing total credit-worthy purchases by the total food expenditures for the sum of the two sample months. 

Time Boundaries: The reporting year is 2015 and is based on a sample of February , 2015 (a month known to be heavy on local purchases) and September, 2015 (a month known to be light on local purchases).

Physical Boundaries: Local was defined as grown within 250 miles to be consistent with STARS.

Performance year for the total annual food and beverage expenditures is Chartwells' fiscal year 2015 (October 2014 to September 2015).

""Farm to Fork is a companywide initiative to buy locally, formalized in 1999 by Bon Appetit. Our first choice is to purchase seasonal ingredients from small, owner-operated farms and ranches within a 150-mile radius of your café. Food grown locally is fresher, better tasting, and often has greater nutritional value. Our commitment to local food is about preserving biodiversity, protecting open space, supporting family farmers, and keeping money invested in your community.

Thanks to the tireless efforts of several individuals, led by Muhlenberg’s Executive Chefs, a new partnership was born with Lancaster Farm Fresh Cooperative. 
o	LFFC is a non-profit, organic farmers’ cooperative of 75 farmers in the Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (approximately 70 miles from Muhlenberg). Each week LFFC delivers a fresh bounty of produce, most of which is picked the day prior to delivery. 
o	Since the beginning of that year, we  spent $3060.95 with LCFF. This is probably only about 2% of our purchases.
o	The items we receive from Lancaster Farm Fresh Cooperative are apples, apple cider, flat bread, brownies, whoopee pies, an assortment of cookies, and granola bars.

o	We receive the weekly local item ordering guides from several vendors. Our culinary team reviews the items and order based on seasonal availability and upcoming menu, special events and catering. The culinary team then shares a local purchasing report with marketing to communicate to with customers.

•	The website URL where information about Muhlenberg’s Sustainable food and beverage purchasing efforts is available:
o	http://dining.muhlenberg.edu/sustainability.html
After the partnership with LFFC was established, Muhlenberg Dining looked at other potential providers for local farm food.  Again, through efforts from our Executive Chefs and Purchasing Department an additional partnership was formed with Common Market of Philadelphia.  Their mission is to strengthen regional farms while making the local bounty accessible to communities and the institutions that serve them. We provide the infrastructure to connect public and private schools, hospitals, universities, grocery stores and workplaces to good food grown by our region’s sustainable farmers.  Common Market provides farm-fresh produce from approximately 75 regional farms and delivers to about 150 different customers.  Since the beginning of September we have purchased $21,885.64, about 1.14% of total food purchases and 6.12% of Produce purchases.  Items we purchase from Common market include Apples, Eggs, Tahini, Kale, Squashes, Melons, Mushrooms, Tofu, Collards and Sweet Potatoes.
In the spring of 2015, Muhlenberg Dining looked at a variety of coffee programs to offer in the Wood Dining Commons.  After taste tests and student input, the decision was made to convert from Green Mountain Coffee to Peet’s Coffee.  Peet’s philosophy regarding the coffee industry is a simple one – Where the land is respected and the people who farm it live well, the coffee is –quite simply- better.  It’s their belief that “long-term, direct relationships with our coffee partners, whose quality earns them premium prices that are substantially higher than market prices and always above the Fair Trade CertifiedTM brand price.”   They also have a focused philanthropy where they “help educate coffee farmers on how to improve their coffee quality as well as support and donate to organizations dedicated to bettering the lives of people who live in coffee-growing regions.  Peet’s also roasts 100% of their coffee in a LEED Gold certified roasting faciltiy.  In the spring of 2016, the Admissions Office converted their office coffee program to Peet’s.  A contributing factor in the decision was Peet’s Fair Trade programs and giving back to the communities that produce their great coffee.

",True,10.0,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/610/6/481/3694/Inventory_of_Local_Food_Providers%202016.docx,,"We found it impractical to separate the purchases of on-site franchises, convenience stores, vending services, and concessions from those of our other dining operations, so we reported the overall percentage of campus food and beverage purchases that are sustainably produced for both parts of this item.
On-site franchises: The main ingredients for the majority of products that are used our one on-site franchise, Java Joe’s, cannot be locally produced, namely coffee beans, cocoa, and tea. 
Convenience Stores: Our on-campus convenience store, the ‘Berg Bookshop, does not sell local food, only a very limited number of snacks produced by large companies. All local food is sold in our two main dining options, the main dining hall and GQ. This is because the Berg Bookshop is located in the basement of Seegers, where there is not much student traffic. 
Vending services: Mobile vendors do not come to our campus. These businesses are more for large city-esque campuses. Although we do have vending machines, their content is dictated by companies we have contracts with, so they mostly have drinks and snacks made by large corporations.
Concessions: We do not have concessions - all food for all events are catered by Sodexo. This criterion most likely applies to large schools with frequent large sporting events.  

So for the second portion of this item, we estimate that out of our total purchases for all food on campus, which would include food in the GQ and Java Joes (which in comparison to the dining hall is pretty small), the amount of food that is sustainably/locally produced would still be around 10%.

The bids for those awards focused on our desire to source locally, and the resulting contracts were awarded to Broughton Dairy (milk) and White Feather Farms (fresh chicken, beef, pork and Halal products).  The fresh meat bid also focused on humane production.  Combined milk and fresh meat purchases for the University total of approximately $1.25 million per year.

The University also partners with local farmers (Hidden Hills Orchard and Cowdery Farms) to source seasonal produce (apples, peppers, etc.).  Combined yearly purchases from these local producers total approximately $40,000 per year.

The University also partners with Silver Bridge Coffee, which is locally produced and is a member of Fair Trade USA.  The University spends approximately $18,000 a year on fair trade coffee from Silver Bridge.

Other partners who provide locally produced products with locally-sourced ingredient include Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, Shagbark Seed and Mill, Frog Ranch Foods & Vino de Milo.  Purchases from these vendors total $56,000.

In 2009 guidelines were developed to encourage Pennsylvania companies to partner with the University.  Our current standard for sustainable purchases includes those products processed within or grown or raised within the state of Pennsylvania. 

All products meeting our PA/Green standards are purchased on a competitive bid basis and, in addition to meeting our standards, are also our best pricing alternatives. We currently allow for a small cost premium for PA produce items on the UP campus, in order to encourage our produce suppliers to source PA grown products.  

We continue to put great efforts into increasing the number of PA vendors we purchase from directly, as well as the amount that we purchase from them.

For 3rd party certified products, our requirements vary by product. For example, for egg products we require UEP or American humane certification.

",--,--,,,"Dining services seeks food that is locally grown or processed within 150 miles and environmentally beneficial foods which are organic, hormone or antibiotic free, and humane foods which are cage-free or fair trade.  

As a member of CISA (Community in Support of Agriculture), a national organization that supports collaboration of local farmers with local institutions and restaurants, the college supports local farmers and spreads awareness of the importance of buying locally.  Smith purchases cage-free eggs and fair trade/organic/kosher coffee from Indigo Coffee Company in nearby Florence, MA.  Dairy products are purchased from High Lawn Farm in Lee, MA, which come from pastured Jersey cows that do not receive artificial growth hormones.  

Dining Services purchases Vermont-raised ground beef, brisket, top round and pork from Black River Produce in North Springfield, Vt. Black River produces meats from pasture-fed animals that do not receive antibiotics or hormones.

Local, seasonal produce comes from local farmers as much as possible, given the quantities we must obtain. The majority of local produce comes from Outlook Farm in Westhampton, MA, where Dining Services has been purchasing apples for the past 60 years. What Outlook Farm cannot provide at their farm, they purchase from other local farmers and deliver to Smith twice weekly.

During February and March, winter vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, radishes, and beets are delivered to campus by bike from Hadley, MA. 

Black River Produce, located in Southern Vermont, is our other source for locally-grown produce. They provide a list of current, locally grown products and note on their delivery invoices what is locally grown.

",--,21.0,,No list exists,"SUNY Geneseo has long recognized the importance of purchasing and serving local foods, and actively seek solutions to increase the amounts of local foods served on campus.  In fact, Geneseo just recently signed the Pride of NY Pledge and became a member of the Taste NY initiative, committing to further increase purchases of local food and beverages.  

Serving local foods on a college campus is not without challenges; college is not in session during most of the Western NY growing season, and most small farmers are not set up for case packaging and distribution to multiple locations or locations smaller than a large distribution center.  Geneseo chooses to see these challenges not as obstacles but as opportunities to become creative and innovative in sourcing and providing local foods to the campus.  

Geneseo partners with American Fruit and Vegetable, a local produce distributor, for all of its produce.  American Fruit and Vegetable is a proud supporter of local farmers and locally grown produce and is a member of the Pride of NY program.  Through American, we are able to purchase over 35 different local produce items from over 20 NYS farms.  American ensures the quality and safety of the produce, and their distribution model reduces the amount of truckscoming onto campus, cutting emissions and creating efficiencies that have a positive sustainable impact.  

Purdy & Sons is another local distributor that offers an innovative solution to providing NYS produce year round.  Purdy introduces farmers to other local distributors who cut, freeze and pack the produce which he then distributes to customers across the state.  Through our relationship with Purdy & Sons, we are able to serve locally grown produce that is flash frozen at the peak of freshness throughout the school year.  The corn that is featured in our NY Corn Soup is from Purdy’s.

Dairy is NYS leading agricultural sector, and we have tapped into that local segment.  All dairy for the campus is purchased through Upstate Farms, a cooperative of over 360 local family farms.  The cooperative is owned and operated by the very farmers who make the milk and purchasing through them nurtures the local economy and keeps the rural integrity of local family farms.  Last year, purchases from Upstate Farms exceeded $117,000, which included over 22,500 gallons of milk.  

All of our local distributors and vendors are treated as partners in the true sense of the word.  We meet regularly with members of the companies and tour the farms where the food comes from.  We also invite the farmers and local food producers that work with the distributors to campus to be able to speak directly with our students and members of our campus community.

2. Sustainable Oceans: Compass Group is committed to protecting the threatened global fish supply. In collaboration with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program we established a landmark purchasing policy in 2006 that removes unsustainable wild and farmed seafood from our menus. We are working diligently to engage the salmon, shrimp and tilapia aquaculture industry to implement sustainable methods of production using open and frequent dialog paired with specific goals and timelines. Our goal is to remove 500,000 lbs of unsustainable farmed seafood over a 3 year period ending 2013.
3. Certified Humane/Cage Free Eggs: Because of our commitment to the humane care of farm animals, we offer only HFAC certified Cage Free shell eggs* nationwide.
4. Poultry produced without the routine use of human antibiotics: The non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in animal production is a growing public health concern because it decreases the effectiveness of antibiotics to treat diseases in humans. Therefore, we only serve chicken* and turkey* that has been produced with restricted use of these drugs, especially as a growth additive in feed. Our contracted suppliers are required to provide products which adhere to specific criteria developed in partnership with The Environmental Defense Fund.
5. rBGH Free Yogurt and Milk: Science and experience has clearly demonstrated that the use of artificial bovine growth hormones in dairy cows is detrimental to the well-being of the animal. The medical community has expressed apprehension that the use of these hormones may also be harmful to human health. Due to these concerns, we serve only fresh fluid milk* and fresh yogurt from cows that have been certified to be free of the artificial growth hormones rBGH/rBST.
8. Social and ecological certified coffee: Coffee production can have a tremendous impact on the social or environmental well being of the countries where it is produced. Responsible production methods are certified in a variety of ways including Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Shade Grown and Organic. We encourage our units to offer a responsible choice based on client and guest preference and availability from the coffee partner.","The method of tracking local, sustainable and 3rd party verified food and beverage purchases is done through the organization's purchasing department’s database.

In 1995 with the renovation of our largest dining center, Dewick-MacPhie, it was established that both dining centers would feature organic whole grains and legumes exclusively on the vegetarian stations.  Other organic items were sourced as well, including (local) oatmeal, tofu, granola, and peanut butter.   

The commitment to purchase locally grown food during fall semester began in 2002.  Today, we purchase as much locally grown produce as is available from our produce distributor, Costa Fruit and Produce, and in the fall of 2015 we added local tomatoes and hand fruit from Red Tomato. We also are working closely with Roberts in Rhode Island (who distribute through Sysco Boston) for processed vegetables, directing them to acquire as much local vegetables as possible throughout the growing season. Although we are limited by the short New England growing season we maximize what we purchase by creating seasonal menus that highlight the produce which is grown locally.  Tufts also sources organically grown produce during September and October from the Tufts New Entry Sustainable Farming Project.  The NESFP, a non-profit organization affiliated with Tufts’ Friedman School of Nutrition, is devoted to providing the next generation of farmers with the skills to find land, reach consumers, and get the training to succeed. 

With regards to seafood, we began sourcing from Red's Best in September 2015 to feature locally fished seafood.  We are mindful of our purchases, preferring to purchase fish from local waters that are deemed as acceptable based on government information and seafood guides. 

Tufts Dining purchases its milk from Garelick Farms (Dean Foods), which sources it locally from dairy farms in Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York.

UBC Food Services prioritizes planning menus around sustainable products and services and making ethical choices for procuring everything from food, packaging and services. Initiatives include the following:
•	Fresh seafood is 100% Ocean Wise certified meaning species are non-endangered and caught using sustainable fishing practices.
•	Fresh poultry is free run, Halal certified and locally sourced.
•	All whole shell eggs come from free run hens.
•	Coffee served in non-franchised outlets is 100% fair trade, locally roasted, organic and shade grown.
•	Tea served is 100% fair trade and organic, sourced from Zhena’s Gypsy Teas.
•	Produce is locally-sourced and served in season whenever possible.

As a leader in providing healthy, well-balanced meals to the campus community and an enriched educational environment that foster a balance of mind, body, and soul, UC Davis Dining Services has developed an integrated sustainable food systems program in each of the campus dining commons, University Catering and several retail operations.

The Coffee House is proud to be a sustainable operation on the UC Davis campus. What is Coffee House sustainability? Well, there are two main components:

The first component is in our purchasing practices. The Coffee House uses its purchasing power to support the companies, practices and ideals that we feel help our local and global community. For instance, the Coffee House’s coffee selection is organic, fair trade, and shade-grown, giving maximum benefit to the farmer and the land on which the coffee is grown. We have also developed a relationship with local farmers, through our produce provider (Trinity Fresh) and the UC Davis Student Farms, to make organic and locally-grown fruits and vegetables available to our customers whenever possible.

The second component of the Coffee House sustainability program is education. In addition to making sustainability-conscious purchasing decisions, the Coffee House believes in the importance of educating its customers on the benefits of living a sustainable lifestyle. Local and organic food items are labeled accordingly, creating an awareness of the path that their food has taken and how the customer’s food selections can impact the global community. As an employer of over 200 college students, the Coffee House also strives to bestow upon its employees a sense of pride in the social impact made by their employer.","UC Davis Dining Services sustainable food purchases report is based on a full fiscal year analysis of all food purchases including summer conference services and summer sales in retail locations.

As of June 2009, the University of California has established food services practices goals for all campuses that foster sustainability. The Sustainable Foodservice Practices Policy Guidelines have established an overreaching goal for all UC Campus Foodservice Operations (self-operated, franchise operated, or contract operated) to acquire 20% sustainable food products by 2020. Each campus will track their percentage of food budget spent on sustainable products, outline their goals, and provide a report to the Office of the President. These guidelines define Sustainable Food as meeting one of seventeen criteria, including locally grown, Fair Trade, humanely raised, Certified Organic, and Seafood Watch recommended. These guidelines will continue to be reviewed and updated by the UC Sustainability Steering Committee.

UCLA Dining Services, ASUCLA, and the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center continue to asses their current food purchases. Each food service operation estimated its sustainable food spend per UCOP sustainability criteria. In 2013, the Ronald Reagan Medical Center surpassed the 20% policy goal and achieved nearly 30% sustainable food in 2014.

The sustainability commitment of UNH Dining is part of the university’s broader Food & Society Initiative, which commits UNH to being a sustainable food community that promotes healthy food systems from farm to fork to health and nutrition outcomes.

Serving locally and regionally grown, produced, and manufactured items ensures that the food served is the freshest possible while helping to support our local economy, a vibrant regional agricultural infrastructure, and a healthy food system. We look for farms and food producers or manufacturers located within a 250 mile radius from UNH. Additional criteria that UNH Dining considers in its purchasing decisions include:

USDA Certified Organic: This certification indicates that specific production and handling practices were taken for the applicable food items. Producers must apply for certification annually, and producers' operations are inspected annually to ensure that all criteria are being met properly. Examples of USDA Certified Organic foods served on campus include vegetables from the UNH Organic Garden Club, Stonyfield Farm yogurt, and Abigail's Bakery bread.

Fair Trade Certified: Fair Trade Certified ""guarantees consumers that strict economic, social and environmental criteria were met in the production and trade of an agricultural product. Fair Trade Certification is currently available in the U.S. for coffee, tea and herbs, cocoa and chocolate, fresh fruit, flowers, sugar, rice, and vanilla. TransFair USA licenses companies to display the Fair Trade Certified label on products that meet strict international Fair Trade standards."" (from TransFair USA) Examples of Fair Trade Certified foods served on campus include Green Mountain coffee and Omar coffee.

Certified Humane: Certified Humane means that producers meet ""the Humane Animal Care Program standards, which include nutritious diet without antibiotics, or hormones, animals raised with shelter, resting areas, sufficient space and the ability to engage in natural behaviors.""

Real Food criteria will be kept in mind; once/if President Pastides signs the Real Food Commitment, the LIPS can begin tracking Real Food criteria. 

2.	Carolina Dining will host and facilitate a stakeholder engagement meeting including Senn Brothers, Senn’s local suppliers, Carolina Dining, and the Office of Sustainability to discuss a transparent, traceable system to track produce from farm to dining hall. 

3.	Carolina Dining will create branding/marketing templates to introduce the public to local suppliers as they enter the campus dining system and to uniformly and clearly label local produce with point of origin in dining halls.

4.	Carolina Dining will publicize its approved Spring 2016 sustainability plan, members of its sustainability working group, and local suppliers on its website.

5.	Carolina Dining will provide a space on its website where prospective local suppliers can register their interest. A brief survey which will help Dining decide if they want to pursue a supplier will be included so that Carolina Dining can provide feedback to each prospective supplier in a timely manner. 

6.	Carolina Dining will research costs and use of reusable, recyclable, and compostable products to inform decision-making on future purchases. 

7.	Carolina Dining will work with Carolina Productions in spring 2016 to plan food and sustainability related films for the “Carolina Dining Night at the Movies” for the 2016-17 school year. 

8.	Carolina Dining will use the Sustainable Carolina Farm & Garden hydroponics purchases to create uniformity in identification, delivery, labeling, and purchasing local products. By the end of spring 2016, one hydroponics unit will be piloted within a dining hall.

This year, Diversity undertook a voluntary audit through Leaders in Environmentally Accountable Food Service (LEAF).  LEAF offers accreditation to restaurants demonstrating environmentally sustainable foodservice practices, and provides a benchmark for foodservice establishments across Canada. Three levels of certification are available.
Diversity earned a total of 449 points through the audit, well above the minimum of 300 points required to earn the third and highest level of LEAF certification.  Particularly noteworthy achievements include:

- 65% of food purchased comes from local family farms within 100 km of the University, 100% of seafood purchases are OceanWise certified, 100% of coffee, tea, rice, sugar, and retail chocolate is either fair trade or direct trade;

- The use of only compostable packaging and 100% recycled paper products;

- A robust waste diversion and reduction program that includes pre-and post- consumer composting, bi-weekly food donations, bulk condiment purchasing, strict inventory controls, and recycling of used grease.

Unfortunately, Diversity did not meet one of the prerequisites for level 3 certification – that 60% of equipment in use be Energy STAR certified.

There are many items regularly served in the dining halls and Campus Cafés, or purchased for our special events that fall within this definition of Locally Sourced. Most entrees and many of the side dishes, soups, salads and desserts are prepared in our kitchens. Food items prepared from recipes using primarily a particular food, or a significant majority of ingredients from the Great Lakes region will also be labeled with the Locally Sourced logo.

Our produce is from a local distributor in Niles, Michigan who obtain much of their produce from this region. Produce items are labeled with the Locally Sourced label when they have been grown within the Great Lakes region.

Aramark’s Green Thread Philosophy
At ARAMARK Higher Education, we have a deep respect for and commitment to protecting and improving the environment. Aramark is committed to long-term environmental stewardship programs and policies within the areas of sustainable food, responsible procurement, green buildings, energy and water conservation, transportation, and waste stream management.  We work to reduce our environmental footprint while delivering exceptional operational results, and offer expertise along with practical solutions for our campus partners to help them reduce their environmental impacts.  The company refers to these programs and policies as “Green Thread” woven into their business operations.
Green Thread promotes sustainable practices within six categories or “pillars of stewardship”: 
•	Sustainable Foods 
•	Green Buildings 
•	Waste Stream Management 
•	Responsible Procurement 
•	Energy and Water Conservation 
•	Transportation 
Sustainable Food
We understand the vital importance of food in our daily lives and interactions. Our food choices have a significant impact on our health, our culture, and the natural environment in local and global economies.  As an organization we are committed to strengthening our existing network and beginning new connections that make positive transitions from field to fork. We in the business of changing the culture of food by nourishing our guests with menus that emphasize fresh whole foods. These foods are grown and harvested locally and sustainably wherever possible and are prepared in ways that respect and maintain quality, freshness, and pureness.
  
ARAMARK Higher Education’s National Commitment to Affect Positive Sustainable Change
As part of their environmental stewardship program Aramark develops unique solutions for campus partners that support environmental commitments in every one of the 500+ Higher Education accounts they serve.  Aramark calls these global commitments Green Stakes™ - our stakes in the ground, and our national commitments to affect change. The stakes include:

1. Energy and Water conservation program at each campus
2. Only purchasing paper products with recycled content
3. Using Green Cleaning products
4. Diverting 100 percent of the fryer oil waste  
5. Increasing sustainable food options to consumers by 5 percent annually

Aramark works with the following sustainable food organizations:

USDA Organic: USDA's National Organic Program regulates the standards for any farm, wild crop harvesting, or handling operation that wants to sell an agricultural product as organically produced.
Seafood Watch: A program of Monterey Bay Aquarium designed to raise consumer awareness about the importance of buying seafood from sustainable sources. We recommend which seafood to buy or avoid, a service that helps consumers to become advocates for environmentally friendly seafood.
The Rainforest Alliance works to conserve biodiversity and ensure sustainable livelihoods by transforming land-use practices, business practices and consumer behavior. Companies, cooperatives, and landowners that participate in our programs meet rigorous standards to conserve biodiversity and provide sustainable livelihoods.
The Fair Trade Certified™ guarantees consumers that strict economic, social and environmental criteria were met to produce and trade a particular agriculture product. Fair Trade Certification is currently available in the U.S. for coffee, tea and herbs, cocoa and chocolate, fresh fruit, flowers, sugar, rice, and vanilla.
Food Alliance is a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable agriculture by recognizing and rewarding farmers who produce food in environmentally friendly and socially responsible ways, and educating consumers and others in the food system about the benefits of sustainable agriculture.

Local and seasonal produce- Tagge Farms and New Roots Farm SLC UT
Doughnuts - Banbury Cross Donuts SLC UT","Bon Appetit works with a program called Farm to Fork, which focuses on getting local food, owner-operated. Below are some more details: 

Farm to Fork: 
At its core, Farm to Fork has always been about preserving flavors and supporting small, owner- operated producers in the communities we serve. As the American food system has consolidated, we have lost flavors on the plate; Farm to Fork gives our chefs the freedom to buy from producers who are harvesting food that tastes special.

Plant-based products, including fruit, vegetables, grains, floral products:
1. Geographic: farms, orchards, and mills that are within 150 miles of our kitchens. To be considered Farm to Fork, milled grains must come from within 150 miles as well as be milled locally.
2. Ownership: owner-operated concerns or co-ops of owner-operators. Non-profit distributors (aggregators) can be enrolled if all of their products qualify as Farm to Fork and they have a reliable traceability system in place. Similarly, farmers who are “for-profit” can act as aggregators for neighboring farmers, can be enrolled if all the products they sell to our chefs qualify as Farm to Fork and they have a robust traceability system in place.
3. Annual sales volume: $5 million if a sole proprietorship, farm, orchard, or an LLC. If a co-op, all members must gross $5 million or less and be a true co-op rather than contractors to a large corporation. (There is no sales limit for a product distributor who merely delivers products from enrolled vendors and can clearly identify sources on their price sheets and invoices.)

Proteins, including meat, poultry and eggs, dairy and cheese, seafood (small scale)
1. Geographic: farms, ranches, aquaculture operations, or fish landings that are within 150 miles of our kitchens.
2. Ownership: owner-operated farms, ranches or boats or co-op of owner-operators. Boat sizes vary from species to species. Boats cannot process fish on board other than to bleed and ice their fish at sea.
3. Annual sales volume: no more than $5 million except for co-ops where all members must gross $5 million or less and be a true co-op rather than contractors to a large corporation. (There is no sales limit for a product distributor who merely delivers products from enrolled vendors and can clearly identify sources on their price sheets and invoices.)
4. Certifications: currently, shell eggs are the only protein that is required to have one of the following third-party certifications: Certified Humane, Animal Welfare-approved, or Food Alliance certification. “Local” or “organic” does not qualify a local egg farmer. All seafood must be consistent with a green- or yellow- Seafood Watch rating.

Proteins, including meat, poultry and eggs, dairy and cheese, seafood (medium scale)
Having administered a Farm to Fork program now since 1999, we have come to see that consolidation in the food system has left us with fewer and fewer small-scale owner-operators who produce meat, dairy and seafood proteins in many regions. There are some regional producers, however, whose quality and production practices are exemplary. Their sales volumes and proximity generally exceed the limits of our Farm to Fork Program, so we are expanding the definitions of Farm to Fork to include regional protein producers (only) with these parameters:
1. Geographic: farms, ranches, aquaculture operations, or fish landings that are within 500 miles of our kitchens and who can safely deliver fresh products.
2. Ownership: owner-operated farms, ranches, boats, or co-op of owner-operators.
3. Annual sales volume: no more than 1% of industry leaders’ sales volume for those species. Currently, this translates to an average sales cap of about $40 million annually. See chart.
4. Third-party certifications: required. To demonstrate that the regional producer’s efforts are “appreciably better” than industrial-scale production, liquid and shell eggs, all meats and dairy products that come from regional producers whose gross sales exceed $5 million or are beyond the 150 mile limit must achieve one of the following third-party certifications: Humane Farm Animal Care, Animal Welfare-approved, Global Animal Partnership-level 1 or better, or Food Alliance certification. All seafood must be consistent with a green- or yellow- Seafood Watch rating. A producer who commits to a third-party certification process can be enrolled if they have had an initial consultation with one of the agencies and they commit to completing the process within 18 months. If they do not get certified, they will no longer be considered Farm to Fork suppliers.

Artisan products, including snack foods, granolas, frozen desserts, sushi, coffee, and baked goods
1. Geographic: production facilities that are within 150 miles of our kitchens and at least 50% of the product, by weight, must be sourced from within 150 miles. We have two exceptions to this requirement: coffee must be roasted locally and be of a truly “artisan” nature, and baked goods, including breads, pastries, which must be made and delivered fresh locally.
2. Ownership: owner-operated concerns or co-ops of owner-operators.
3. Annual sales volume: $5 million if a sole proprietorship, farm, orchard, or an LLC.
4. To qualify for F2F sushi, a majority of the fish has to be sourced locally and it must be of
an artisan nature. Local sushi makers do not qualify if they are not artisan.

Requirements for All Producers
1. Traceability: A reliable system must be in place from the farm to our kitchens.
2. Certifications: We currently require no sustainability certifications for small vendors
(see definitions of small and medium-scale, above) but we do encourage producers to share evidence of certifications, integrated pest management or organic practices, and other third-party validated evidence of best agricultural practices.
3. Legal documentation: We require a variety of documents including a certificate of insurance and a W9.","Bon Appetit, when purchasing items (whether on a corporate P card or through an invoice processing interface from their parent company Compass Group) codes their Farm to Fork items with their own general ledger code.
