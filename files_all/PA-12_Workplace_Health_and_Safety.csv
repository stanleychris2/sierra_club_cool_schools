Additionally, in 2012 the Appalachian State Physical Plant created a Safety Committee charged with creating, training and maintaining a culture of safety focused specifically on Physical Plant operational staff. Each professional trade in the organization is represented on the committee. Membership is rotational to provide maximum exposure to safety awareness, and accident avoidance through active service.  The committee convenes monthly. Part of the committee’s work involves physical inspection of one or more of the trade shop areas as a “live training ground” to recognize occupational hazards. All reported accidents within the Physical Plant are reviewed by the committee for educational and preventative purposes. ",http://www.safety.appstate.edu/,--

Drinking Water Quality Testing

McMaster University is committed to ensuring that every person on campus has access to safe drinking water.  In 2010, the University initiated a sampling and testing program to test for the concentration of lead in the drinking water.  This voluntary testing program is now ongoing and buildings constructed before 1990 with original fountains are tested annually. In pre 1990 buildings with newly installed fountains, testing will be performed biennially.

The Office of Environmental Health & Safety provides advice, guidance and resources to the Middlebury community on occupational safety and risk management.  Education and training are key parts of our safety program.  We use a comprehensive training matrix to ensure we meet both regulatory requirements and our own internal standards. Besides regulatory and job-specific safety training, we offer training on many topics, including safe driver training, ergonomics, fire prevention, and free on-site CPR/AED certification training for staff, faculty and students.  

Part of Middlebury’s strong commitment to a safe working environment is emergency preparedness.  Middlebury has established an Emergency Core Team, comprised of senior administrators.  This team is responsible for emergency planning, preparedness and recovery.  This core team has established an Emergency Planning and Preparedness Team, which provides support and resources during an actual emergency.  Middlebury has a state-licensed first responder team made up of staff and student emergency medical technicians who are able to provide emergency medical services to both the campus and the community

The responsibility for Middlebury's safety culture is shared, and requires active commitment from all staff, faculty and students.  We envision continuous improvements to our workplace health and safety program that take it well beyond regulatory requirements.

Two UBC departments provide leadership and expertise in this area – Risk Management Services (RMS) and the Workplace Health Services (WHS) unit of Human Resources.
 
RMS identifies, assesses, and manages all types of risks (strategic, academic, operational, financial, hazard, and reputational) across the University (faculty, research, students, and administration).  RMS services include Enterprise Risk Management: Risk Registers (risk identification and assessment), Occupational and Research Safety, Environmental Impact Mitigation, Emergency Preparedness, Continuity Planning, Insurance Placement, Insurance Claims Management, Loss Prevention, Personal Information Security and Governance, and Internal Consulting Assistance. 
 
WHS includes a Return to Work team that assists employees to return to work after illness and injury, including long-term disability, and to remain at work in modified duties when possible.  The Occupational & Preventive Health unit administers targeted medical services to employees whose work involves risk of exposure to biological, chemical, and physical hazards (e.g., immunizations, occupational health screenings, pregnancy planning resources, etc).  The unit’s Ergonomics function assists with the prevention of musculoskeletal injuries. 
 
While health and safety programs apply to the entire University, departments with higher risk have been targeted in recent years.
• In 2009, UBC initiated a successful pilot project in Building Operations, which saw a 30% reduction in time loss injuries in 2009 as compared to 2008.  This downward trend continues, with a 26% reduction of time loss injuries in 2013 compared to 2012.  Some of the measures that contributed to this noteworthy decrease were active investigations of all incidents, including those that did not cause physical injury, comprehensive reporting of incidents through a dedicated first aid system, facilitated intervention at the earliest possible stage of injury, and greater engagement of direct supervisors.  
• The Abilities Management Program (AMP) within Building Operations has also contributed to the reduction of employee time loss through early intervention, where modified duties for ill or injured employees are offered.  
• In 2010 the successful AMP program was rolled out to the Food Services unit of Student Housing and Hospitality Services, and a 30% reduction in time loss injuries was observed in 2011.  This downward trend continues in Food Services, with a 55% reduction in time loss injuries in 2013 compared to 2012.  
• In 2014 AMP is being expanded to the Housing & Conferences unit of Student Housing and Hospitality Services.",http://www.hr.ubc.ca/health/,"Workplace Health Services, Human Resources

Programs have been in place for a number of decades, but the baseline of 2006 for STARS was selected to fit within the parameter period that aligned with other categories of reporting.","There are multiple health and safety programs on campus, generally administered through Environmental Health & Safety.  EH&S Divisions include:  Environmental Health; Waste Management; Emergency Management; Radiation Safety; Biological Safety; Laboratory Safety; Fire Marshall; Workers’ Compensation; Ergonomics; Risk Management & Insurance and Industrial Hygiene.   The over-arching worker safety program is the Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) and  is the most important health and safety regulation/program on campus, and in California.  The IIPP law is administered by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA).   In short, this law requires employers to establish the following foundation safety program elements that apply to all workers regardless of their particular job duties:

        Ensure that workers are trained in, and comply with, safe work practices
        Inspect for and correct unsafe/unhealthy work conditions as soon as possible
        Maintain documentation of all training and inspections
        Encourage workers to report unsafe conditions (Hazard Reporting Form) without fear of reprisal
        Communicate safety issues in a way that is understandable to all workers
        Report and investigate all occupational injuries

How is the IIPP Implemented at UC Santa Barbara?

As with all campus worker safety programs, the primary implementers of the IIPP are supervisors, faculty and their department administrations (see campus policy #5400).  The role of EH&S is to inform campus administrators of their IIPP responsibilities and to provide them appropriate tools to assist with implementation.  These tools include:

    Each department must have a written IIPP program as required by Cal-OSHA.  Your local written plan should be maintained by your Department Safety Rep within the UCSB Health and Safety Binder.  All employees have the right to see their written program upon request.

    Per Cal-OSHA, each employee must be made aware of their employer's IIPP and their responsibilities under their plan.   The best way to achieve this is to have all employees view the most appropriate online training session:

        Office Supervisors
        Physical Laborer Supervisor
        Non-Supervisor (All employees in non-supervisory role)
        Laboratory Workers (IIPP is covered as part of a broader training module)

Most modules take about 15 minutes to complete and also there is an overview of campus emergency preparedness and response procedures. Within each of the supervisor's modules are the generic forms designed to assist in meeting the training and inspection documentation requirements (IIPP Forms) noted above in #1 - 3.
