The College of Law is at the forefront of public engagement in the legal field through its pro bono activities.  The College of Law strongly encourages its faculty and students to participate in pro bono activities, and it offers a wide array of credit-granting and non-credit-granting pro bono opportunities for students.

Credit-Granting Pro Bono Opportunities.  Law students are encouraged to complete a live-client experience (field placement) before graduation.  Most of the live-client experiences involve traditional pro bono activities by providing law-related service to persons of limited means or assisting organizations that serve such persons. These organizations include the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services, Justice for Our Neighbors, Legal Aid Society, Southern Migrant Legal Services, and Tennessee Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts.

Non-Credit-Granting Pro Bono Opportunities.  Law students have a number of substantial opportunities to perform non-credit granting, law-related pro bono service.  First, a primary purpose of the Student Bar Association (“SBA”) is to facilitate student pro bono opportunities.  SBA officers are required to complete 20 hours of pro bono service each academic year.  Second, all student organizations must complete at least one faculty-approved pro bono project each academic year.  Third, all Belmont Legal Aid Society members may take the Pro Bono Pledge (“Pledge”).  Students who take the Pledge commit to completing 50 hours of pro bono service prior to graduation.  All of the hours must be completed through legal pro bono work.  Last academic year about 35 percent of the student body were members of the Belmont Legal Aid Society.  Using an approach that focuses on building relationships with local partner organizations, the Belmont Legal Aid Society has created multiple opportunities for students to become involved in pro bono work under the supervision of local attorneys.  The most significant of such endeavors are the Magdalene/Belmont Legal Aid Society Clinic, the Waller Lansden pro bono partnership with Belmont Legal Aid Society, the Justice For Our Neighbors/Belmont Legal Aid Society Alternative Spring Break Clinic, the Belmont Legal Aid Society’s clinic and internship partnership with the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, and an emerging street law program.  Over the last two years, more than 30 Belmont University College of Law students have received the highest recognition bestowed by the Tennessee Supreme Court for law students’ pro bono service through designation as a “Law Student for Justice.”  Most impressively in 2014 the President of the Belmont Legal Aid Society was recognized by the Tennessee Bar Association with its Law Student Volunteer of the Year Award.

As such, the major components that are original have exceeded their service life and many of the components rebuilt from other cannibalized parts.  The system has also grown over the years and because of this there are now 5 separate controllers spread out throughout the property that control the entire system.  The controllers also do not communicate with one another or to a centrally monitored system.  This causes problems when there are breaks in the water lines or when water is not needed (rainy days) among other problems. 

Our desire is to go to a “2 Wire System” controlled from one central controller thereby eliminating the 5 dumb controllers and centralizing all 95 valves into a web based controller that uses daily evapotranspiration values provided by NOAA to adjust daily watering needs.  We will also be replacing all valves to in hopes of greatly reducing leaky valves and replacing all sprinkler head nozzles to eliminate fogging or atomizing of the irrigation water as it leaves the sprinkler head.  This will ensure that all water being sprayed out of the sprinkler head will not be blown away or evaporated before it reaches its intended target.

The Fullerton Arboretum goal is to have a 20% savings in water used in the garden for the first year the system is up and running.

The Arboretum needs a plan on how to implement this system to achieve the stated goal.  Existing valves, controllers and heads need to be mapped out.  Then, a plan will be developed on how to best connect the central controller to all the valves (what route should the 2 wire take).

Conducting a sustainability audit of our headquarters:
As a leading environmental non-profit in Orange County we are interested in making sure we are walking our talk and this is something we haven't been able to tackle yet. We thought the group of 9 could divide into sub-teams if that makes sense to carry out the following project:

Audit of our current practices around the following office practices i.e.: 

-Paperless - truly
-Waste
-Materials and practices - ink cartridges
-Packaging
-Electricity usage
-Research and write proposal & budget for suggested improvements:
-Carbon offsets - plants
-True recycling program - process
Recommendations for new purchasing practices for office supplies

Execute:
We would work with the team(s) on a budget and depending on the scale of the improvements, have them install the changes (i.e. colored waste bins or the like) 

A side project of this is to consider how we can use these improvements to educate the public: 

The students would research our current branding and messaging from the website and grounds' signage and propose signage to install with the retrofit to highlight and call attention to our office culture actions in a way that is consistent with our brand. ",--,N/A,--,--

The project also had a very positive outcome engaging residents in Summit Hall via the waste audit, alternative transportation survey, presentations, and programs with the Natural Resources & Sustainability Learning Community in the hall.",True,"The on-campus restaurant Aspen Grille is run in conjunction with the Food and Nutrition Sciences Department and the Hospitality Department. Students combine curriculum and class projects with this unique learning environment to explore topics in sustainable food and dining. 

Positive outcomes for campus include greater understanding among students of the real-life challenges and rewards of operating a sustainable restaurant. The campus community also benefits from having an on-campus restaurant that serves local menu items.

Housing and Dining Services also has an ongoing student-learning laboratory where students learn about food waste reduction through direct contact with the composting and waste-to-energy programs at CSU. Multiple classes each year utilize the in-vessel composting system as a living laboratory, conducting soil samples, making recommendations about recipe mixes, and exploring expansion opportunities.",True,"Sociology 460, Society and Environment, is a course that helps students understand and use sociological principles, concepts, and theories to examine social and
environmental issues, and also to understand and evaluate the application of sociological methods to social behavior and issues, focusing on how application relates to human-environment interactions. The course includes specific course projects which combine CSU's own Center for the New Energy Economy and student involvement in those lobbying efforts related to sustainable energy. The projects include reports and class discussions of CSU's Energy Lobbying efforts to help students better understand policy and decision making. 

Students also participate in data collection and analysis at CSU's prospective Wind Power site. In the last couple of years, students in the Mechanical Engineering department partnered with Juwi Wind to install the tower and they now conduct the data analysis on the site, which will hopefully become a full wind power plant. 
",True,"The Institute for the Built Environment at CSU, part of the College of Health and Human Sciences, has courses and student elective projects which train students on sustainable site evaluation using the campus and local projects as the study area. 

One specific example is a partnership between CSU's Institute for the Built Environment, the Colorado Rockies baseball team, and ARAMARK, the Rockies' exclusive food and beverage vendor.  CSU students helped build the The GaRden at Coors Stadium, which provides herbs and vegetables for ARAMARK to use in Coors Field's Mountain Ranch Club. Institute for Built Environment engaged CSU students in sustainable landscape design, organic horticulture, farm-to-table implementation, and applied sustainability practices. The GaRden was in full operation this summer with a harvest in September.

The Athletics Department also uses graduate students to evaluate and study turf on campus. This often becomes a dissertation/thesis project.
","Purchasing includes students in some of its special committees including the sustainable purchasing committee which implemented the most recent round of green purchasing policies, such as minimum recycled paper content guidelines.

One such example is Ray Browning, a Department of Health and Exercise Professor. His students collected data across campus on long board use and were able to have long board racks installed at strategic points to facilitate more long board commuting. 

The long board racks have had a very positive outcome on campus by reducing long board thefts and also reducing wear and tear to interior spaces by giving students a secure place to keep long boards outside.",True,"Sociology 461 (Water, Society, and Environment), explores and analyzes the sociology of water and how human societies interact with and depend upon water. For the final project in this class, every student or student group must design and begin implementing a waste project on campus. This year class projects included a $100,000 budget proposal to the Facilities Student Fee Fund for more water bottle filling stations on campus, as well as a proposal to the CSU Student Senate (ASCSU) to ban plastic bags on campus.

The projects have a very positive impact on campus by engaging the student government on important waste minimization resolutions and proposals. The projects also connect classroom theory to real-world application by challenging students to identify campus solutions, research feasibility, and submit budget and/or policy proposals to implement the idea.",True,"Aspen Hall, a residence hall on campus, hosts a grey water project. The grey water use system was built in 2007 and has been used for research by College of Engineering gradate students for several years. The system was designed to use UV purification but through testing and analysis by the grad students, the system was switched to chlorine. Current student-led projects, including PhD dissertations, are exploring cost analysis for this system. This semester, Housing & Dining Services has expanded the living lab by hiring a grey water student intern to lead this project. 

The grey water system has had a very positive outcome as the students in Aspen Hall have been actively engaged in the system. Student showers, sinks, and laundry rooms from the first floor provide grey water for the system, which sanitizes and returns the water to toilets in their bathrooms for flushing. The Engineering grad students who operate the system do a program to engage Summit residents each fall to explain the system and then present their data and recommendations to the students in the spring semester. A student survey and info session engage residents and large diagrams explaining the system in the model room engage the thousands of prospective students who tour Aspen Hall each year.",True,"The CSU Community College Leadership program is an academic unit with a wide variety of leadership courses. Among them are EDCL 750 and EDCL 751, Simulated Presidential Cabinet I and II.

Based on this research, the student researcher recommended a definition of sustainable food for Duke University in six product categories. The research also gives broad guidelines for “best practices” in setting and maintaining sustainable sourcing goals in dining services.",True,"A 2014 Master's Project from students at the Nicholas School of the Environment titled ""Duke University Health System Demand Response Prospectus"" explored the profitability and environmental impacts of enrolling Duke University Health System and Duke University into Duke Energy’s PowerShare demand response program.   Student researchers analyzed the economic, environmental, and regulatory feasibility of using Duke University and Duke Medicine emergency generators in a Duke Energy demand response program called PowerShare, more specifically the Generator Curtailment Option. Duke Carbon Offset Initiative credits, a Duke University funding mechanism to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, were also considered as a potential revenue source. In order to conduct the analysis, an MS Excel and Visual Basic model was created to calculate the impacts of enrollment. The model provided to the client was designed to offer an easy user interface to quickly conduct the analyses. It was also specially designed to offer the flexibility to incorporate future changes in the energy market and user preferences. 

The model results indicated that, while feasible, demand response enrollment is not currently attractive from environmental and financial perspectives.  From an environmental perspective, PowerShare is also not a favorable option. Instead of offering a carbon emissions reduction opportunity, PowerShare participation is actually expected to increase the amount of global carbon emissions because Duke University generators emit more carbon than Duke Energy’s natural gas peak usage plants.",True,"In 2014 a student team in the course ENV 245: Theory and Practice of Sustainability completed a client-based project titled ""Natural Resource Management: Save Our Trees! Battling the Cankerworms"".  The project client was Duke's Natural Resource Manager, from the grounds team of Facilities Management at Duke.  Cankerworms are native pests that have reached epidemic levels likely due to a combination of climate change, elderly trees in Durham, and a decline in migratory bird species. To control this issue, citizens put sticky bands on their trees to catch the moths before they lay their eggs. Currently, the city, county and Duke are working together to put on workshops to educate the public, and to get students to help band trees.  

Outcomes of the project included: A strategy for recruiting students to help band trees on campus, and how to reach people in the surrounding community, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the information session, including information about what people knew before the sessions verses after, and if the sessions were helpful. ","A 2013 Master's Project from students at the Nicholas School of the Environment titled ""Sustainable Duke: Procurement & Waste"" explored the effectiveness of Duke’s current sustainable procurement policies and practices through website information review and interviews. Additionally, the students investigated the widely varying sustainable procurement approaches used by thirty other institutions of higher education to evaluate their relative merits.  The student team recommended that Duke move to a more centralized purchasing system and proposed several suggestions to promote sustainable purchasing which have been taken under consideration by the Procurement department at Duke. ",True,True,"A 2014 Master's Project from a student at the Nicholas School of the Environment titled ""An Environmental and Economic Analysis of Converting Duke University’s Police Fleet to Alternatively Powered Vehicles"" analyzed the possibility for Duke University’s Police fleet to serve as a visible platform for demonstrating progress toward the University’s commitment to be carbon neutral by 2024.  By working with the Duke University’s Police Department and Duke’s Sustainability Office, an in-depth analysis of fleet characteristics and officer needs was performed with the intention of identifying suitable alternatively fueled or powered replacement fleet vehicles. By focusing on minimizing lifetime costs, annual fuel costs, and lifetime carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, multiple vehicles and technologies have shown the potential to reduce lifetime fuel costs by over $100,000 and lifetime GHG emissions by 200 tons.  Duke University Police have since begun to alter their vehicle purchases, beginning with an electric recumbent bicycle produced locally from Organic Transit.
",True,"A 2014 Master's Project from a student at the Nicholas School of the Environment titled ""Rethinking the Supply Chain: Uncovering Value with a Zero Waste-to-Landfill Initiative at Wallace Wade Football Stadium"" informed a waste free football program that was launched at Duke in Fall 2014.  The program led to a waste diversion rate of as high as 65% from stadium and tailgate areas during its pilot season. ",True,"In the summer of 2013, Duke started construction on a $9 million reclamation pond that will sit on a 12-acre site on campus. This pond will provide a place for education and research while also providing approximately 100 million gallons of nonpotable water for use in the campus chilled water plant. The pond, started purely as a utility initiative to save potable water in the campus chilled water system, has expanded to an educational and recreational amenity for campus. 

In 2013,  a student team in the course ENV 245: Theory and Practice of Sustainability completed a client-based project titled ""More than Utility: educational, recreational, and research uses of the new Duke Water Reclamation Pond"". Students on this team examined how Duke could balance the potentially competing and interdependent uses of this facility and measure its impact over time. How could Duke balance the ecosystem, educational, recreational and utility aspects of the Duke Water Reclamation Pond? How does a campus create a healthy, functional ecosystem while providing a necessary resource for campus education and utilities? Students researched other similar projects such as the Dells at UVA to see how peer institutions have tackled these questions. They also considered the broader implication of the Pond in Duke’s stormwater management system and the local watershed. Students worked with clients to develop educational materials for the Pond to develop the “story” of this place on campus and to provide insight into the numerous benefits it provides to Duke. The students suggested creating an educational website, producing an informational video, and proposed topics for information signs. They produced a prototype of the website and video.",True,"Student research and course integration has consistently been a part of sustainability planning and governance at Duke University.  For example, in 2014 a student team in the course ENV 245: Theory and Practice of Sustainability completed a client-based project titled, ""What type of innovative carbon offset projects are other ACUPCC schools undertaking and what can Duke University learn from these projects?"". The project's client was the program manager of the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative. The Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative (DCOI) manages multiple projects that generate carbon offsets for the University including a swine waste-to-energy system and an energy efficiency employee benefit program.  DCOI asked the student team to explore potential future projects for the University by researching what other ACUPCC schools have accomplished.  Some questions the students answered include:
1.	What ACUPCC schools are closest to reaching carbon neutrality?
2.	What types of projects are these schools developing?
3.	How could we compare expense, innovation, ease of management, benefits (social, educational, economic)?
By exploring these questions, the ENV 245 team provided valuable information that helped DCOI determine what types of offset projects to pursue in the future. 
",--,,True,"In fall 2014, the Duke Campus Farm served as a client for a student team in the ENV 245: Theory and Practice of Sustainability course.  This project include an additional client, a Duke employee who works in the Health System with a particular interest in the role medicinal herbs can play in health and wellness.  With the guidance of the clients, the student team researched, developed, and cultivated a herb garden at the Duke Campus Farm, with a special emphasis on medicinal herbs. The students determined what kinds of herbs would bring the most benefit to the farm, and best sustain the human, animal, and plant ecologies that the farm supports.  The Duke employee provided guidance to the team in a mutually beneficial relationship that strengthened the knowledge of both the students and employees, plus provided a hands-on outdoor reprieve from daily work and study responsibilities. ",True,"In 2011 and 2012 teams of Master's students from the Nicholas School of the Environment explored the financial viability of investing in Blue Carbon projects to generate carbon offsets for Duke University.  The 2012 project titled ""Business Plan for a Blue Carbon Project"" created a business plan to outline a project for Duke Carbon Offset Initiative (DCOI) to engage in an innovative offset category, Blue Carbon. DCOI’s goal is to assist the university in meeting its 2024 objective of becoming carbon neutral. While the campus has made significant strides in reducing energy use and increasing efficiency, there are some emissions of CO2 and other green house gasses (GHG) that cannot feasibly be eliminated. For these sources, Duke University has begun exploring and developing carbon offset projects across North Carolina. This Blue Carbon project evaluated the potential for DCOI to become involved in a fast developing and newly identified offset site on the NC coastline. DCOI continues to monitor the viability of a Blue Carbon project while comparing the financial investment with offset projects in a variety of other categories. ",True,"A 2014 group Master's Project from students at the Nicholas School of the Environment titled ""Energy Efficiency Carbon Offsets"" with the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative as a client, explored engaging the Duke and Durham communities in developing carbon offsets for Duke University through home energy efficiency projects. The group of three Nicholas School of the Environment Master’s candidates prepared a program for DCOI to implement energy efficiency measures in the homes of Duke community members faculty, staff and students, and generate carbon offsets. This program will aid Duke in achieving its carbon neutrality goal by reducing off campus carbon emissions.

Duke University aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2024 by a combination of efforts to reduce on campus energy consumption and off campus carbon offset generation. One of the offset options that DCOI is evaluating is energy efficiency retrofits in residential buildings leading to indirect emission reductions. The problem we have attempted to address in our project is how Duke University can identify potential carbon offset opportunities in terms of improving energy efficiency in homes and businesses and how these offsets can be verified and quantified.

In order to determine the feasibility of energy efficiency carbon offsets the team started with evaluating data from a similar residential retrofitting project implemented by the City of Durham’s Sustainability Office. The pre and post retrofit energy consumption data from these houses was analyzed to determine the energy savings and resultant carbon emissions reduction. The average emission reduction obtained from this project was then used to determine the carbon price. This carbon price was used to conduct a comparative analysis with carbon prices found in the market, literature and regulations. The second step of the project involved studying energy efficiency retrofit projects that have been undertaken in other regions at various levels and sizes. The last question that this project aimed to answer for DCOI was regarding the suitability of various financing mechanisms for the retrofitting project. In order to address this question a demand assessment survey was designed to determine the willingness of Duke employees to participate in such a program and pay for the retrofits.

This research has led to several ongoing pilot rounds of energy efficiency projects in employee homes.  Read more: http://today.duke.edu/2015/01/homeenergy 
",True,"Through an arts festival focused on environmental issues and direct research and course collaborations, Duke is using the campus as a living laboratory to understand the intersection of environment and the arts.   In 2013 a student team in the course ENV 245: Theory and Practice of Sustainability completed a client-based project titled, ""How can students, faculty, and a local environmental artist produce a piece of sustainable art in a public space on Duke’s campus?"" 

Duke’s commitment to climate neutrality and sustainability includes a promise to take actions that infuse these topics into the curriculum and other educational experience for all students. The Education Subcommittee of the Campus Sustainability Committee wishes to move sustainability more explicitly into disciplines less likely to be traditionally connected with this concept, such as arts and arts education. Therefore, through funding provided by the Duke Council for the Arts, and in collaboration with local environmental artist Bryant Holsenbeck, are Art faculty Bill Fick, a team of students designed “Bottlefall,” a piece of public art made from bioplastic beverage bottles, gained approval for temporary installation on campus, and installed it in the CIEMAS lobby of the Pratt School of Engineering. Creating art with found objects allows many to participate in the creative process by collecting materials that will form the installation. Participants become part of a dynamic, relevant, and contemporary form of art making. Further, making art out of “stuff” we usually throw away or recycle empowers us, both with knowledge and with an intrinsic internal awareness of the volume we produce and the importance of considering relevant behavior change. Finally, materials costs are reduced as a result of sourcing disposed or recycled materials. For this project, the team also developed a handbook documenting useful steps and resources for creating art in public spaces on Duke’s campus.

George Washington University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 13:04:38,shannonross@gwu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,**,True,"Professor Houston Miller has been working with researchers in his laboratory and students enrolled in the University Honors Program Science Proseminar course to design, build, and deploy a greenhouse gas sensor network.  The project’s goal is to engage the local population in climate science by collecting data from individual sensors on a database server where they will be visualized and deployed on the web.  The core of each sensor is a modest cost, carbon dioxide sensor manufactured by SenseAir. A second sensor module measures pressure and temperature.  (In our future development we will explore the use of these two parameters to improve the accuracy and precision of the NDIR sensor beyond the manufacturer’s specifications.)  Both sensors communicate using serial links with a RaspberryPi microcontroller.  The sensor boxes, including a waterproof enclosure, a battery, and material for construction of the interior mounting chassis, and wiring, can be assembled for about $250 each.
This project will be partnered with two DC area start-ups and will have ties to a federal agency.  MapBox is a rapidly growing software house located near Logan Circle that is garnering considerable press in their marketing of highly customizable,  web-enabled, mapping solutions. MapBox is actively expanding into the education arena and GW has met with them to discuss their participation in visualization of GW's data products. Lahetra is a company started in late 2012 that will market spectral simulation software developed by Professor Miller, but with plans to expand into web-enabled sensor hardware.  Many of the ideas for these sensor networks as implemented in the GAZGAGE project are derived from Lahetra UX ideas. The Laser Analytics Lab at GW has a partnership with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for the development of laser-based sensors concentration measurements of carbon dioxide and methane. The group recently was funded through a $980,000 grant from NASA for a project entitled “Characterizing Thawing Permafrost Carbon Emissions: An Integrated Pilot Study in Support of Satellite Evaluation/Design and Earth System Modeling Capabilities.”  The team is combining satellite measurements, climate modeling, and ground-level measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations during seasonal permafrost melting seasons.  The GW group is developing and deploying  a sensor to perform open-path, laser absorption measurements of carbon dioxide and methane - the two most important anthropogenic greenhouse gasses - at  University of Alaska field sites near Fairbanks.  The proposed sensor product is consistent with the educational aims of that collaboration.

Through partnering with other GW stakeholders, the long-term goal of the project is to build 50-100 more units and place them on campus and in DC and metropolitan area elementary schools. In addition to the obvious educational impact of this scheme, a secondary advantage is that elementary schools are widely dispersed across the region that will enable a broad grid for the data visualization product.

The class introduced students to the methods of social science ""field research"" and had them apply it to the issue at hand. Students collected regular data on energy use and recycling in the dorms, conducted detailed student surveyed, implemented randomized control interventions and analyzed the data. Interventions attempted included an environmental awareness campaign, the provision of practical, personalized energy saving tips, and informing dorm residents of how they rank within the dorm in terms of electricity consumption. Professor Ram Fishman and his students found that most students tend to hold strong pro-environmental positions, but that this ideology does not translate into practical action. Students who had stronger environmental positions were using as much electricity, and were equally ignorant of how much they use or how much various appliances consume. Awareness campaigns had no discernible results on either electricity use or recycling, but informing students of their relative ranking was found to have a significant impact on electricity use.  Students collected data on energy use and recycling in the dorms, conducted detailed student surveys, implemented randomized control interventions and analyzed the data.

",True,"Led by Program Director and Associate Dean Adele Ashkar, GW faculty members Lauren Wheeler, Barb Neal and Joan Honeyman are employing a working/teaching approach with graduate students in Sustainable Landscapes to produce a Sustainable Landscape Guidelines document for the Foggy Bottom campus. In 2015 students conducted an in-depth site inventory and analysis of the campus landscape, including the physical condition of the campus as well as social and behavioral aspects of the use of campus outdoor space by students, faculty, staff and neighbors.  The project identifies opportunities for introducing Low Impact Development features (LIDs) on the campus, such as on-site stormwater infiltration and bio-retention systems, pollinator gardens, green streets, edible gardens, and enhanced tree canopy.

In spring 2015, the design team collaborated across multiple disciplines to build a regenerative design approach for the campus landscape. 'Regenerative design’ is one that provides ecosystem services and improves in performance as it grows and matures. Utilizing expertise in landscape architecture, engineering, ecology, horticulture, arboriculture, urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting, soils, as well as benchmarks from the LEED, SITES and LBC rating systems, the design team is creating guidelines for a living system landscape that insures function and beauty and plays a prominent part in GW’s commitment to being a model of sustainability which is being reviewed by university administration in 2016.

",--,,--,,True,"Melissa Perry, Chair of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, in the Milken Institute School of Public Health, worked with an MPH student to study construction safety practices during construction of the new Public Health building.  The study focused on learning more about fall risks over the course of building construction, in order to develop targeted fall-prevention programs.   The student reviewed existing tools for auditing fall safety and elements of fall-safety standards from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  GW developed an assessment tool, the George Washington Audit of Fall Risks (GAFR), with input from safety experts, and refined it following a pilot. After the student attended an OSHA construction-safety course, she began conducting regular site observations to see how different potential hazards arise and how safety practices are used at the various stages of building construction, learning that seemingly minute details actually save lives.  The student visited the building over 35 times to observe if OSHA requirements were adhered to.  Researchers are rarely able to have this kind of access to a worksite for a prolonged period of time, so it provided a unique opportunity to contribute to construction-safety research.  Preliminary findings suggest that the study pinpointed jobs and situations that may pose the greatest risks to construction workers.	",--,,--,,True,"Environmental and Resource Management
Assistant Professor of Geography Melissa Keeley teaches an introductory class in the Environmental Studies Major “Geog 1003 Society and Environment,” in which students investigate Rock Creek Park, a U.S. National Park in D.C. that is adjacent to the GW’s Mt. Vernon campus.  Students study issues such as how to manage invasive species, collect trash, and maintain trees planted (classes planted trees in 2010 and 2014). Prof. Keeley also teaches an upper division level course “Environmental Quality and Management” as a service learning class in which students engage intensively with the Park.  Students examine environmental management issues first hand and often are guided by a National Park Service biologist. They then write a paper summarizing the science surrounding current best management practices for challenges that are selected by the Park Rangers. This is a new type of writing and analysis for students, and provides a valuable input for over-stretched Park staff.  The students, in groups, also plan an environmental management project that will engage the GWU and wider community in Park management. 

",--,"Living laboratories merge academics and campus facilities management to provide students with real-world skills, and for GW, an opportunity to meet its sustainability goals with enhanced student and faculty engagement.  GW sees tremendous potential in the campus living lab concept, since it breaks through the current curricular and operational paradigms to add a new model for both education and sustainability action.  In theory, a living lab is a given place where problem-based teaching, research and applied work combine to develop actionable solutions that make that place more sustainable. Living Labs have the potential to engage students, staff and faculty in citizenship, leadership in sustainability, and to provide a service that benefits the GW campus.  The Living Labs concept speaks powerfully to both sustainability and the GW Strategic Plan and allows us to further enhance our commitment to service and sustainability.

In 2013, an ELA core curriculum class (Voices) helped create and implement the transportation survey. After results were collected, students in a GIS class analyzed the data, looking for patterns that could be used to expand carpooling opportunities. 

Over 2014-2015, GMC aims to involve classes in the research and selection of a carbon offset provider sufficient to meet the College's needs and mission when it completes its greenhouse gas inventory in the summer of 2015. 
",True,"In 2012, the Renewable Energy and Ecological Design program held a block class of 15 credits that built a garage on campus to model energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Olwen Solar Garage boasts a 3.8 kW solar PV array on the roof, a passive heat system from a ground slab, and a large south facing glass wall designed for germinating seeds for the campus farm. The class learned everything from how to design a green building, to how to pour a concrete foundation, to how to install solar. 

In 2013, a weatherization class conducted a thermal audit of the College's Two Editor's Inn, which was paid for by the Student Campus Greening Fund, a group run by students. The audit discovered that approximately $12,000 in renovations could save the college 40% on its energy bills. The Sustainability Office then proposed the project to the Campus Sustainability Council for consideration for green revolving loan funding. The CSC and Cabinet approved the project in the spring of 2014 and the renovation was completed by early summer. As part of a media internship, two students were involved in documenting the renovation process and showcasing the building's features. They produced a video, which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x0LTXh7p40 as well as a professional plaque that will be hung in the living room. Quantitative classes will also be involved in testing the energy efficiency performance of the building, with special attention to the cold climate heat pump that is projected to offset a large percentage of the heating load from the oil boiler. 
",True,"Several related class projects have focused on analyzing the environmental impacts of food purchasing and trying to display those impacts to the wider campus community. In 2012 and 2013, students in a Delicate Balance class created a proposal to install a food dashboard in the dining hall that would display embodied energy, distance shipped and other impacts associated with food being served. The project received funding from the Student Campus Greening Fund in 2013 to hire a local food assistant and build a live food dashboard. The local food assistant began working on a system to track the embodied energy and embodied carbon. A Master's student in sustainable food systems also helped with the project. In collaboration with the director of Chartwells (The dining services provider) the group found a beta tool being tested by the Chartwells company that tracks energy and carbon from food. This tool has the potential to streamline much of the data needed for the project. As of 2014, the director of Chartwells is still working with the tool to understand how to incorporate it into a dashboard. The student-run Slow Foods & Center of the Plate Club have taken on the responsibility of seeing the project completed. 

Meanwhile, in 2013, a class analyzed the embodied energy in specific types of food being served in the dining hall (e.g. chicken, milk, cookies, apple sauce, etc.) and made several displays that can communicate these impacts to patrons. One of the methods displayed the embodied energy in terms of its equivalent of miles driven in a car. 

As an outcome of both of these initiatives, the dining hall now has data they can use to make more informed decisions about food purchasing and display useful metrics to patrons. They want to begin making greenhouse gas mitigation plans for their monthly purchases. 
",True,"Various classes have analyzed the College's fuel purchases and helped to set goals for improvement over the last couple of years. In 2013, students from an energy and environment class analyzed data of fossil fuel use on campus to compare it to the global production rate of renewable energy. They were following the principle outlined in the College's strategic plan that GMC shouldn't use fossil fuels at a rate greater than that at which renewables are being developed. 

In 2013, a natural resources class did a comprehensive environmental, social, and economic analysis of the College's biomass fuel supply to understand the impacts it has. In 2014, another class examined the biomass plant itself and analyzed the various narratives surrounding its use to determine which were accurate and which were not. 

All of the information gathered through these projects is useful to the Sustainability Office, the Campus Sustainability Council and the Sustainability 2020 Steering Committee in making decisions about energy sourcing. 
",True,"For the last three years, the natural areas crew has worked closely with a botany professor to actively control invasive species on campus grounds. Several of these efforts have been associated with environmental science classes. The crew also hosts an invasive species pull during Earth Week to educate the broader campus community about invasives. Every year, a similar educational program is carried out during orientation to teach incoming students about the problem. The result of all of these efforts is a strong ethic on campus to control invasive species and a high awareness among students of the problems with invasive species. As students graduate, others take their places and shepherd the project. ","In 2013, a quantitative environmental analysis class developed an environmental footprint analysis of the aggregate of all college purchases. The analysis covered a range of impact factors such as energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and toxic pollutants. 

In 2014, a group of students in a public policy class used the analysis to help guide creation of a new purchasing policy that would put more weight on higher impact sectors of college purchasing. This purchasing policy was passed by Cabinet in August of 2014. ",True,True,"In 2013, a student helped form a focus group on transportation as a class project. The focus group was tasked by the Sustainability Office and Office of Student Involvement with thinking about how to increase carpooling on campus. The focus group met four times for an hour each over the course of the spring semester. Participants included students, staff, and faculty members. The group helped to design the transportation survey, which included questions about carpooling and roadblocks to taking alternative modes of transportation. Based on the focus group's brainstorming and analysis of the results of the survey, a series of important recommendations were made including which online carpool program to use, how to promote it effectively, and how to shift behavior surrounding other modes of sustainable transportation. The carpooling program Go Vermont was chosen. 

In 2013-2014, a Delicate Balance project, proposed by several students, received $10,000 in funding to build a bike shelter centrally located on campus.

The purpose of the bike shelter is to promote more bicycle use on campus and help to display the bikes available for rental through the free Green Bikes program. 
",True,"In 2013-2014, the student reuse manager in the Sustainability Office carried out a cost-benefit analysis as part of a business class project to analyze the impact of shifting from solitary waste bins to a more streamlined waste station models containing three waste streams in a each location (recycling, composting, and landfill). Meanwhile, the student sustainability office manager and a member of the waste crew started researching various models for the three bin system. They began plugging the numbers into the cost benefit analysis model to run scenarios. 

In 2014, a group of students in an advocacy class built a prototype for the three bin station and displayed it during Earth Week. They received funding for the project from the Student Campus Greening Fund. Two staff in the facilities department helped mentor them through the construction process. The prototype was made from over 90% recycled materials. The students in the Sustainability Office then began an experiment, testing the prototype in one of the residence halls to see if it would change behavior. They collected data on waste disposal amounts before the station was installed and then after it was installed. Results of this effort showed a 39% drop in the trash stream by weight after the waste station was installed. 

In the fall of 2014, students earned another SCGF grant to fund the building of 26 additional waste stations, enough to cover every floor in every residence hall on the main campus in Poultney. The bins are now being constructed with a majority of recycled material by students and staff working together.

Also in 2014, students in an advocacy class launched a campaign to educate the campus about the impacts of paper towel use in the bathrooms. They produced several videos which can be viewed here: https://www.facebook.com/events/668745343192644/. As part of the campaign they held a Go Towelless competition during Earth Week.

Steps included interviews with stakeholders who could potentially be affected by the ban, a water tasting event to see if students could tell the difference between bottled and tap water, production of a video documenting the campaign, and collection of a list of signatures supporting the ban. The campaign was successful and on August 15th, 2014, the College banned the sale of bottled water. The dining services company Chartwells and the vending machine company PepsiCo both signed on to the ban. ",True,"Students have been involved in every step of the development and implementation of GMC's strategic plan, Sustainability 2020. Students served on the committees that decided on goals and later chose metrics for measuring progress. The broader student body voted on the plan as well in 2012.

The student who served on the metrics committee helped organize the event and take notes during the event, while another student spoke at the event giving her perspective on the metrics. A third student helped organize the following community conversation in 2014, where the first results of data collection were shared. This student also spoke at the event, sharing her ideas about how to advance the plan. Several classes were involved in developing portions of the surveys used for data collection. Many other classes were involved in analyzing the data afterwards. The outcome of these efforts is a broader and deeper engagement of the student body in the College's mission and future plans. ",True,"In 2013, a psychology class developed the diversity and inclusion section of the College's social capital survey that was then implemented in 2014. The class discussed the diversity and inclusion goals of the College's strategic plan, Sustainability 2020, and then researched which questions would best measure progress toward those goals. After the survey data were collected, several ELA classes and a leadership class were involved in analyzing and discussing the results in order to brainstorm ideas for increasing diversity and inclusion on campus. Many of these students attended the community conversation in the spring of 2014, where they shared their ideas on big sheets of paper. Those ideas were later transcribed into a list that was emailed to the entire campus community to spur change in relevant areas. The Sustainability 2020 Steering committee also addressed many of the ideas in the list. Additionally, the leadership class produced a separate list of ideas for leveraging change, which were shared with top officials in relevant areas, including the sustainability director.

Before that, MIT had called for student volunteers to shape a culture and create a community for the new dorm before the dorm was opened up. 50 students are part of this ""incubator"" group and called themselves ""the Phoenix group.""

The Phoenix group consisted of 50 undergraduates who in 2010, all moved into a single dorm on campus with the idea of harvesting strong relationships, friendships, and creating a community for the new dorm, Maseeh Hall. The students had a lot of say during the renovations of the new dormitory, including critical decisions on design and decoration of the new building.

The system implemented is as follows: each student gets a green container, they fill it with food. When the container is empty, they drop it off at the cafeteria and when a new clean one. The containers are very durable so are never thrown away- merely reused. The program has been very successful and is now implemented in all the dining halls in the undergraduate dormitories.

Amphibious Achievement teaches valuable lessons in and out of the water: MIT student group works with Boston high school students on academic and athletic skills

Amphibious Achievement is a dual athletic and academic program for urban youth in the Boston area. Our goal is to promote success in and out of the water through a combination of aquatic instruction and college preparatory tutoring. Our approach is to enhance achievement through mind-body learning as well as innovative and high quality mentorship.

. The goal of the program is to promote “success in and out of the water” through aquatic sports, generally inaccessible to inner-city high school youth, and through SAT-based tutoring.

This connection between athletics and academics was what two MIT sophomores, Noam Angrist and Ron Rosenberg, were looking to tap into when they founded Amphibious Achievement. Both Angrist and Rosenberg have been coaches and athletes in crew and swimming, respectively, throughout their lives. As athletes, they learned about the benefits of sport first hand. As coaches, the benefits became even clearer.

“We wanted to latch on to the spillover effects of athletics in a meaningful way,” Angrist said. “We realized, however, that there wasn't a program [at MIT] that provided that outlet. So, we created one.”

They formed task force teams around a variety of issues including, institutional diversity; gender and sexuality; socio-economic status; temporary and unexpected disability; inclusive pedagogy and curriculum; social houses, clubs, and athletics; mental health and the “myth of the normal student.” From these topics they conducted various forms of research (including surveys, interviews, focus groups, quantitative data analysis, and analysis of current handbook and mission statement language.)
 
Students in the Spring 2012 “Models of Inclusive Education” course produced lengthy task force reports. Additionally, the class synthesized their finding and recommendations and presented them at the Spring 2012 Student Research Symposium.  In the Fall of 2012, students took those reports and recommendations and analyzed the work that had already been done, met wherever possible with the prior authors of the task force reports, conducted additional research and created addenda and synthesized the findings of the reports.",True,"The Wellness Committee, which consists of faculty, staff, and students, organized the two day visit of Professor David Levy regarding the integration of contemplative practices with online living.

The last time this partnership took place, two students took on energy-related projects. The first student was an undergraduate and took on the project of Power Down Day energy tracking. She monitored and analyzed campus-wide energy data on Power Down Days (days with targeted educational outreach in reduction) vs other days that did not have the targeted outreach. Because the campus was in partnership with the utility company to reduce energy usage on those days, insight into the success of outreach efforts into reduction was extremely helpful. A graduate student took on the coordination, partnership management, and program development of a pilot project in energy management with a company called I'm in Control. This collaboration led to an electricity competition between the two first year residence halls and overall energy monitoring of those buildings. The pilot was successful and led to an ongoing relationship.

An executive summary is as follows:

Mills College seeks to reduce its carbon footprint by encouraging sustainable practices on campus. While efforts have been made to reduce the footprint caused by utility usage, transportation practices have contributed to a considerable portion of the College’s environmental impact but have yet to be addressed. This policy report provides an analysis of current transportation practices by community members through surveys, parking conditions through spatial analysis using geographic information systems, and services provided by the institution, including the ridership and level of service of the Mills Shuttle and a car share program. Following these series of analyses, several constructed goals, based on research and data collection, are evaluated in the context of cost, feasibility and the approach’s ability to meet the environmental and fiscal sustainability goals and objectives of Mills College. Goals consist of immediate, short term, and long term approaches to be implemented chronologically and following satisfactory data collection and further analysis. This report lays the foundation for research, planning, and implementing long-term strategies that will address the number of private vehicles on campus. It is recommended that Mills College incrementally and chronologically implement each of these approaches in order to see the greatest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

A positive outcome is that Mills College is poised to address transportation at large via policies to increase access to the campus and community, while decreasing cost for transportation. This report will inform any new parking programs that come into place.",True,"Each year, Mills College participates in the National RecycleMania Competition.

Prof. Katie Purvis Roberts, for example, focuses on air pollution, using modern analytical chemistry techniques. This research program not only addresses critical environmental concerns, but also allows undergraduate students the opportunity to perform hands-on research in the laboratory and prepare them for future research opportunities.

Prof. Roberts' state-of-the art air pollution characterization laboratory consists of the following components: 1) A Particle Into Liquid Sampler (PILS) that allows for chemical speciation and mass concentration of ambient particulate matter pollution, 2) a Tapered Elemental Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) for measurement of total particulate matter mass, 3) filter samplers for monitoring the chemical speciation of particles, and 4) analytical equipment such as ion chromatographs and gas chromatography-mass spectrometers.

The College committed itself to expanding in an environmentally responsible fashion and proving that green blueprints could shrink carbon footprints. The 2003 Housing Master Plan proposed new residence halls designed with both architectural flair and eco-friendly features.

The first phase of Pitzer’s Residential Life Project was so green it won gold, earning top marks from the US Green Building Council (USGBC). Opened in fall 2007, the new residence halls of Phase I—Atherton Hall, Pitzer Hall and Sanborn Hall—received USGBC’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification.

They source local foods and support farmers in our region. Their website notes:
According to the Worldwatch Institute, in the United States, food now travels between 1,500 and 2,500 miles from farm to table, as much as 25 percent farther than two decades ago. That shipping and trucking does incredible damage to the environment in the form of global warming and air pollution. Eating locally also helps reduce the immense amount of non-renewable resources wasted in transporting food. Fuel conservation isn’t only about driving less: it’s also about buying things that don’t travel half-way across the globe.

In addition, local farmers, who use more sustainable growing practices, act as stewards of the land. By buying from local growers you help support sustainable farming practices that nourish and replenish the local land rather than stripping it. You have the power to ensure that the food you buy is produced in a manner that steers away from pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics.

The purchases you make can have a profound impact on your community. The family farm is dying and when the family farm dies so too does our agricultural heritage. However, if you eat locally then you are simultaneously investing in your own community and helping to preserve local farmers and artisans ensuring their traditions continue. If you buy local, you are helping to ensure that we can savor these authentic flavors in the future.

In addition, Pitzer students run the Grove House kitchen and Shakedown Cafe.

The Shakedown Cafe is a student-run restaurant, located on the second floor of the Gold Student Center (GSC) at Pitzer College. We strive to incorporate locally-grown, organic produce into our menu. Additionally, we provide a space for the community to meet, enjoy a delicious meal, do homework, listen to music, play games, and share talent.

Our Philosophy
From the “Shakedown Manifesto” written by founders Fred Beebe, Alden Towler, Josh Lipkowitz, Dane Pollock, and Gabriel Guerrero.
“The Shakedown is about reconnecting people with their food.  The Shakedown is about showing people that beauty that lies within the act of planting a seed that has been saved for generations upon generations, taking care of that seed as it germinates and grows into a plant, and then harvesting the fruit that the plant has reaped.  That fruit is purchased at a fair price from a farmer who worked under fair and humane conditions and turned into a delicious creation served at The Shakedown made with love by our staff.  That fruit then serves the catalyst to a great conversation, to a beautiful meal between friends, colleagues, and loved ones.  Over that meal, people will come together and share their thoughts and experiences, they will listen to music, they will look at art, they will get some work done, they will read a book, or they might partake in any number of activities and it all starts with that simple seed grown on a piece of land that has been cared for with love by a farmer.”",True,"One way in which the campus is utilized as a living laboratory for Energy is through the PowerDown energy reduction competition (part of Campus Conservation Nationals) that takes place every year between the Claremont Colleges.  Last year's competition saw Pitzer students reduce their energy consumption in the residence halls by 6.4%.

The campus is also currently finishing up a comprehensive energy audit as well as a solar master plan to figure out ways to further conserve energy and move towards renewable/sustainable sources of power. Our goal is to reduce our carbon emissions (based on 2014 data) by 25% by the end of 2016.",True,"The Garden Club utilizes the campus as a living laboratory for Grounds via the student-lead organic garden.  The garden is a completely student-operated space; garden club members are responsible for planting, watering, weeding, and harvesting.  Garden club members also are responsible for composting some of the food waste that is generated by the dining hall and other student-run campus cafes.  
",,--,True,"One way in which the campus is used as a living laboratory for Transportation is via the Green Bike Program (GBP).  The GBP is a student-run organization created to promote cycling, bike safety and sustainability at The Claremont Colleges and the surrounding community.  Founded in an attempt to counter Los Angeles’ renowned car culture by encouraging people to use bikes, the GBP accomplishes its goals through the reuse of old bikes and parts along with the organization of cycling events. The GBP also gives community members free access to bicycles, tools, repair lessons.

The College also has taken innovative steps on an administrative level to limit the number of cars arriving on campus.  Freshmen and sophomores are prohibited from bringing cars to campus, and the TRIP program provides a monetary incentive to employees to use alternative modes of transportation to commute to/from campus.
",True,"Examples of the campus being utilized as a living laboratory for Waste include the ReRoom Initiative and the College's composting program. The student-lead ReRoom Initiative aims to reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill during the annual move-out.  To accomplish this, ReRoom staff accept donations of commonly used residence hall items (refrigerators, microwaves, school supplies, books, etc.) and hold these items in storage until the next fall, where they are resold to incoming and returning students.  This has the added benefits of providing low-cost alternatives to  buying these items new.  Students are also able to learn more about Waste by participating in the College's composting program.  Students may participate either by depositing their food waste from meals in the dining hall's food waste receptacles, or by joining the Composting Club and composting food waste at the campus garden.

Removing Turf
0.7 acres of the College’s 3.5 acres of turf have been removed.  Affected areas include Chung Field, the turf area south of the basketball court, the turf area immediately north of the McConnell Center concrete apron, and the turf area surrounding the ParFitness station east of the McConnell Center.

Parklet Project: The project initiated as a collaboration between the SoMa EcoDistrict (PSU is w/in this district), PSU’s School of Architecture and Institute for Sustainable Solutions. Designs were developed in a partnership between the School of Architecture and SoMa EcoDistrict, which received approval from the City of Portland in May, 2014 to become the first public parklet in the city. The SoMa Parklet is a project to create an attractive public gathering place for downtown Portland’s South of Market Street (SoMa) neighborhood. A parklet is a small space serving as an extension of the sidewalk to provide amenities and green space for people using the street. Our parklet design carefully incorporates environmental considerations, from stormwater management to the use of reused and sustainable materials. It also incorporates different seating styles — low benches with tables, high tables with stools, and high-back benches for longer term seating options. The parklet’s plants were chosen to complement the appearance of the adjacent food carts and feature a series of species including tall plants and low ground cover with different blooming seasons to create a seasonally changing landscape within the parklet. Most importantly, this community gathering space is made for everyone, being both ADA-compliant and wheelchair accessible.

The Hand Dryers project was designed to persuade Facilities Services Staff that Dyson Airblade Handdryers were a more environmentally-considerate and energy-efficient choice for SFU, and to try to have all paper hand-towels and hand dryers replaced on campus.    After leaving Change Lab, this student submitted their project idea to SFU’s annual Kill-A-Watt Contest, and was selected as a winning entry. When the bathroom renovations were undertaken on the Southwest AQ bathrooms in the fall at SFU, Dyson Airblade Hand-dryers were installed. Upon following up with Facilities Services about the effect of this student’s work on the choice to install the specific hand-dryer model recommended by this student, the following excerpts were reported to us via email by a staff member at Facilities Services: 

""I think it would be fair to say that the student's advocacy played a significant role in moving into action what previous proposals had failed to do, likely because the student actually engaged in discussion with facilities staff.""

""Implementing any change is definitely challenging! I believe that when students lobby for the change in a thoughtful way backed by research and case studies, it can be very powerful to drive action [and] staff use the student request as justification for the change.""

The EE Dialogues were a project designed by a project team of 6 of the students, through the Change Lab program, which aimed to: 

• promote the joy of learning and teaching within the SFU community by getting students excited about and engaged in their education;

• help build student-professor relationships that address and reimagine conventional power dynamics;

• prepare students for a world that demands ecological consciousness and dynamic problem solving skills;

• promote, share, and connect with existing opportunities in EE while envisioning new possibilities for SFU. 

In total, 21 faculty members, 19 staff and administrators and 45 students attended the two Dialogue sessions, participating in a combined 3 hours of dialogue and activities.  

The Dialogues generated a number of meaningful recommendations, which were synthesized as part of the data informing the Final Summary Report of the Experiential Education Project. 

In regards to their impact, the project team concluded that: “The Experiential Education Dialogues were envisioned as a first step towards revitalizing and revolutionizing learning at SFU. By connecting interested members of the SFU community and engaging students to take a more active role in their education, we aimed to foster a network of students, staff, administration, and professors dedicated to the promotion of EE. The dialogues made great strides towards this end, bringing together a diverse set of actors for an inspiring two sessions, and highlighting once again that the climate is right for continued action and progress in the area of EE at SFU. Moving forward, the recommendations that came out of the dialogues represent the next steps in creating, promoting, and strengthening experiential education at SFU. Importantly, we must remember that the change we are seeking is a process and one likely to be gradual. As such, perspectives that acknowledge longer timelines in relation to the transitory nature of the student population are crucial to ensure the success of what can only be regarded as the next great step in the evolution of post-secondary education,”.

Kendall Foundation has bolstered sustainability efforts at Smith. The $168,751 grant supports the ongoing efforts of Smith College Dining Services to develop sustainable, local and healthy food practices.  The grant also allowed for the creation of a new Dining Services position.  The Sustainability and Culinary Manager focuses on connecting to local farms and food sources to bring more local food into Smith’s kitchens.
Efforts supported by the grant include:
• Hiring additional staff and student workers to establish sourcing protocols aimed at encouraging the use of locally grown produce and locally raised meat and fish.
• Evaluating Smith’s student-run community garden, which currently lacks a long-term planting and business plan, in an effort to guarantee future sustainable success.
• Conducting an evaluation of current menus to determine beef usage that will inform Smith’s practices regarding purchasing local and/or grass-fed beef.
• Identifying local products that can be processed, chopped and/or frozen, via the Western Massachusetts Food Processing Center, and then stored for future use.
Dining services’ current sustainability practices include: purchasing cage-free eggs, fair-trade coffee, local yogurt and granola.
About 22 percent of Dining Services’ food purchases are from local, sustainable sources, and humane or environmentally friendly sources, according to Dining Services Director Kathy Zieja. “We would like to increase that number,” she says. “Currently, we purchase as much local fruit and vegetables as is seasonally possible from about 10 to 15 farmers and producers in our Massachusetts valley and in southern Vermont. The Kendall Foundation grant will allow us to explore further opportunities.”
Students are also heavily involved in projects to improve sustainability in Dining Services.  As part of her work for the Sustainable Food Concentration in 2014, a student worked with Dining Services to revamp their website to include information to further engage the campus in understanding the issues associated with sustainable food, and where their food is sourced. She has been supporting Dining Services by researching how to expand their offerings of local and sustainable food, and has also developed informational brochures and other educational outreach material. 
Two students also conducted an evaluation of purchases in two kitchens based on the Real Food Challenge.  The Real Food Challenge evaluates foods based on several characteristics including humane treatment of animals, fair treatment of laborers, locality, and ecology.   The students’ preliminary study concluded that 9% of food purchased in the two studied kitchens met the requirements of “real food.” 
Students have also established a Smith College chapter of the Food Recovery Network.  These students work with kitchen staff to save and package leftover food so that healthy, edible food does not become compost or trash.  Students then transport the food to a local community center where it is served to those in need.  In the Fall 2014 semester alone the students recovered 1,611 pounds of food.

It is hoped that blight resistant chestnut hybrids will eventually be available in large enough numbers to begin restoring the American chestnut into natural forests. With this prospect in mind, the Center for the Environment, Ecological Design and Sustainability is sponsoring and supporting a series of experiments at the MacLeish Field Station with the goal of testing methods of restoring American chestnut hybrids into various natural forest communities of southern New England. These experiments include an investigation of chestnut seed germination ecology in a natural setting, the growth response of seedlings to forest gaps of varying size, the competitive interactions of chestnut with other native hardwoods, and an examination of the chestnut's response along a soil moisture gradient. 

The chestnut project is designed to provide several levels or access points for student involvement. For example, the very interested student could use the chestnut project to develop her own one- to two-semester research project under the umbrella of the broader experiment, enabling her to work at the MacLeish Field Station and potentially develop connections with the American Chestnut Foundation at state and national levels. For students with less time to commit to an independent project, but with strong interests in conservation, this project has the potential to provide a larger number of students with the chance to work on American chestnut conservation for a day.

",True,"The Office of Sustainability works with the Woods Institute for the Environment to organize a class, last offered in Winter Quarter 2012, entitled “Creating a Green Student Workforce to Help Implement Stanford’s Sustainability Vision.” The class is jointly offered through the Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Systems departments and focuses on practical training on energy efficiency and conservation measures for students to implement across campus. The course description reads, “Examination of program-based local actions that promote resource conservation and an educational environment for sustainability. Examination of building-level actions that contribute to conservation, lower utility costs, and generate understanding of sustainability consistent with Stanford's commitment to sustainability as a core value. Overview of operational sustainability including energy, water, buildings, waste, and food systems. Practical training to enable students to become sustainability coordinators for their dorms or academic units.” An example of a class project in 2012 was to audit and install smart power strips and programmable timers in the Blume Earthquake Center on campus. The Office of Sustainability also leads a training entitled “Sustainable Office Spaces” that is open to students, staff and faculty that trains attendees on energy efficiency measures that they can take in their offices, workspaces, or dorms. This training is offered twice each fall as part of the university’s Cardinal Green Buildings campaign. For more information on this training, visit: http://sustainable.stanford.edu/trainings. ",True,"Stanford engages students in its landscape and grounds in several ways. First, Stanford offers several classes at the Stanford Community Farm, which is located on campus. For instance, in “Principles and Practices of Sustainable Agriculture,” offered through the Earth Systems and Environmental Earth Systems Sciences departments, students engage in field-based training in ecologically sound agricultural practices at the Stanford Community Farm. Projects and coursework revolve around working with a team to apply sustainable farming techniques to an independent section of the farm, with each team held accountable for the crops it grows. The food produced through this class is regularly donated to Stanford Dining, where it is used in meal production in dining halls.
Secondly, Stanford constructed teaching gardens in the recently completed Science and Engineering Quad. These gardens mirror the landscaping of Stanford’s original main quad, but were designed specifically as teaching gardens for the interdisciplinary staff residing in each of the four quad buildings to utilize during their classes. Each of the four gardens has a different theme: plants used for dyes, medicinal plants, local and drought tolerant plants, and plants traditionally used by the Ohlone tribe in the Bay Area. Additionally, Stanford’s Building and Grounds Maintenance department constructed a separate Waterwise Demonstration Garden on campus that serves as an example for students and local residents of how to employ alternatives to thirsty residential landscapes. It also has a water meter on display to illustrate its low water consumption and showcases drip irrigation and California native plants. More information on the Waterwise garden is available here: http://bgm.stanford.edu/groups/grounds/special/waterwise.

The structure of these sustainability promotions needed to be reevaluated in order to increase the overall visibility of sustainability on campus and streamline the participation process for the campus community. In order to plan for a new campaign structure, it was necessary to learn what types of incentives were most appealing to students. To study this, a student intern in the Office of Sustainability prepared and distributed a survey for students to determine what types of rewards motivated them most, from gift cards to apparel to cash rewards. After receiving a couple hundred responses, the student intern analyzed the results and submitted recommendations to the Office of Sustainability. Based on the positive outcome of this student’s work, she then helped the Office of Sustainability reorganize the incentive structure for sustainability campaigns, resulting in a high level of success of subsequent campaigns, such as the Cardinal Green Buildings campaign and the Recyclemania competition. 
Additionally, to aid in planning for Stanford’s response to the California drought in 2014, a team of graduate students worked with Residential & Dining Enterprises staff to conduct a study of the effectiveness of various types of signage in promoting the washing of full loads of laundry in Stanford’s undergraduate laundry rooms. This study provided results that will be incorporated into R&DE’s overarching water conservation strategies and plan in the 2014-15 academic year.
Finally, elected students serve on the Sustainability Working Group (SWG) committee, which prepares policy and program recommendations to advance and implement sustainability practices on campus. As with all members of SWG, these students are asked to provide input into key sustainability challenges on campus and are tasked with action items from the committee when appropriate.

Research methods include mind-mapping, literature reviews, interviews, observation, photo-documentation, text analysis, material analysis, and storytelling. The student research culminated in a print-on-demand book.  Several of the students recommendations are being considered by the campus, including a green roof at the Haggerty Terrace.  The class research enabled campus administrators to connect with commuter students, a less organized constituency, and to learn about their opinions about parking policies and locations on campus which have the potential to lead to a reconfiguration of parking lot assignments on campus.",True,"Michael Sheridan worked with two students over the summer of 2014 to conduct a historical price analysis of local and national food vendors on the New Paltz campus. This involved extensive data entry of invoices from every food service venue on campus.

The findings will be used to inform local food procurement policies at SUNY New Paltz.",--,,True,"During the summer of 2014, Professor Emerita Carol Rietsma and Assistant Professor Eric Keeling conducted a campus tree survey with students, inventorying all trees on campus. The database will be made available to all campus users, including facilities staff, students, and faculty, especially in the biology department.  Professor Keeling used it to improve a tree identification activity in his undergraduate Ecology course (BIO340) by designing a tour through campus highlighting important native species. The trees became important “teaching trees,” allowing handy comparison between the subtle characteristics of species that are difficult to differentiate.   In his Plant Ecophysiology course (BIO425), he plans to use the database in a similar manner to locate important tree species for phenological observations.  The database will be valuable more generally for identifying  and cataloging “trees of special value” on campus that would include “teaching trees” as mentioned above, but also other notable specimens, for example, particularly large or old trees.  Additionally, the database may be used to inform decisions about future plantings on campus, in order to fill gaps in the campus collection of living trees.  ","A team of faculty, staff, and students formed the Hydration Committee in 2012, to research ways to transition the campus from bottled water to campus-wide water bottle refill stations within 2 years. The committee researched and found a cheaper and more energy-efficient alternative to Elkay-brand hydration stations. Student Annie Courtens took a lead in this initiative and compiled report of recommendations that was presented to the Board of Directors of Campus Auxiliary Services and Facilities Management. The solution involved retrofitting existing fountains with gooseneck spouts attached to the fountain to provide upright bottle filling.

The project team expects a fall 2015 launch.",True,"In the fall of 2014, students Molly Poniatowski and Jacob Yoder under the supervision of Campus Sustainability Coordinator Lisa Mitten conducted the campus's first food waste audit at the Backstage Cafe at Parker Theater.  They identified how much waste is generated in one day at the dining facility and how much material could be diverted from the landfill if recycling was expanded from bottle collection only to single stream and re-consumer and post-consumer composting collection was added to this facility.  Their waste audit report made recommendations to the College on how to achieve zero waste goals at this dining location and others.
",True,"The SUNY New Paltz Water Quality Action Team is a multidisciplinary team of students and professors researching the infamous SUNY New Paltz Gunk, a chain of ponds which forms the start of the Saw Mill Brook River.  As part of a larger project, the team is monitoring the water quality and quantity leaving campus. The team has installed a water quality buoy in the large pond. The buoy, powered by solar panels, contains several different sensors that continuously monitor water quality in the large pond at SUNY New Paltz (i.e., The Gunk). Every 10-15 minutes, the data is transmitted via cell phone signal to http://buoy.newpaltz.edu
The buoy monitors pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. Aquatic ecosystems have daily cycles and without taking frequent measurements, these cycles and changes as a result of smaller rain events will be missed.

In 2013, faculty from Art, Biology, Business, Education, EGS, and Sociology researched a variety of green infrastructure practices in place at SUNY New Paltz to improve watershed resiliency as a climate adaptation strategy to reduce localized flooding and improve water quality. A symposium and poster session for this SUNY New Paltz Watershed Project was held on campus in fall 2013. 

Resulting projects on campus include: 
 -  Rt. 32 Lot: a permeable pavement expansion of the largest parking lot on campus was installed. 
-   Lenape Residence Hall Bioswales: a bio retention area with small swales was installed adjacent to a residence hall.
- Crispell Hall Bioswale: a bioswale was installed at one of the most heavily traversed locations in the heart of campus.

This garden will grow plants known to produce paper-making fibers, as well as experimental plants including native and gathered invasive species. In our rooftop-garden research, we will also test plants for their strength, coloring capacities, and production.  Since paper has been historically a fundamental substrate to printmaking, the goal of this research is to make the entire practice, from planting the seeds to processing the paper pulp, become integral to their education and research program—from seed to sheet, from pigment to inks.
Printmaking studio also engages in the following sustainable practices:
-	Recycle rags: rags are monthly picked up by outside vendor to be cleaned and new batch of cleaned rags is delivered
-	Mordants are chemically “upped” weekly: acids are tested and weaker acids are strengthened weekly to avoid waste.
-	Solvents: Jill Parisi introduced a solvent box where filtered solvents circulate. Weekly solvents are added providing no waste and air control.
-	Mixed inks are kept in ziplock bags and plastic containers and reused.
-	Grease is reused
-	Traps guarantee that waste is controlled.


In Spring 2013, Graphic Design Professor Amy Papaelias, had students in the course ARS308 Type & Image work with the campus sustainability committee to create posters educating the community about sustainability related issues on campus. Posters encouraged the community to bike to campus, use reusable bottles instead of plastic water bottles, purchase goods from the farmer's market on campus, etc. Several of these posters were printed and used on campus.


In the course Disability Studies in Art Education (ARE 305), Art Education Professor Alice Wexler teaches  Universal Design, which is about accessibility beyond accommodation--which means that it is a forethought, not an afterthought. In the fall of 2014, the class constructed as an ""art intervention"" a cardboard wheelchair accessible ramp on the steps leading to LC. Also, one student used a wheelchair to research what is and is not accessible. It took her 10 minutes to reach the bottom of the steps by going in a circuitous route (finding ramps and power doors). This research uncovered a less accessible area of campus. One of the students led the research and documented it with a film and notes from a wheelchair.",--,--

This article studies how many university campuses in the United States are working toward their sustainable goals by adopting energy or green building policies, which require Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certification for new construction and major renovation projects. Because LEED certification heavily relies on whole building energy simulation to demonstrate building energy performance improvement, it is often assumed that the finished buildings will achieve the predicted level of energy efficiency. This paper presents a study that compares the energy model predictions with actual energy performance of three LEED buildings on a university campus. The study shows that one of the campus LEED buildings consumed twice the predicted energy usage while causing a high level of occupant dissatisfaction. Further investigation reveals a variety of contributing factors for these issues and provides insights to improve green building policy and practice. Not only are the research findings important for this particular campus (Ohio State University) on its way to sustainability, they also have widespread ramifications for other university campuses. 

One positive outcome is that the research identified problem areas with the performance of several LEED certified buildings on campus, and the university was able to address many of these complications by improving the Procedures in our current Green Build and Energy Policy.

The UBC Food Systems Project (UBCFSP) (http://sustain.ubc.ca/campus-initiatives/food/ubc-food-system-project) is a collaborative, cross-campus SEEDS project initiative that brings together partners in academics, operations, and research to collectively advance UBC’s food system sustainability. Campus food system priorities are identified annually through a UBC Food Systems Project Committee. Key project outcomes include a campus SEEDS Food Action Planning document, UBC Sustainable Campus Food Guide, and ongoing research projects aimed to increase the sustainability of all aspects of UBC’s food system from production, processing, distribution, consumption to waste.   

Key project outcomes included the establishment of new food system targets for the AMS Lighter Footprint Strategy, energy modelling to develop the most sustainable food truck, and increasing healthy and sustainable food options on campus.

Other key outcomes in 2013/14 was a 3-year partnership formed with SEEDS and the UBC Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm on the “Scaling Up: Bringing Local to a Global Campus” institutional food procurement project.  Leveraging its experience as a working farm on an urban campus, the Centre’s Farm-to-Institution Programs develops lessons and dissemination material that equip growers, suppliers, and institutions to initiate farm-to-institution partnerships, thereby directly helping the development of policies and practices to increase local, sustainable food procurement. Additionally, the Centre is engaged in developing a pioneering farm-to-healthcare local food procurement model, bringing local, sustainable, healthy food to UBC Hospital patients.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), emissions from one hour operation of the lawn mower are equivalent to the emissions produced by eleven cars driven for the same amount of time. These pollutants, exposed to sunlight, will drive a process that generates ozone, a compound known to cause respiratory ailments. The NOx-Out device is capable of reducing the pollutants emitted from these off-road engines with an affordable and sustainable unit. The unit is comprised of a filter, urea reservoir, and coated zeolite catalyst, and the NOx-Out device is able to mimic the reactions found in a selective catalytic converter while operating with the inexpensive materials, zeolite, copper, and urea. Along with pollution, the NOx-Out device is also capable of reducing the sound and smell emitted by off-road engines.  Current designs and materials of the filter and urea are being investigated to optimize their duration and elongate its sustainability and there will be ongoing tests to determine the most efficient design for the NOx-Out device. As an example, we are currently testing the effectiveness of Cu-ZMS-5 catalyst impregnation onto a honeycomb cordierite substrate. Using a coated substrate will increase the contact time of exhaust to catalyst in the device, further improving reductions.

UC San Diego students are working with Professor Jan Kleissl from the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering to build and deploy Sky Imagers, ground-based short term solar forecasting system that provide solar plant operators and electric system operators with information about upcoming adjustments to power output. Clouds are tracked through the sky and shadows are projected to the ground where the fluctuating solar power output may impact voltage regulation equipment. This technology helps anticipate and mitigate such impacts and facilitates the expansion of solar power.  UC San Diego’s undergraduate and graduate engineering students oversaw the instrumentation development from concept to a pre-commercial device with deployments at UC San Diego, LA, Maui and, potentially, Spain.  UC San Diego Rady School of Management MBA students joined this living laboratory by supporting the commercialization of university research. They solicited feedback from customers and worked with scientists and engineers to develop plans for commercialization of their research.  The Sky Imager has already received accolades and has won a Department of Energy award.  


Weather Monitoring Stations

UC San Diego students have designed, built and deployed a network of five weather-monitoring stations as a key step toward helping the university use ocean breezes to cool buildings and identify the sunniest rooftops to expand its solar power. Two professors at the Jacobs School of Engineering, Jan Kleissl and Paul Linden, and two from the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), Doug Palmer and Bill Hodgkiss, are mentoring graduate and undergraduate students on the project.

Additional projects include students working with professors and researchers to develop innovative ways to save energy on campus: 

- Sleep Server is a project of the UC San Diego Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory at the Computer Science and Engineering department.  Computer scientists partnered with Microsoft Research to create a plug-and-play hardware prototype for personal computers that induces a new energy saving state known as “sleep talking.” Normally, PCs can be in either awake mode—where they consume power even if they are not being used—or in a low power sleep mode—where they save substantial power but are essentially inactive and unresponsive to network traffic. The new sleep talking state provides much of the energy savings of sleep mode and some of the network and Internet-connected convenience of awake mode. The primary researcher who developed the SleepServer is Yuvraj Agarwal who began his research as a UC San Diego computer science Ph.D. student. UC San Diego computer science and engineering professors Rajesh Gupta and Stefan Savage served as his advisors. Agarwal now advises several graduate and undergraduate students on this efficiency project as it is being deployed and monitored UC San Diego.

For the treatment portion of this experiment, measurements were taken at Portola Dining Hall and DLG Dining Hall every weekend for four weeks and each dining hall was given either environmental signage or “social validation” signage. At the end of this four week period, the type of signage at each dining hall was swapped and data was then recorded for another four weekends. Their conclusion was mixed; while food waste was reduced by both forms of signage at DLG Dining Hall, food waste was not reduced by either form of signage at Portola Dining Hall. Lack of data from a third dining hall as a true control and lack of knowledge of more subtle differences between dining halls, both largely a result of limited time, may have contributed to their unclear results. However, an important outcome of this research is that there is the potential to affect food waste at campus dining halls with effective signage.",True,"A UC-wide Carbon Neutrality Initiative was established in 2013 by UC President Janet Napolitano.

The objective of this project is to create strategic relationships on campus, identify opportunities and roadblocks, build a strategic investment strategy by improving decision-making as it pertains to capitally intensive energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. By developing a Life Cycle Cost Analysis tool, this group project will create a framework for achieving carbon neutrality at UCSB that is timely and effective. Included in the development of this tool, UCSB's carbon neutrality group will:

-Assess the efficacy of various technologies including, but not limited to: energy efficiency; on-site and off-site renewable electricity generation; alternatives to natural gas for heating such as heat pumps and bio-methane generation from organic waste; system integration and load balancing, including the need for electrical and/or thermal energy storage;
-Estimate the costs and developing financial models that account for up-front capital investments, the costs of borrowing, and the savings and payback time due to reduced utility expenses. Where appropriate, the project should also weigh the pros and cons of UCSB funded investments versus the use of third party providers who will build and operate a facility (e.g. a solar array) and lease the power to UCSB;
Assess the impact of UCSB, local, state and federal policies such as the limitations on borrowing by UCSB, and the current lack of direct access to wholesale electricity markets;
-Estimate the optimal balance between on-site investments and off-site investments in collaboration with University of California, Office of the President (UCOP) and other campuses;
-Estimate the optimal balance and deployment schedule of various technologies, systems & behavioral approaches necessary to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2025. This should include the projected evolution of technologies & costs, anticipated changes in state & federal policies, planned growth of the campus, and the possible need to purchase offsets.  Due to uncertainties, it may be necessary to develop more than one scenario.

At this point, the project group has developed an understanding of the campus environment, identified the feasible and effective technologies, built campus-wide relationships and created a UCSB-specific Life Cycle Cost Analysis tool. In addition, they intend to run several projects through the LCCA tool and write a report that explains all of the initiatives described above in addition to the results from running select projects through the LCCA tool.

The group utilized several different forms of assessment and survey to identify and track expenditures, including Economic Input-Output LCA (EIO-LCA). EIO-LCA  uses an organization’s expenditures along with data from national economic and environmental databases to determine the environmental impacts of the products it purchases.  UCSB spends $70 million on goods and services. In 2013 UCSB switched to a centralized online purchasing system called Gateway. Gateway is an exceptional source of purchasing data, and also allows for opportunities to easily affect purchasing habits and the accessibility of sustainable products. Additionally, the group gathered information regarding the percentage of purchasers whose purchasing decisions are influenced by sustainability; of respondents, 81% reported that sustainability influences their decisions. This suggests that higher accessibility to sustainable purchasing options through Gateway could lead to more sustainable purchasing.

",True,"Co-Generation Plant 

UConn's state-of-the-art Co-Generation Facility opened in February 2006, replacing several oil-fired utility boilers and enabling the University to meet its own energy needs at the main campus.

The Co-Generation Plant, which houses the cogeneration technology, is located centrally on the UConn Storrs campus.

Co-Generation is defined as the sequential production of both electrical or mechanical energy and useful thermal energy from a single energy source. This allows over 80% of the fuel energy to be harnessed, versus 33% from a conventional electric power plant.
The Co-Generation facility provides a two-fold reduction in emissions: 

1.	Natural gas, a cleaner burning fuel, is used by the facility to generate electricity and steam for heating and evaporative cooling.
2.	Also, the inclusion of steam production in the process removes the need to construct separate steam-production facilities that would burn their own fuel and have their own emissions.

Most power plants on the electric grid are considerably less efficient than cogeneration facilities because they do not capture and utilize the steam for heating and cooling. Also, “distributed generation,” like UConn’s 25 MW Co-Generation facility, prevents the efficiency loss and congestion that occurs during transmission and distribution of electricity from the point of generation to distant electricity customers.

Due to these features, the UConn Co-Generation facility reduces carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) emissions by an estimated 30,000 tons each year versus emissions from fossil-fueled power plants serving the regional electric grid.

• The undergraduate Urban Forestry FOR4090 class is in the process of completing an assessment of UF's urban forest ecosystem.  As part of their assessment, they have used monitoring plots and models to estimate carbon offsets, invasive tree abundance, change in tree canopy over the last few years, etc.  Their semester project will be written up into an extension education type report.
",N/A,--,True,"• UF’s Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) regularly works with students in diverse courses who request data about parking spaces, parking decal sales, and citations. Professional staff from TAPS provide and discuss the data with students, who use the information in class projects. As a result of working with TAPS, students develop an understanding of the complex logistical considerations (environmental impact, economic cost, impact on the local community and infrastructure, etc.) that govern transportation decision-making on a campus the size of a small city.

• Two undergraduate students are working with the Office of Sustainability to design, operate, and improve a bike share program for university departments. UF has a large campus and fully-utilized parking; for these reasons, faculty and staff often find traveling across campus to meetings or research facilities a challenge. Parking nearby is often not available and distances are too great to comfortably cover on foot. The undergraduate students who work on this program repurpose bicycles that have been abandoned on campus – making necessary repairs and distributing the bikes to academic and operational departments that request them. The students are in regular contact with participating departments to study how and how often the bikes are utilized, to identify barriers to use, and to determine program modifications that would improve the effectiveness of the program and divert on-campus personal-vehicle transportation to more sustainable alternatives (e.g. bicycle travel).

• A student studying transportation engineering recently completed a project with a faculty member in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering Transportation Program to study pedestrian crosswalks on campus to determine the factors that influence driver yielding and pedestrian crossing.  The result of the project was a set of models that could be used for sustainable transportation design and analysis.
",True,"• During the 2013 and 2014 football seasons, the Office of Sustainability and numerous undergraduate interns and student volunteers worked toward a zero-waste football season. The highest single-game waste diversion rate during these two seasons was nearly 70%. Student interns and volunteers are active drivers of this program – interacting with fans and vendors to continuously adapt and improve both the logistics of this program as well the education and communications campaign that accompanies the operational components. Based on student observations and suggestions, the final game of the season was used to pilot a new strategy of posting one waste “ambassador” at each pair of composting and recycling bins to communicate directly with fans about how to sort their waste. The results of this pilot program will be used to inform operational strategies during the 2015 season.
 
• UF’s Physical Plant Division has worked and continues to work closely with students and researchers throughout the University of Florida on the composting of organics and compostable containers and cutlery from UF facilities, the generation of energy from organics at UF (e.g. via methane digesters, biofuels, etc.), audits of the campus-wide and facilities-specific waste streams, more sustainable landfill management techniques and technologies, and composting education and outreach. 
",True,"• Students in the multidisciplinary course Landscape Architecture Design Implementation (LAA 4450) design and complete a full set of construction documents for a project that integrates the principles of construction with design on UF’s campus. Students from this course won back-to-back national championships in 2012 and 2013 for the EPA Campus RainWorks Challenge for designs of green infrastructure on the UF campus – a feat that no other university has achieved. The RainWorks competition was created by EPA to inspire the next generation of landscape architects, planners, and engineers to develop innovative green infrastructure systems that mitigate the impacts of urban stormwater while supporting vibrant and sustainable communities. The UF students’ work is featured on the EPA websites: http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/crw_winners.cfm#Florida and http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/crw_2013winners.cfm 

This course also prepared designs for UF’s 2009 entry into the Solar Decathalon. That structure, which incorporated water and energy conservation as key features, has since been erected in the UF Energy Research Park.

• Of the 5500 sqft in the administration and lab building associated with UF’s on-campus wastewater treatment plant, 1650 sqft are dedicated to academic research. Additionally, the Physical Plant Division conducts numerous tours of the facility for UF courses, enabling students to learn how the topics discussed in class are directly applied to campus operations.
",True,"• Students and faculty are voting members on the Campus Master Plan Steering Committee, the Sustainability Committee, the Lakes Vegetation and Land Use Committee, the Transportation Committee, and the Diversity Committee, among others. Through their involvement on these committees, UF students and faculty help guide the university’s planning process and governance toward a future that advances sustainability initiatives and that meets the diverse needs of different campus communities (e.g. students, faculty, operational staff, administration, and community partners).

In recent large initiatives, students and faculty at UF have had direct and critical involvement in the 2015 update to the Campus Master Plan as well as the Reitz Union Lawn study through their involvement on the aforementioned committees and through public comment. Additional details about the campus master plan and Reitz Union Lawn study follow.

Campus Master Plan:
Every 5 years the University of Florida must prepare and publish an update of its Campus Master Plan. The Master Plan is a document that guides future growth in a sustainable fashion on campus, by evaluating sites, protecting significant resources and guiding the development process. In order to gain feedback from Faculty, Staff and Students, the University appoints a representative group form each of these constituencies to review plan documents and offer suggestions that help make the document(s) and planning process more inclusive. For the 2015-2025 Master Plan, two student representatives were appointed and expressed concerns on issues important to students over a one year process.

Reitz Union Lawn Study:
The Reitz Union Lawn is a remnant of green space that has been preserved since the University’s inception. Originally, the green space concept was much larger/longer in size, running through the middle of campus. However, over the years portions of the green space were developed, fragmenting the original space into distinct areas, such as the Reitz Union Lawn.  In November 2012, the University undertook a yearlong planning exercise to create a guide for how redevelopment of landscape features should proceed in a congruous fashion for the Lawn and to help define the boundaries of the space for future preservation. The planning process involved the hiring of a Landscape Architectural firm to analyze the space, involve stakeholder and make recommendations. The landscape team in association with stakeholders from faculty, staff and students held charrettes to identify important features and issues in the current design and to review the suggested results. Student groups included members of Student Government, cyclist, and student users of the Reitz Union who were interested in making the space safer and more functional from their perspective. The master plan effort proceeded to analyze and develop alternative long range strategies for future development of the open space study area with the goal of partially implementing the results of the study as part of the current Reitz Union expansion.
",--,N/A,True,"• The Care One Clinic is a UF-affiliated outreach organization that seeks to meet the unique needs of patients who are frequent visitors to the UF Shands ER. Care One accomplishes this by collaborating with a team of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and psychologists to determine whether patients need additional testing or referrals to primary or specialty care. The director of Care One has IRB approval for studying the positive impact Care One is making on reducing ER visits, admissions, and hospital costs for uninsured and insured patients. She has presented posters on the clinic and receives continuing grant funding to cover clinic costs. ",--,N/A,True,"•	During the spring 2014 semester, senior Public Relations students from UF’s College of Journalism and Communications developed the Beat Waste (#beatwaste) campaign to increase campus-wide awareness and participation in UF’s zero waste football stadium initiative. Through Karma PR, a student-run PR agency at the University of Florida, the students conducted qualitative and quantitative research to determine the most effective methods of communicating about and garnering active participation in UF’s efforts to minimize waste production during football games. Currently, almost all products sold in the stadium are either recyclable or compostable; however, this is not common knowledge among fans. The main challenge is therefore educating fans about the university’s stadium waste program and motivating them to participate by properly sorting their waste into the appropriate containers/bins.

After analyzing their research results, the students at Karma PR decided to creatively target Gator fans’ sense of pride and competitive school spirit to drive participation in this sustainability program. Due primarily to time constraints, the Beat Waste campaign was not formally implemented for the 2014 football season. However, the students’ research and recommendations have already and will continue to inform the Office of Sustainability’s communications about and logistical improvements to the football stadium zero waste program.

The data was continually disseminated via blog posts and website developed by the student team: http://uhcarbonfootprint.wix.com/uhcfp.
 
The final inventory data was incorporated in the current UH STARS report for the air and climate section and included on the UH sustainability website.
The team worked with senators in the Administration and Finance Senate Committee to draft a university bill that requested the university be accountable for an annual inventory and mitigating its greenhouse gases. Simultaneously, members of the group worked closely with the stakeholders that would be affected by this policy change to ensure that the future gathering of data would go smoothly.

The final draft of the university bill was presented to the Senate Floor at a Student Governance Association meeting held on April 23, 2014. Once it was introduced, the senate passed the measure unanimously. The bill has now been signed by the student body president and will soon be considered and potentially approved by the University of Houston president.

Students in Professor John Gilderbloom's spring 2010 course UPA 680-01 URBAN RESEARCH SEMINAR were involved in designing and pre-testing the initial survey instrument administered by Institutional Research. Questions explored not only commuting habits by demographics, but willingness to consider alternative modes and barriers to their use. Graduate students took the lead in analyzing the resulting data which was used to set a baseline for the Sustainability Council's effort to document greenhouse gas emissions and to develop a plan to reduce vehicle miles traveled to campus. In fall 2012, the Sustainability Council launched a full suite of transportation alternatives (free bikeshare, Earn-A-Bike, carpool matching, and carshare in addition to free transit). The impact of these new programs was assessed by a follow-up survey conducted in spring 2013. This survey was also a collaboration between staff in university administration and Urban & Public Affairs professor Frank Goetzke (serving as Principle Investigator) and graduate research assistants who again helped revise and pre-test the survey instrument and analyze the data. A third follow-up survey in the longitudinal study was conducted in fall 2015, with Urban & Public Affairs professor Dave Simpson serving as Principle Investigator and graduate research assistants again involved in revising and pre-test the survey instrument and analyzing the data. The longitudinal study has been pivotal to informing the Sustainability Council's on-going work to provide a full suite of transportation alternatives that meet the needs of our evolving campus population. We have been successful in reducing vehicle miles traveled and shifting the mode share in both the student and employee populations.

Since July 2010, volunteers have been collecting food wastes for on-campus composting from some UofL Dining Service outlets, area coffee shops, residence halls, and other community sources, but this was the first time that the operation was used as a living lab for a class research project. Students were divided into small groups, each of which designed different experiments associated with various stages of the composting process from leaf litter piles to primary food waste composting bins to vermiculture bins to finished compost used as organic fertilizer in the campus’ Garden Commons raised beds.",True,"RAINWATER MANAGEMENT: When UofL launched an extensive initiative in partnership with Louisville’s Metropolitan Sewer District to install new storm water management systems in 2011, it did so with an important campus as a living lab component. Student, faculty, and staff researchers from UofL's Center for Infrastructure Research installed monitoring equipment to study infiltration rates, storage capacity, and the performance of various infiltration basin designs on Belknap campus. Many traditional-looking parking lots, plazas and lawns across campus now conceal advanced storm water infiltration systems. Instead of draining to the combined sewer system, these areas drain to large underground infiltration basins capable of handling huge rainfall events and the water from surrounding rooftops. These designs were included in the following projects (with the square footage of impervious surface area mitigated in parentheses):
1.	Ekstrom Library western lawn - completed in fall 2012, this infiltration system captures roof run-off from surrounding buildings (108,000 sf)
2.	The UTA/Ville Grill plaza renovated in 2011. (14,550 sf)
3.	The Red Barn plaza renovated in 2011. (4,120 sf)
4.	The Grawemeyer Oval lawn renovated in 2011. (76,368 sf)
5.	The College of Business parking lot renovated in 2011. (86,052 sf)
6.	The parking lot behind Bettie Johnson Hall, the Urban Studies Institute, and University Planning, Design & Construction renovated in 2011. (67,629 sf)
7.	The Speed Museum expansion project has been designed with a large infiltration basin beneath the plaza which will be able to handle roof drainage from Strickler Hall, Life Sciences, and the College of Business. (94,304 sf)
8.	The new Student Recreation Center opened in October 2013 with an infiltration system that is larger than originally planned. It has a connected load that captures rainwater from most of the land surrounding Billy Minardi Hall as well.

ANNE BRADEN INSTITUTE: UofL's Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research was founded in 2006 to honor the work and legacy of longtime racial justice organizer, educator and journalist Anne Braden. The Institute seeks to advance public understanding of the U.S. civil rights movement, both its powerful history and its unfinished agenda of racial and social justice. Our vision is that scholarship and activism inform and strengthen each other and sustain social justice locally, regionally, nationally and globally. Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic research and community activism for racial and social justice. To do so, we stimulate and support initiatives and programs that cultivate dialogue and cooperation between scholarship and activism. We focus on the modern African American freedom movement, other modern peace and social justice movements, and the intersections among racial, economic, gender, and wider social justice. Because the Institute’s work grows out of U.S. history, with its legacy of white supremacy, we see race/racism as central elements in all aspects of social justice in the United States. Our work aims at uncovering those connections and at the successful bridging of racial divides, with a special focus on the Louisville community and the U.S. South.

Acting as consultants, they are able to work with office managers to develop strategies and improve best practices for reducing both the amount of paper purchased and the amount that gets thrown away as well as develop and provide a green purchasing guide made up of products that are available to purchase through the campus vendors such as Office Max.

One effective way that they are able to do that is by communicating and working directly with our paper company's campus representative from Office Max. They are able to provide raw purchasing data over a period of months, which the students are then able to analyze and synthesize into useful charts and figures. They can then be used to educate offices on the financial and environmental merits of something as simple as reducing the amount of paper an office purchases on a monthly basis. ",True,True,"At UMass Amherst we have a Bike Share Program that was started by a student in 2010. This program allows students to rent bikes for 24 hours for free in the Fall and Spring. Student use these bikes to commute around campus instead of driving. In the Spring of 2013 a student in our Sustainability Fellowship Program helped to coordinate the Bike Share Program. This student researched other schools' bicycle sharing programs to learn about different ways to make our program more efficient. One example of this was the idea of using a computer to keep track of information so that it would be easier to keep track of the bikes. This student wrote up a report about everything he learned, he received a grade and credit.  Students serve on the Bike Share committee and the Bicycle Advisory Committee (BAC).

UMass Amherst students are eligible to participate in the NuRide Program. This program offers incentives to anyone who takes the bus, rides their bike or carpools.

University of Missouri’s Campus Facilities - Energy Management department has a long history of collaborating with students, faculty, and campus researchers to support both education and research efforts in the areas of energy production, energy conservation, and the use of renewable energy technologies.  A sampling of activities at MU over the last few years include:

Energy Facility Tours – Energy Management tours 800 to 1,000 students annually through the campus energy facilities.  The facility tours are customized per the request of the instructor or campus organization to enhance the topic they’re learning or have interest.  Tour requests have increased recently for those wanting to see and learn more about the biomass energy system in the plant.

Class Room Guest Lectures – Department energy professionals are routinely invited into the class room to provide presentations on various energy topics.  Most presentations in the past few years have been topics related to biomass energy, wind/solar energy, and energy conservation.

Senior Class Capstone Projects – They support senior level design projects referred to as Capstone Projects when requested.  Most recently they helped a Capstone Project Design group by providing them information resources which helped them complete a schematic design of a bio-digester combined with a micro combustion turbine using food waste as the fuel source.  

Energy Related Internships – Two years ago they hired a PhD candidate in Bio-Engineering as part of an internship program to support his research thesis to demonstrate that a dynamic computational model could be used to accurately model and analyze a biomass supply chain.   The student effectively modeled the biomass supply chain for the Campus’s new biomass boiler as part of his research. 

Student Employment – The Energy Management department employs MU students on a part time basis to supplement the projects and activities of the department.  Typically 6 to 10 students, mostly engineering undergraduates, work in the department part time.  This gives these students “real world” experience in the energy industry to prepare them for their future careers.

Energy Related Research Support – Energy Management engineers get engaged in energy related research activities; many of the campus researchers seek input from the department engineers on the viability and applicability of their research to the energy industry.  Most of the recent focus has been with the campus Forestry Department with researchers who are researching sourcing of various biomass feed stocks and their applicability as fuel in the energy industry.

On Campus Renewable Energy Projects – In the past couple years, Energy Management significantly increased the campus’s renewable energy portfolio which included the installation of three on-campus projects providing students, faculty, and staff resources to learn about and experience renewable energy technologies.  The projects are accessible to classes and campus organizations through scheduled facility tours, as well as access to the energy production data via a web based dashboard.  The projects include:

""The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of changes to the built environment to determine whether street crossing infrastructure modifications change pedestrian crossing behaviors or traffic patterns in a low-income and predominately racial/ethnic minority community."" from Sonja Wilhem Stanis', professor in Parks, Recreation and Tourism, research abstract.  

Methods:

Data collection occurred at one Intervention site (Providence Road) and one Control site (College Avenue) in Columbia, MO. We selected the Control site by examining relevant characteristics of the neighborhood (e.g., size, income level), and the corresponding street (e.g., number of lanes, typical traffic volumes/speeds, pedestrian crossing facilities). Street crossing behaviors were collected using direct observation and assessed the mode of transportation, legality of the crossing (e.g., at intersections/crosswalks or not), as well as race/ethnicity, gender, and age within 5-6 zones at both sites. Magnetic traffic detectors were also embedded in both the Intervention and Control streets during the data collection to capture traffic volume and speed. Data collection ran concurrently at both sites for seven days (Monday-Sunday) over the same two-week period in June 2012 (pre-intervention) and June 2013 (post-intervention), crossing behaviors were recorded for three hours each day (7:30am, 12:30pm, and 3:30pm) while traffic data were collected continuously for 168 hours during the first week. 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Independent samples t-tests assessed overall changes in pedestrian crossings and traffic volume at each site from 2012 to 2013. Changes in legal/illegal crossings and traffic speed (above the speed limit/below the speed limit) at each site from 2012 to 2013 were analyzed using Pearson’s Chi Square.

Conclusions 
The replacement of an unsafe pedestrian bridge with an at-grade, signalized pedestrian crosswalk and landscaped median significantly impacted both pedestrian crossing behaviors and vehicular traffic behaviors. Specifically, the installation of the pedestrian crosswalk yielded reduced proportions of illegal crossings (especially among children), and reduced the percentage of vehicles speeding on the highway through the neighborhood at the Intervention site while the percentage of vehicles speeding at the Control site increased. This study suggests that street crossing infrastructure changes do change behavior, which will help inform future street crossing interventions and may be used to guide policies promoting physical activity in similar communities where high-speed arterials are barriers to parks and active living.

Implications for Practice and Policy 
By demonstrating increased pedestrian safety and traffic calming, this study adds support to the feasibility of advocacy efforts to reverse transportation practices that favor automobiles at the expense of pedestrian accessibility. These successful outcomes could be used to support advocacy efforts seeking to modify the built environment to increase physical activity in underserved neighborhoods.""

""Purpose. To examine the efficacy of a novel intervention for problematic eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction. Design. Participants enrolled in the intervention or waitlist comparison group were assessed at pre and post 10 weeks. Setting. Midwestern university. Subjects. One hundred twenty-four female employees or partners/spouses. Intervention. Eat for Life is a 10-week group intervention integrating mindfulness and intuitive eating skills. Measures. Self-report questionnaires included the Intuitive Eating Scale, Body Appreciation Scale, Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Questionnaire for Eating Disorder Diagnoses, and an author-constructed supplemental and demographic questionnaire. Analysis. Analyses of covariance and ordinal regression measured group differences. Structural equation modeling examined mediation effects. Results. Significant differences between groups were observed for body appreciation (F1,121 = 40.17, p= .000, partial eta squared= .25), intuitive eating (F1,121 = 67.44, p = .000, partial eta squared= .36), and mindfulness (F1,121 = 30.50, p = .000, partial eta squared= .20), with mean scores significantly higher in the intervention group than waitlist comparison group after 10 weeks. The intervention group was 3.65 times more likely to be asymptomatic for disordered eating than the comparison group. Mindfulness served as a partial mediator. Conclusion. The study provides support for an intervention combining intuitive eating and mindfulness for treatment of problematic eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction, with limitations including self-selection and lack of active control group.

E-WASTE RECYCLING  

The use of electronic products has grown substantially in recent years, changing the ways in which we communicate, access information and entertain ourselves. Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a term for electronic products that have become unwanted, non-working or obsolete, and have essentially reached the end of their useful life. Obsolete electronic devices are rapidly filling the landfills of the globe. In the US alone, more than 100 million computers are thrown away with less than 20% being recycled properly. The EPA estimates as much as 60 million metric tons enter landfills every year. Most electronics that are improperly thrown away contain some form of harmful materials such as beryllium, cadmium, mercury 
and lead. These materials might be trace elements, but when added up in volume, the threat to the environment is significant. Besides adding harmful elements to the environment, improper disposal of e-waste is a recycling opportunity lost.

",True,"The University is also committed to using its campus as a living laboratory for Buildings and given that ""Thomas Jefferson designed the Lawn as a teaching tool, specifying that the columns on the pavilions and Rotunda illustrate the different orders of classical architecture. An example of this commitment and opportunity to emulate this strategy is seen in the design of the Engineering School - Rice Hall, and information technology building. 

With the assistance of Trane, a leading manufacturer of commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC), and the geotechnical, environmental and civil engineering firm of H.C. Yu & Associates, the School transformed the building into a Living Laboratory. It instrumented Rice Hall with 17,000 sensors to monitor the building’s heating, cooling, lighting and energy recovery systems. In essence, these sensors transformed the building into a test bed for sustainable use, setting the stage for faculty and students to work with Trane engineers to develop new energy efficient HVAC strategies and products. “There are few buildings like this in the country,” says Larry Cummings, Trane’s market leader for strategic partnerships.
A special feature of the Living Laboratory is its six pairs of offices and laboratories, all sharing a similar size, orientation and use pattern, but each outfitted with different heating and cooling technologies. “In most cases, this kind of comparative analysis — especially at the room level — is conducted in carefully controlled test facilities,” says Ronald Williams, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. “Students will be able to see how these systems perform in real spaces occupied by real people on a daily basis.”  

Trane views its participation as a strategic investment. “Certainly, we’re helping the Engineering School meet its facilities needs and serve its mission,” Cummings says. “At the same time, Trane will be learning things that will help us develop new products and differentiate ourselves in a very competitive marketplace.” The functionality and design of the building has contributed greatly to the studying environment and aided in the collaborative nature of the space.

",True,"Moreover, the University strives to use its campus as a living laboratory for Dining Services/Food. To do so, The Green Dining Working Group, under the Environmental Stewardship Subcommittee is comprised of students, faculty, and staff was established to facilitate work in on-grounds projects.  During the 2013-2014 academic year, Green Dining initiatives demonstrated significant progress in the furtherance of sustainable dining practices at the University. Waste diversion was a pronounced component within the portfolio of anticipated goals. Composting of food waste on Grounds was expanded to include a total of 20 locations managed by U.Va. Dining. As a result, the organic diversion rate in 2013 increased approximately 50%. Over 148 tons (US) of organic waste material was repurposed as compost in 2013. Additionally, unique events such as Game Day Challenge and Recyclemania not only helped increase overall diversion rates, but also simultaneously raised awareness and encouraged student participation. In an attempt to proactively limit waste, reusable ware programs were encouraged through the promotion of reusable to-go boxes as well as distribution of reusable mugs. Sustainable packaging is ingrained in the purchasing protocol for a significant portion of U.Va. Dining’s program, which increases diversion capabilities. Green Dining continuously strives to increase its sustainably sourced menu options. The undertaking includes, but is not limited to, offering Meat-Free Monday meals, providing a designated residential vegan station, increasing the purchasing capacity of certified Fair Trade products, procuring local and/or organically grown food items, and sourcing sustainably harvested seafood. Green Dining outreach efforts were incorporated into U.Va. Sustainability programming for World Water Day, Campus Sustainability Day and Earth Day. In addition, a significant amount of outreach was directed at promoting unique Sustainable Food events again, intended to promote awareness of U.Va. Dining’s sustainability efforts. 

This commitment has garnered positive feedback and has helped the University promote sustainability to various students, faculty and staff. The positive outcomes associated with this work can be seen in students' awareness and appreciation in recycling, composting, and desire to learn and be more sustainable on Grounds.

",True,"The University is also committed to using the campus as a living laboratory for Energy. The Energy Working Group, under the Environmental Stewardship Subcommittee, is comprised of students, faculty, and staff, and formed in October 2013. The group's goals focus on three primary areas – changes to the physical infrastructure towards increased energy efficiency, education to inform students about energy conservation issues, and initiatives to change energy consumption behavior.

In 2013, the Group researched peer institutions to gather information regarding setting an overall energy reduction goal. In addition to goal setting and research, the Group participated in the Dorm Energy Race and IDEA’s 3rd and 4th annual campus energy system video contest, placing 2nd and 1st, respectively.
",True,"Furthermore, the University has displayed its promise to using the campus as a living laboratory for Grounds by establishing the Open Space Working Group. This group consists of representatives of both U.Va. (students, faculty, staff) and the U.Va. Foundation spent 2013-2014 collaborating to identify potential projects and initiatives that would be beneficial to both. A partnership was established with the Stormwater Working Group.  In 2014-2015, students are leading an initiative to explore the possibility of outdoor, solar-powered benches/charging stations.

The University's desire to bring and collaborate with numerous personnel and organizations from various disciplines also demonstrates its desire to be a leader in higher education with regards to being conscious of their impact on the environment. These initiatives have helped the institution progress and further challenge it to strive for more awareness and accomplishments through the University.
","The University is also committed to using the campus as a living laboratory for Purchasing. The Green Grounds Group, for example, is dedicated to educating and advocating for sustainable planning, design, implementation and operations on the grounds of the University of Virginia.

Formed in 2004 by planning and architecture students to address green design at the University, the group sponsors projects that encompass a range of sustainable design ideas – from green roofs to energy use to transportation. Through each project, Green Grounds works with a diverse set of university stakeholders including administrators, staff, faculty, students and community members.

Holding a strong conviction that the University of Virginia can and should employ sustainable practices as part of their growth strategy, the Green Grounds Group promotes a broad range of projects from minimization of energy consumption to selection of low environmental impact materials to site and building water management to improved indoor air quality.

Although this organization has members who are University of Virginia students and may have University employees associated or engaged in its activities and affairs, the organization is not a part of or an agency of the University.

",True,True,"The University's commitment to using the campus as a living laboratory for Transportation is demonstrated through the Transportation Working Group, under the Environmental Stewardship Subcommittee. The group is comprised of students, faculty, and staff.  This year, with the impending graduation of the group’s student lead, Alex, and an EIS-wide directive towards long-term plans, the Transportation Working Group focused on projects with long-term implications compared to the high-impact, short-term projects completed in previous years. At the very core of this mission, one of the group’s GIFT projects, Redefining Transportation, assembled a total of 30 students, staff, faculty, and local residents to evaluate mobility around U.Va. during a 2 hour workshop entitled Sustained Mobility. While the Carbon Reduction Plan and Nitrogen Reduction Plan affect vehicle transportation, the working group realized that mobility (both motorized and non-motorized) better addressed the root problem: multiple alternative trip modes from source to destination.

While Sustained Mobility did not consider ADA mobility needs, it did consider bus routes, bicycle infrastructure, pedestrian access, flooding, and nighttime safety in detail by splitting participants into predefined University quadrants and facilitating discussion. Following the event, Kimley Horn compiled the maps and notes written from the event to draft a summary that was then prioritized by the working group to create a Master Plan for the University. Outside of this project, the working group led a special committee to select the vendor, Social Bicycles, for the Bike Share program debuting in the fall; distributed free front and rear bike lights while hosting a bike safety quiz, U.Va. Police bike registration, and a bike safety pledge; and held monthly maintenance workshops at the fix it stations placed by the group in prior years. 

Moreover, there was great feedback by numerous students in not only having alternative forms of transportation but ones that addressed issues surrounding sustainability. Additionally, this has started dialogue on ways the University can better serve its students, faculty and staff in was that are sustainable.
",True,"The University is also committed to using the campus as a living laboratory for Waste. The Materials Working group is comprised of students, faculty, and staff, is under the Environmental Stewardship Subcommittee and also includes several task forces dedicated to specific projects on Grounds. A primary concern of the group participants is the lack of co-location of trash and recycling bins inside buildings. Libraries are of particular concern, as often there is a trash can located at each desk or table, while recycling bins are only located near the doors. The working group decided to conduct an audit of Alderman Library, a location known for having trash cans at every desk in the stacks, and develop recommendations to decrease trash cans, improve co-location, and increase recycling. The group partnered with Green Grounds for the audit, as Green Grounds is working to improve recycling in the Clark Hall coffee shop. When finished, the group will present recommendations to UVa Libraries, Housekeeping, and UVa Recycling.

The Styrofoam Working Group finalized draft language for the Expanded Polystyrene Policy, which was presented to the EIS for review at the January meeting. The policy bans the single use of food service products made of expanded polystyrene (commonly known as Styrofoam) on the academic side of Grounds. The policy currently does not include the Health System, but the Materials Working Group will continue to work with the Health System to eventually apply the policy in those areas. The Policy has been submitted to the University Policy Committee through their review process.

The positive outcomes associated with this commitment are the sharing of best practices, collaboration on ideas and methodologies. Moreover, these organizations have been recognized by various students, faculty and staff and aligned with the University's commitment to integrating a sustainable initiative in its mission.  

EIS Waste Recycling and Composing: Graphics and Standards Task Force - Continuing on the success of the installation of three BigBelly’s last year, the Task Force continued to focus on the possibility of expanding the BigBelly Program on Grounds. BigBelly units have a solar compacting trash can collocated with a recycling bin in a side by side unit. A waste audit conducted in the fall showed that BigBelly units received less contamination in their recycling and trash bins than traditional units and reduced the number of trash pick-ups required. As a result, the Task Force submitted a GIF Proposal to fund the expansion of the BigBelly program to add up to 20 additional bins at high volume locations.

The Zero Waste Initiative continued to gain momentum this year, as the UVa Office for Sustainability joined forces with zero waste to perform a large-scale pilot at the U.Va. vs. Notre Dame basketball game. The event was similar in concept to the Zero Waste Athletics pilot in 2013 but larger in scale. The combined efforts helped make the event a success, collecting 1,300 lbs of compost, 1,600 lbs of recycling, and 800 lbs of cardboard. In addition, Matt and Ashley, along with their successors Blake and Ford, continued to work with John Paul Jones Arena staff to evaluate options for making back-of-house composting a permanent part of operations at the Arena. 
",True,"Furthermore, the University has dedicated to using the campus as a living laboratory for Water through the Environmental Stewardship Subcommittee's Storm Water Task Force (SWTF). This task force has an ultimate goal of improving local streams by reducing the volume of storm water that leaves Grounds and improving the quality of the water that does. A philosophy adopted by the SWTF is that a reduction in quantity of storm water runoff is a foremost priority, which will in turn reduce downstream erosion and transport of sediment, nutrients, and pollutants.

Last year, the SWTF worked to identify opportunities and establish relationships for doing so. To encourage and promote student involvement, SWTF also focused on student outreach and education this year. The students created many materials for future outreach initiatives, and an online presence as an avenue for outreach.

Additionally, the Water Working Group elected to pursue a series of both finite and broader policy-level projects. Bottle Fill Station Retrofits, a ‘I Heart Tap’ Poster Campaign, and Dorm Water Challenge are projects that target individual user education and action. These projects address cost savings for users; more responsible use of global water resources; reduction in petroleum, energy and carbon dioxide emissions (from the manufacture, shipping and recycling of single use plastic water bottles); reduction of plastic waste in oceans; and reduction of the University’s potable water use and waste/recycling stream.

http://www.questbridge.org/about-questbridge/mission-a-vision",True,"Additionally, the University is committed to using the campus as a living laboratory for Health, Wellbeing and Work through, for example, the Stall Seat Journal. The Stall Seat Journal (SSJ) is a poster created by professionals and students from the Office of Health Promotion. It uses a social norms approach with data from U.Va. students to showcase the healthy choices they’re making.  It also educates about safe, responsible choices around a variety of health issues.  The SSJ hangs in the bathroom stalls of first-year dorms, Newcomb, and Elson Student Health Center.

People tend to overestimate certain unhealthy behaviors. One reason is that many of these behaviors are visible and they draw our attention, like people smoking or a person passed out at a party. One survey showed 68% of U.Va. students overestimated the number of drinks per week that most U.Va. students consume.

Likewise, people tend to underestimate certain healthy behaviors because they are largely invisible or “part of the pattern.”  Studying, prayer and using a condom are all examples of this. 32% of U.Va. students didn’t realize that most U.Va. students, while drinking alcohol, make their own drinks or watch their drinks being made.

Overestimating unhealthy behaviors and underestimating healthy behaviors can create internal pressure to behave a certain way. By correcting misperceptions like these and focusing on the accurate ‘norm,’ students have space to act on their own values.""

Through the SSJ and other programs such as the Peer Health Educators, the University has engaged in educating its students on the importance of understanding Health and Wellbeing. Moreover, these initiatives have helped students engage in ways that the University can better serve its students and other faculty/staff.

",True,"Lastly, the University is also committed to using the campus as a living laboratory in other areas besides the ones mentioned above.  In September 2013, U.Va. became the first university in the nation to set a reactive nitrogen goal when the Board of Visitors amended the approved Sustainability Commitment to include a goal to reduce the amount of reactive nitrogen lost to the environment to levels 25% below year 2009 amounts by the year 2025. This research, which created the first nitrogen footprint for a university, is a student led project, first developed as a 2009 undergraduate thesis by Allison Leach. The ongoing project is led by Allison Leach and Professor Jim Galloway in the Department of Environmental Sciences.

The integrated nitrogen footprint project aims to develop a replicable model to help universities calculate and reduce their nitrogen footprint. The research team has designed this replicable model, has calculated the nitrogen footprint of U.Va., has helped establish the University’s goal, and is in the process of extending this replicable model to other universities. U.Va.’s progress towards meeting the nitrogen goal will be tracked by the Office for Sustainability through collaboration with others across the University to obtain data. Full updates to the model will occur every four years.

A Nitrogen Working Group, under the Environmental Stewardship Subcommittee, formed in early 2015.  In this group, students, faculty, and staff will collaborate to implement nitrogen-reducing projects on grounds.
