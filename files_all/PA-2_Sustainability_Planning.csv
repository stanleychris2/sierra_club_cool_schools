*Entrepreneurial learners is based on the concept proposed by John Seely Brown that entrepreneurial
learning is the point at which thinking (about ideas and interests) meets making (context and things);
it is a vision that promotes students finding their expressive voice, exploring new ways to learn, new ways
to serve, and for them to embrace learning as a continuous, life-long experience beyond the classroom.
Practitioners and educational policy-makers must become entrepreneurs as well by scaling up the
innovative ideas and practices; thinking about different ways of doing business, that optimally enable
students’ learning in the 21st Century. If the typical 20th Century learning institution was a steamship
plodding along at consistent speed on a set course, the 21st Century institution should be a white water
raft moving quickly with the ability to traverse whatever direction or waves the environment dictates.

18 Primary Goals, 29 Metrics are included in the Supporting Strategies. Therefore, all current 107 metrics

Preface
SOS II: Strategic Directions for Sustainability at Berea College1
The comprehensive state of our world’s environment – including climate change, population growth, decrease in biotic diversity, and overuse of the world’s natural resources – is worsening. These trends have been extensively researched scientifically and are indisputable. In 2005 the United Nations’ report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment project, entitled Ecosystems and Human Well-being (2005), provided a five-year assessment of 24 basic natural systems worldwide (i.e., air-quality, fresh-water-availability, health of fish populations, ozone- depletion, etc.). That report concludes that 15 of the world’s 24 natural systems are in decline or are unsustainable. Further, the report identifies the impact of carbon emissions and fossil fuels on our atmosphere as the single most pressing issue. This is due to (a) the long-term consequences of the damage; (b) the extensive time required to enact effective solutions and responses (e.g. moving from coal to clean fuels); and (c) the additional extensive time for the affected natural systems (e.g. air, oceans, etc.) to recover.
The scientific community’s deep concerns related to global environment and especially climate change (e.g. air, oceans, etc.) have now permeated the mainstream media. For example, Thomas Friedman’s book, Hot, Flat and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution – And How It Can Renew America (2008), summarizes the pressing global-environmental issues that include climate change, population growth, decrease of biotic diversity, and overuse of the world’s natural resources. Friedman also focuses on the strong evidence for climate change and the human contribution to carbon emissions. Since the rise of the industrial revolution, CO2 levels have risen about 100 parts per million (from 280 to 387 PPM) and have been the main cause of a warming of the earth’s average surface temperatures that already has begun to have deleterious effects (e.g., melting of glaciers and permafrost at alarming rates).
The SPC concurs with these findings when it urges Berea College to reduce not only carbon emissions but also to decrease use and increase recycling of all natural resources. The report from SOS II concludes that sustainability does not begin and end with climate change but includes the unsustainable use of all natural resources (see pp. 3-5). Friedman agrees when he says that those of us in the United States with slightly less than 5% of the world’s population use approximately 20% of the fossil fuels and natural resources (raw and manufactured) in the whole world and that this fact constitutes the clearest sign of the unsustainability of our current way of life. He continues to say that if all six billion people in this world achieved only a modest middleclass American way of life, it would take three earths to provide the necessary natural resources for support. He concludes, “We cannot afford any more Americas.”
1 This proposal from the SPC is an attempt to build upon the proposal made by the Subcommittee on Sustainability II (2007-08), co-chaired by Rebecca Bates and Steve Pulsford with Elaine Adams, Randy Adams, Ashley Cochrane, Tracy Hodge, Alice Hooker, Micah Johnson, Mario Nakazawa, Mike Panciera, Danielle Spencer and Ben Boggs (ex officio) as members. Even though this document is the work of three Strategic Planning Councils, it gives reference to the SOS II Report in a number of places and quotes liberally from that document.
On September 23, 2008, the Subcommittee on Sustainability II (SOS II) report urged Berea College to make the issues of CO2 emissions and climate change central concerns for itself and the way our community thinks about sustainability for ourselves and others (see pp. 2-3). SOS II suggested that the College adopt the following goal: “Reduce Berea College’s consumption of non-renewable resources and ensure that Berea moves continuously toward the goal of carbon-neutrality by creating a Sustainability Committee that would design and oversee a Natural Resource Strategy” (p. 12).
Sustainability for an educational institution like Berea College does not only entail studying and assessing ecological matters, but also requires creating an educational community that teaches and acts in sustainable ways. In this vein, the report from SOS II also recommended that the College “increase efforts to create a culture of sustainable behavior by educating our community about the global and regional ecological crisis and methods for reducing our impact.” This focus on creating a culture of sustainability speaks to the core of Berea as an educational community. We must consider ourselves teachers and learners of sustainability in all dimensions of campus life and practice.
The report from the first SOS (December, 1998) placed sustainability within the context of the College’s Christian principles of social justice and a commitment to “plain living”: “Sustainability... refers to the capacity of individuals, communities, and societies to coexist in a manner that maintains social justice, environmental integrity, and economic well-being today and for future generations” (p. 3). Building upon this understanding of “sustainability,” the report from SOS II (September, 2008) linked sustainability and the College’s global-ecological responsibility to the College’s mission “as a model community in the 19th century and a sustainable institution in the 21st Century” (see pp. 8-10). Thus, it is our responsibility to reach out beyond our campus community to local, regional, and national communities to join hands in moving towards sustainability broadly understood. It is upon these combined understandings of sustainability as an extension of the College’s traditional values as well as a compelling contemporary necessity, that this proposal situates its vision, principles, and recommendations.
Vision and Principles
In its report, SOS-II characterizes sustainability as a moral imperative. A sustainability commitment is driven by the concern not to live at the expense of others:
To live unsustainably—to consume resources beyond their rate of recovery, to impact ecosystems beyond their capacity to regenerate—is to live in a way that takes resources from others, elsewhere in the world, now and in the future. It is to live at a level of luxury, or with a carelessness, that must be paid for by someone else. (10)
There is a danger that sustainability will be treated as a highly amorphous commitment. Amid competing institutional operations do we take the moral imperative of ecosystems decline so seriously that we are prepared to make very substantial tradeoffs and sacrifices, or do we only move gradually, as is convenient? How do we assess this commitment’s priority over/against our other commitments?
Berea College Sustainability Plan 2
Citing Thoreau’s principle that it is not right to pursue one’s interests “sitting on another man’s shoulders,” and Bill McKibben’s dictum that we should not make ourselves wealthy at the expense of impoverishing the earth (cf. his Bangladesh example), SOS-II argues that Berea College’s commitment to sustainability should be as substantial, as radical, as defining of its residential experience as was John G. Fee’s utopian vision of the nineteenth century: “to live unsustainably is to live irresponsible, indefensibly, and against the historical commitments of Berea College to aid those most in need” (10). But it is difficult to express an intensity of commitment only in words. What degree of commitment is implied by an institutional goal to “seek ways systematically and continuously to reduce consumption of natural resources,” for example?	Effective goals must be quantifiable and measurable.
Neither SOS-II nor SPC were in a position to set numerical goals for Berea College’s future commitment to sustainability. SPC’s recommendations are about process, structures, and direction for setting and meeting such goals; in addition its language is intended to convey urgency and to set a standard of commitment proportionate to the tone of the SOS-II report and to our evolving understanding of the nature and extent of ecosystems crisis.
The report from SOS II asserts that environmental “sustainability is the defining challenge of our time” and that “Berea College challenges itself to live up to its tradition of visionary and principled leadership by becoming a model of sustainability and stewardship of the environment.” To that end, the SPC adopted the Report’s vision of sustainability:
The College’s ultimate goals must be (i) to become truly sustainable, that is to operate without negative physical impact on the lives of others in the world, and (ii) to have positive impacts on the world through education, through creation of a model sustainable community, and through practical engagement with other local sustainability initiatives.
Essentially, Berea College should seek to become sustainable in terms of its institutional policies and practices, to engender a culture of sustainability that penetrates student, faculty, and staff cultures, and to embody a model of collaboration with local, regional, and national sustainability efforts.
The Council agrees with the SOS II call for a cultural change and with the SOS assertion of sustainability within the context of the College’s Christian principles. In fact, the Council’s strategic vision of a sustainable Berea begins with its mission-focused understanding of sustainability as an expression of impartial love as understood in environmental and human terms. The SOS II Report implies several principles that the Council wants to make explicit. In so doing, the Council has identified the following core principles as embedded in the background, vision statement, goals, and recommended action of the SOS II Report as ones it supports:
Berea College Sustainability Plan 3
1.	To incorporate sustainability into all institutional policies, operations, and practices;
2.	To move with deliberate haste toward the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by the College community;
3.	To create an institutional culture of sustainability that alters campus community behavior and sustainability goals with education as a core component in that process; and
4.	To engage in reciprocal and complementary relationships with communities beyond the campus, serving as a model in all policies, operations, practices and behaviors to help educate, inspire, and support the efforts of others in the community.
Core Goals
In an attempt to implement the stated vision and core principles with respect to sustainability, the SPC recommends to the Berea College community five initiatives to minimize energy use, CO2 emissions, and natural resource consumption, all of which will also contribute to significant cost savings. This work is urgent in both practical and moral terms, so progress will need to be measurable and as rapid as possible. Timetables and assessment plans will need to be developed in the early stages of addressing each initiative. While the focus of this proposal is on permanent reduction of energy and other natural resources use, there is a real expectation of economic benefits to Berea College. Given this context, the SPC recommends the following five initiatives:
1.	Systematically and continuously reduce consumption of natural resources directly (e.g., water, raw materials, etc.) and indirectly (e.g., manufactured goods).
This goal aims to reduce Berea College’s “ecological footprint” broadly understood. Specifically, the College should seek to reduce its use of both energy and water, as well as its consumption of non-durable and disposable goods. Re-use and recycling also remain valuable aids toward achieving zero-waste in campus operations. This goal runs parallel to carbon- reduction, because the manufacture of all goods requires energy.
To achieve this aim, the SPC recommends that the College:
a.	Gather baseline-data on consumption of raw materials (e.g., water-use) and manufactured goods (e.g., purchasing, facilities-repairs/renovations, production and disposal of food, etc.);
b.	Develop immediate and long-range plans for reducing consumption of raw materials and manufactured goods;
c.	Seek improvements and implement plans that will reduce the College’s overall ecological footprint; and
d.	Monitor results and revise plans and practices to achieve continuous improvement.
Berea College Sustainability Plan 4
2.	Immediately and continuously reduce Berea College’s consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels and CO2 production.
In recent decades, the College has made significant progress to reduce its consumption of fossil fuels directly (e.g., energy-focused renovations and the new heat-plant) and indirectly (e.g., use of electricity). For example, the heat-plant currently uses approximately half of the natural gas that the old plant used in its last year of service. This goal urges Berea College to move as quickly and fully as possible toward significant and continuous carbon reduction.
To achieve this goal, the College must achieve the following specific objectives, at a minimum:
a.	Gather baseline-carbon-data through an extensive survey of all College activities;
b.	Develop goals, policies, and plans for reduction of fossil fuel use and reduction of carbon-creation through College activities;
c.	Integrate plans with annual and long-term budgetary processes;
d.	Monitor results and alter policies and plans as needed to ensure maximum and continuous progress; and
e.	Develop a plan with timeframe for Berea College to become carbon neutral.2
3.	Create a culture of sustainability through education of Berea’s community regarding global and regional ecological crises and methods for addressing this crisis.
Since the establishment of Being and Becoming in 1996, the second pair of common learning goals has urged the College both “to understand the interconnectedness of our natural, fabricated, and human worlds” and “to understand the workings of our natural environment and the consequences of human interventions”3	The logical extension of those goals is to respond thoughtfully to threats to the natural world and the natural systems that sustain us. The most effective responses will require understanding and action by the whole community. As an educational institution, the College must first learn what it must know about local, regional, and global ecological challenges and then teach and act responsibly. A report from Oberlin College in 1999 states this concept succinctly:
At one level, what has come to be called “greening” the campus is an attempt to operate the complex institutions with greater efficiency and thereby minimize costs. At a second level, [this effort] is an attempt to fulfill a moral commitment to minimize environmental impacts. ...At a higher level...greening of the campus can be seen not as an end but as a means to a larger end: the greening of minds. Its aim is to equip our students with the

analytical skills and practical abilities necessary to do the hard work ahead: stabilize climate, reduce population growth equitably, reverse processes of biotic impoverishment, restore degraded ecosystems, develop sustainable agriculture and forestry, and calibrate political institutions and economies to fit ecological realities. No generation ever faced a more daunting or exciting set of challenges and opportunities.4
To accomplish this aim, Berea College should:5
a.	Charge the College Faculty with the assistance of the Dean of the Faculty and the appropriate committees with leading a process that will within the next two years: (1) develop learning outcomes for sustainability that can be incorporated into the Aims of General Education; (2) identify where emphases on sustainability can be incorporated and added to the curriculum; and (3) develop appropriate workshops and programs for faculty from all disciplines that support curricular changes that promote education about sustainability.
b.	Provide training and professional development for staff so that sustainability becomes an integrated part of the entire College culture. The College should design training to enable staff to produce sustainability assessments: the information in such assessments would become essential elements in reports produced by the standing Committee on Sustainability.
c.	Provide opportunities for and collaborate with students to devise sustainability education and incentives through residence life and student organizations.
d.	Actively and intentionally guide and engage students by providing opportunities for them to be involved in sustainability activities at all levels – curricular, co-curricular, labor, and institutional facilities – not only to enhance their educational experience but to foster ownership and leadership at Berea College and beyond.
e.	Charge People Services to offer educational orientations and programs and to investigate a system of incentives for members of the community to consume less energy at work and at home. Create formal and informal educational programs and opportunities to teach and engender more sustainable lifestyles and practices.
4.	Share sustainable ideas and practices with both the community of Berea itself and the larger community beyond the campus in the process of extending the College’s educational and action initiatives.
The commitments of the College to serve Appalachia and beyond certainly require the broadest possible collaboration of the College with the community. The expectation that the Compton Chair in Ecological Design will provide consultation and assistance in local greening

initiatives serves as one example of such education and outreach. The Energizing Kentucky initiative by the presidents of four Kentucky colleges and universities, including the president of Berea College, represents a second example of such educational outreach and service. This goal aims to combine the knowledge and practices of sustainability on the Berea College campus with those of a wider audience, in order to make a greater impact than the College alone can achieve.
To achieve this goal the College should institute the following practices:
a.	Develop alliances/exchanges with officials of the city, county, and region to effect positive, ecological changes;
b.	Gather, serve as repository for, and disseminate information, and promote best practices about ecology and sustainability (e.g., through conferences, websites, etc.);
c.	Learn from successful initiatives already practiced by members in the local community, and support these efforts to enhance their effectiveness;
d.	Seek alliances with colleges, universities, businesses, and non-profit organizations to extend the core goals stated previously.
5.	Draft a new commitment on sustainability (or revise the current seventh commitment on “plain living”) for the mission of the College, understood in ecological, economic, and human terms.
When the College reviewed its mission in 1993, adding a Preface to the statement, and expanding the Great Commitments, the Committee to Review the Commitments (CRC) commented as follows about the phrase “plain living”:
plain living is the rejection of artificially created wants, the ability to give up luxuries to remove clutter from our lives; conservation of our personal and the earth’s resources; and leading a quality of life characterized by contemplation, spirituality and Christian stewardship.... People electing “plain living” not only derive the individual benefits of a balanced, responsible life, but also produce the collective good of a less burdened environment.
During the development of the College’s Workplace Expectations, the College translated “plain living” into contemporary vernacular as “sustainable living and working.” Given the increasing centrality of the second pair of learning goals in Being and Becoming, the College’s historic commitment to plain living, and the moral urgency of sustainability in local and global terms, we have arrived at the urgent and appropriate moment to embrace sustainability as a more central dimension of the College’s educational mission and operations.
Berea College Sustainability Plan 7
Revisions in Governance
The SOS II Report recommended that the College establish a new position of Vice President for Sustainability to lead and coordinate sustainability initiatives. This recommendation has been adopted through an administrative restructuring and downsizing approved by the Board of Trustees that includes a half-time Chief Sustainability Officer role for the Vice President for Business and Administration (with the new title of Vice President for Operations and Sustainability). This administrative position is designed to possess broad enough scope to lead the College in the tasks imagined by the above stated goals and initiatives and is empowered to work closely with College departments (e.g., facilities management), programs (e.g., SENS) and committees (e.g., AC and the proposed Sustainability Committee). The Chief Sustainability Officer is charged to oversee collection and analysis of sustainability data, to create additional plans to achieve core goals, and to monitor and recommend changes in approach to and direction of the College’s sustainability initiatives. The Chief Sustainability Officer will also serve as an outreach coordinator to work with the community in the creation of a culture of sustainability, and will have the capacity to identify and pursue external funding opportunities. It is expected that the work of the Sustainability Officer position will make substantial impact on carbon reduction and natural resource uses at Berea College while also bringing long-term financial benefits.
The SOS II Report also recommended the formation of a high level Sustainability Committee. To that end:
The SPC recommends that the Executive Council (EC) and Administrative Committee (AC) collaborate to create a new governance/action-group, the Sustainability Committee, which will provide a bridge between the system of shared governance by faculty, staff and students and the administrative system in decision-making for the College – especially the Vice President for Operations and Sustainability.
The SPC recommends that the EC and AC to include the following principles and goals in their creation of a new committee:
a.	Membership would have equal representation of faculty, students, administrators, and staff with a least one from each of these groups having knowledge or expertise in sustainability;
b.	The Vice President for Operations and Sustainability will co-chair with a faculty member;
c.	The Committee will provide oversight across the institution for sustainability: a.	Administrative offices (facilities, operations, etc.) b.	Shared governance (curricula, COGE, etc.)
d. The Committee will assist the Vice President for Operations and Sustainability in setting targets and monitoring progress towards reduced natural resource consumption;
Berea College Sustainability Plan 8
e.	The Committee will provide recommendations to the Faculty and AC to shape future sustainability efforts;
f.	The Committee will provide communication to the community on sustainability issues and initiatives; and
g.	The few remaining duties of the CEPC should be folded into the committee and the CEPC eliminated.
Conclusion
The world’s current rates of greenhouse gas emission and of natural resource consumption have created serious threats to the natural systems that sustain us. The world’s poor have not sufficiently shared in improved standards of living from unsustainable practices, yet they are often among the first to feel the effects of damage to ecosystems. Thus, the issue of sustainability has both practical and moral dimensions. Berea College’s core institutional values call us to make very strong contributions to solving these problems, by recognizing and acting upon sustainability as the defining issue of our time and as an undergirding issue of all aspects of our mission. Only if Berea College’s educational community is sustainable ecologically, economically, and in human terms, will we have a bright future to bequeath to others; only if we are sincerely committed to global sustainability will we have the right to bequeath our institution to others.

APPENDIX A Carbon Neutrality and Berea College
Clean Air - Cool Planet, (CA-CP) is a science-based, non-partisan, 501(c)3 non-profit dedicated solely to finding and promoting solutions to global warming. CA-CP has defined carbon neutrality as follows:
True corporate carbon neutrality means there is no net increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases from the existence of the company.
The process for achieving neutrality should begin with an inventory of the company’s entire carbon footprint and the setting of a clear boundary. The company should then embrace a neutralization strategy that prioritizes the avoidance of emissions, their reduction through energy efficiency, the replacement of high-carbon energy sources with low- or zero-carbon alternatives, and then the use of high-quality carbon offsets.
CA-CP’s Forum for the Future developed the following hierarchy to inform discussions about institutional climate strategy.
What Carbon Neutrality Does Not Mean
Many people who have discussed this issue on campus and beyond misunderstand what “carbon neutrality” means. Here are a few things that carbon neutrality does NOT mean:
• It does not mean an organization’s activities emit no carbon or zero emission—that is impossible. • It does not involve an institution’s investments—it is an accounting of physical carbon emitted or offset. • Neither sustainabilty nor carbon neutrality replaces any part of Berea’s mission—it is a clear expression
of our mission’s plain living commitment in contemporary expression.
The Carbon Management Hierarchy
Actions at the top of the hierarchy are more transformative and lasting in terms of reducing a company’s emissions baseline
1. Avoid -	Avoid carbon-intensive activities 2. Reduce -	Conduct operations more efficiently 3. Replace -	Replace high-carbon energy sources with low-carbon energy ones 4. Offset -	Offset those emissions that can’t be eliminated by green energy or
carbon offsets (usually purchased)
Berea College has been actively seeking to manage its carbon footprint and move toward carbon neutrality for well over a decade. Beginning with intentional definitions of energy and renovation plans in the 1990’s, the College has focused on reducing carbon emissions through energy efficient construction and renovations, retrofits to reduce energy consumption, the replacement of its central heat plant, and educating its students and community to effect behavioral change.
The results of these efforts to date have been striking. The largest part of the College’s carbon footprint, as calculated annually since 2008, is purchased electricity and fuel for heat. The College has calculated the BTU’s used each year since 1998-99 for coal, natural gas and electricity. In 1998-99, the College purchased an equivalent of 266.2 billion BTU’s of energy. In 2009-10, the total was reduced to 140.0 billion BTU’s.
The greenhouse gas emissions inventories for the College have been calculated since 2008. The College’s total emissions have been calculated as follows:

21,096 (6,096)
Source: Berea College GHG Inventory: http://acupcc.aashe.org/
The Strategic Planning Council and the Administrative Committee have excluded Berea’s forest from its operating calculations for two reasons: (1) we wish to keep our forest as a valuable “carbon credit” option to sell in the future, and (2) there are real opportunities to reduce carbon consumption in our operations and we want our Berea community to focus on them.
The planning that will continue the College on a path to carbon neutrality will require attention to each of the aspects of carbon planning – from a careful evaluation of operations and activities, to continued reduction/efficiency strategies, to seeking alternative (lower carbon) energy sources, and finally consideration of offsets (ours or those purchased from others). As recognized by CA-CP, given current technologies, it is impossible for most organizations to be truly carbon neutral without the purchase of offsets. However, the ongoing attention to the measurement and management of the carbon footprint, with the long-term goal of carbon neutrality is a manageable and responsible goal for any organization. For Berea College, the goal of carbon neutrality is an essential element in our commitment through word and example to simple and socially responsible living.
For more information on what Carbon Neutrality means, the following presentation “Getting to Zero: Defining Corporate Carbon Neutrality” is an excellent summary of issues of definition and approaches to move toward carbon neutrality. http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/documents/zero.pdf

Residents are asked to identify which dorm and floor they live on, and are then asked ""How effective has your Eco Rep been at promoting sustainability in your dorm?"", ""To date, what have been the best programs/information offered by your Eco Reps this year?"" (they are given a drop down list to choose from), and ""What would you like to see improved in your dorm in terms of sustainability?"" The survey has consistently provided detailed information about which programming ideas are best engaging the student body.  The survey results are received over the winter break, providing the Outreach Coordinator an opportunity to review material and make changes before the spring semester.  The Outreach Coordinator meets with each EcoRep at the start of the spring semester to review their individual dorm results and make suggestions for improvement and provide goal setting opportunities for the spring semester.

Because of this designation, the college began treating the field organically in 2002. Utilizing an organic program of aeration, compost tea, and hand weeding, over time the college has developed a superb playing field that is completely organic.  Bowdoin has expanded the organic treatment across campus, which now includes 60 percent of the central campus, including the Cleaveland Quad, Main Quad, Coe Quad and the President’s residence and guest house.  The treatments utilize ingredients such as corn gluten, seaweed, bone meal and manure, and pest deterrents such as red pepper and garlic oils.

    Water Conservation: The campus landscapes with native species that do not require irrigation. High visibility grassed areas of campus do receive water during dry weather.  In recent years, as a means of conserving water, the college  installed a below ground irrigation system on athletic fields at Pickard Field and the Main and Cleaveland Quads.  These systems monitor the moisture in the soil and only water accordingly.  The systems are automated to  operate in the early morning hours before the sun rises to reduce evaporation during the watering cycle.   The campus maintains a mowing height of 2.5 to 3 inches, which encourages deeper root growth, thus reducing the need for watering.  Utilizing mulching mowers, grass clippings are left on the lawn.  On the rare occasion when they need to be removed, the clippings are composted.

be our flagship sustainability program, there have been challenges in the past year; we had the coldest
winter on record resulting in increased heating energy demand, although conservation efforts allowed
Brown to actually decrease its energy use from the previous fiscal year by 2%. The cold winter played a
significant role in this increase, primarily because the New England electricity grid utilized more carbon
intensive fuels due to a shortage of natural gas pipeline infrastructure in the region, thereby increasing
the CO2
emissions per kilowatt-hour by 13%. That said, our GHG emissions increased from the previous
year by more than 3200 metric tons, leaving us at 22% below 2007 levels as compared to our interim
target of 28%. However, we are progressing towards reaching our goal of a 42% reduction in GHG
emissions by 2020 from our 2007 baseline as indicated by our ability to grow while still reducing overall
energy consumption – while New England electricity grid continues to invest in cleaner and renewable
energy sources and Brown continues to invest in energy efficiency.
Since inception of our GHG reduction plan, we have added new systems and equipment whose energy
consumption is equivalent is 6,400 Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (MTCDE), 9% of our 2007
baseline emissions. These systems and equipment will continue to grow as the campus meets its
research, teaching, and quality of life missions. Since 2008, we have already invested approximately $24
million for a net investment of $20 million after accounting for $4 million in energy efficiency incentives.
This has reduced our carbon footprint by almost 14,500 MTCDE, which is on track to meet our original
energy efficiency plan. Although opportunities for reductions continue to become harder to find, we
continue to invest in innovative technologies and systems to help achieve our 42% goal.

","Waste and Materials Management Working Group, Facilities Planning, Design and Construction as well as Physical Plant Management.",True,True,"CSUN is located in a region that is characterized by an insufficient supply of local water to serve its population. This problem was noted in the 1920s when the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California was established and will be increasingly evident as more and more demands are placed on water resources. The problem of inadequate local supply has been addressed by accessing water from the northern parts of the State and the Colorado River, but it appears inevitable that these sources will cease to be as effective in future in light of continued population growth and the effects of global warming.


Though comparatively the price of water is not as high as that of energy, water is a scarce and vital resource. The price of water is expected to increase in the next decade and beyond as larger populations increase the demand for this resource. Additionally, extracting, transporting and heating water require large amounts of energy, so being water wise also reduces our consumption of energy. CSUN’s commitment is to be a good steward of water resources, and to conserve wherever we can.

The CSU will develop employee and student workforce skills in the green jobs industry, promote the development of sustainable products and services, and foster economic development.""  A campus specific example of this at Sac State is the stormwater management, low impact development project, also known as implementation of rain gardens and bioswales.  In 2015, Sacramento State’s Office of Water Programs (OWP) and Facilities Management teamed up with the City of Sacramento to install new stormwater management devices on campus. The devices, or low impact development best management practices (LID BMPs), are intended to reduce stormwater impacts to the American and Sacramento Rivers. Stormwater runoff from urban development is one of the leading contributors of water quality degradation.  Another example of incorporating sustainability into curriculum is using the campus as a living lab by use of a sustainability signage trail.","The Sustainability Trail envisioned by the 2015 Master Plan would
be both a physical route through the campus and an overall philosophy underpinning the University’s commitment to sustainability education. The physical trail would extend from the Arboretum, the LEED-Gold American River Courtyard at the north end of campus, into the Main Quad and along the main stretch of the campus.
The Sustainability Trail would incorporate existing and planned features of the University’s sustainability program such as the stormwater management devices – with signage expressing how the LID project protect the American River and resident aquatic life from pollutants originating from campus.  Typically each location on the Sustainability Trail would have an interpretive sign describing the sustainability feature of the campus and how it functions.  In short, the Sustainability Trail has unlimited potential as a platform to promote the University’s excellence in an increasingly critical field of science and its contribution as a responsible partner with the community, the Sacramento region and the state of California.  By making the campus
into a living demonstration of sustainability, the University will attract not only the elementary school classes who currently visit the campus, but will draw the attention of the entire K-12 regional system as well as other regional higher education institutions.
The University Sustainability Committee has envisioned establishing a Sustainability Trail as an educational component of Sacramento State’s sustainability program.

Call for proposals deadline was May 29, 2015, with the review and selection period to follow.  

To launch the iWEST research agenda, the following types of research funding are available to the campus. All Unit 3 faculty (full-­‐time and part-­‐time) are eligible to apply (with possible limitations on award duration for instructional faculty based on appointment term and time base). There are three types of funding available, and applicants may receive only one of the following types of awards, and may apply by designating in their application a primary award objective and a secondary award objective if the first cannot be awarded. Co-investigators and collaborators may participate in more than one award, subject to the limitations above.
Preference will be given to applications and projects that demonstrate collaborative efforts among faculty, including both inter- and intra-­ college collaborations, with an award divided as requested among partners. Applications will be reviewed by a group of faculty and campus administrators with appropriate backgrounds in sponsored projects, externally-­‐funded research, and the iWEST disciplines, and may also include external experts in the field.
For the first two award options, successful applicants will demonstrate a track record or clear potential for grant funding, along with experience producing high-­‐quality research and sponsored project outcomes on time that illustrate the likelihood of continuing a dynamic research agenda with external support.

","1.	Irrigation
a.	Evaluation: We contracted with an independent consultant to conduct an evaluation of the campus-wide irrigation system, assessing 68 controllers and over 14,000 individual sprinkler heads.  
b.	Maintenance and repairs: As we make repairs, we install more efficient sprinkler heads that minimize over-spray.  Installation of new sprinkler heads reduces water use by 30% per head.
c.	Sprinkler control upgrades:  We are installing a new water efficient irrigation control system.  This improved system will allow us to schedule watering remotely and automatically and enable us to better evaluate how and when watering is needed.  
d.	Use of non-potable water use for irrigation: We only use non-potable water for irrigation and have reduced this use by 37% in the past year.
e.	Lawn replacement: We are installing native and drought-tolerant plants on all future landscaping projects.  We have installed rocks or decomposed granite in walking paths in place of turf. We have also installed block wall seating areas with low water use landscapes.    
f.	Lawn watering reduction: A turf reduction plan is currently being implemented.  We have reduced or completely shut off watering to select lawns around campus while being mindful of preserving campus trees.  To date we’ve ceased watering on 6.20 acres of lawn, which includes shutting off 610 sprinkler heads.  The total irrigation savings (based on twice weekly watering schedule) is 43,586 acre feet of water or 2,397,230 gallons of water saved annually.  (This does not include the athletic turf venues or turf areas that contain trees.)  Notable: Hornet Stadium has artificial turf.
g.	Mulching:  Increased mulching campus-wide retains soil moisture, reducing the need for watering.
h.	Reduced watering times: Reduced irrigation times by 25% on campus irrigation controllers in the past year.

2.	Domestic 
a.	Toilets and urinals: We received a rebate of $78,150 from the City of Sacramento to help fund the replacement of all pre-1992 toilets and urinals.  A total of 519 restroom fixtures have been replaced. The new toilets use only 1.28 gallons compared to the older models which use 4-6.  The new urinals use only .5 gallons, compared to the older models at 3-4 gallons.  The planned replacement of flush valves on the remaining 437 fixtures will provide an additional estimated 7-10% domestic water reduction.
b.	 Water meter installation:  Plans to install water meters on every building are currently in progress.  Adding these meters will improve overall operation and efficiency.
c.	Sinks:  Installation of new faucet aerators to bathroom sinks is part of the regular maintenance cycle and will continue on the remaining 75% of faucets.  This change-out decreases the water output to just 0.5 gallons per minute, compared to 2 gallons per minute with the old aerators. 
d.	Fountains:  Two decorative fountains have been shut down to prevent water loss from evaporation and signage posted explaining this is done in response to the drought.  This practice will continue moving forward. 
e.	Pool Cover:  Use of automated pool cover helps ensure water isn’t lost to evaporation.  This practice will continue moving forward.

Sustainability and the Environment, which the Board approved in February 2009. The
primary goal of the School will be to provide innovative, interdisciplinary education and
research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and professional students to better
prepare them to identify and solve challenges related to sustainability and the

The responsibility of the School’s dean will be to provide leadership of the School. ","Beginning in Fall 2015, Chatham has instituted new guidelines for general education requirements for undergraduate students. The following mission objectives pertain to the overall university's mission of promoting sustainability and the environment:

Sustainability and the Environment:
-Students will articulate the effects that humans have on the environment and how this impacts issues of health and social justice.
-Students will describe sustainable processes and systems and be able to apply that knowledge in the specific areas and societies under study.",Primarily Academic Affairs with the assistance of Falk School of Sustainability and the Office of Sustainability,True,True,"Chatham has been planning academic and other related programs for sustainability since 2008. A plan of academic programs in sustainable food studies, sustainability, women's health and the environment, etc., will be created with the prioritization of hiring faculty who conduct research in these fields. The 2008 Eden Hall Campus plan includes faculty/researchers in the following disciplines: Policy (1); health (1); sustainability/stewardship (1); nutritional anthropology (1); agriculture (1); global (1); building (1). ","Within the first 1-2 years of the Eden Hall Campus, Chatham will roll out 3-year bachelors degrees in Sustainable Living, Global Environmental Studies, Natural Resources Stewardship, Toxicology, and Ecotourism/Agritourism. These programs, along with the two existing bachelors programs in Environmental Studies and in Environmental Science, will share courses.

Within years 3-4, programs in geoinformatics, public health, and renewable energy will also be available for the undergraduate level.

In addition to appropriate professional skills and liberal arts learning, Chatham believes that world readiness means being an informed and engaged citizen in one’s communities; recognizing and respecting diversity of culture, identity and opinion; and living sustainably on the planet. 

Prior to revising the above statement, the President's Office released the ""Visioning 2014: A Vision for Chatham's Academic Future."" In the document, it was stated, ""Given the growing awareness of Chatham as a leader in sustainability, and the importance of the topic to all individuals, including professionals in the future, it makes sense that all students should have some necessary exposure to sustainability and to Eden Hall. The Chatham community needs to decide what form(s) that experience will take.""","Starting in Fall 2015, all undergraduate students will be required to engage in Eden Hall Practicum courses. These are designed to offer undergraduate students a hands-on Field Experience at the Eden Hall Sustainability campus. Faculty are encouraged to develop experiential courses with innovative content and formats that make use of the Eden Hall Campus environment (15 contact hours minimum, letter grade).

Learning Outcomes:

-After exploring the natural environment through experiential learning activities, students will be able to describe the geography, environment, culture, history and/or economy of the Eden Hall Campus.
-After completion of an Eden Hall Practicum, students will be able to summarize the sustainable systems of Eden Hall and the main principles of sustainability.","Student Affairs, Office of Sustainability",True,True,"Integrating sustainability into the fabric of the University will require a coordinated and
sustained University-wide effort of a kind rarely seen before. Coordination and
collaboration across all aspects of the University will be required because sustainability –
more than any of the other Mission Initiatives -- touches upon nearly every area of the
University: operations, curriculum, student life, research, and the University’s interaction
with everyone from community members to policy makers.

Chatham's Board of Trustees wrote in the ""Visioning 2014"" document: ""Our most recent thinking, as shaped by connections and opportunities that have arisen since the Master Plan was created, is that the outreach components of the Campus should be a key priority for next phases of development. That would include online and on ground degree offerings, as noted before, but also outreach to K-12 students and the policy broader. For example, students who often experience nature deprivation could be engaged positively with the campus.""  ","In Fall 2014, Chatham hired two full-time employees to coordinate public programming at the Eden Hall campus. Kelly Henderson was hired as the Sustainability and Education Coordinator for K-12 programming, and Angie Jasper was hired as Director of Cultural and Community Events hosted at the Eden Hall campus.

This includes protecting historic trees, vegetation, and gardens on our Shady Side Campus. In addition, the plan includes improvement to our campus arboretum which designates replanting vegetation (prioritizing native plants) compatible with historic designs. 

The 2012 Chatham University Tree Campus Plan's Purpose B states to ""Develop and maintain a safe, attractive, and sustainable campus and Arboretum,"" and purpose C states to ""Increase species diversity with a focus on native species.""

Within the Eden Hall Campus Master Plan (2011) Section 05: Natural Environment, the stated goals are to ""protect the streams and waterways, protect and restore 200 acres of the forest for teaching, research, and demonstration, and protect arable land by preserving productive landscape."" The Master Plan divided the campus into three environmental zones with specific assessment and recommendations for each zone: Green Zones - Preservation, Orange Zones - Arable Land and Agricultural Soils, and Grey Zones - Connections (Connect Campus Residents to Their Environment). Grey Zones are areas for future development and campus growth (""These areas are least critical to ecosystem preservation""). ","Chatham's Eden Hall campus is currently in the process of USDA Organic Certification for the student garden, Elsama fields, high tunnels, and all other areas of food production. The formal process of certification began in 2013.

We have begun with campus-wide policies covering paper purchasing, bottled water, and cleaning products. ","Paper purchasing objectives are to maintain a minimum of 30% post-consumer recycled content in all office paper purchases. We reduced paper use through paper quotas for department and students

Other than disinfectant products necessary to running a residential campus, Chatham has committed to green cleaning products and the removal of triclosan antibacterial soaps across all three campuses

Bottled water was banned from purchase in 2010 from all departments (catering, athletics, etc.) and continues to be so.",Office of Sustainability and Finance Department,True,True,"Within the Eden Hall Campus Master Plan, Transportation Section (p. 102) states: ""Eden Hall Campus strives to be a climate positive community. Transportation, both within the campus and between the Shadyside campus and Eden Hall plays an important role in achieving this goal. As the campus develops over time, the need for transit options to/from Pittsburgh will increase. While shuttles are the most likely short term solution, longer term plans for commuter rail, expanded bus service, and car sharing programs are options that offer far more efficient solutions than single occupancy vehicles."" 

Traffic Impact Study (p. 102): ""A traffic impact study concluded that Eden Hall Campus at full capacity will have minimal impact on the surrounding road network if appropriate mitigation is provided.""

Site Circulation (p. 102): ""A campus wide trail system will connect the major campus districts and accommodate convenient pedestrian and bicycle movement.""

In addition, p. 103 delineates a ""Diagram of proposed pedestrian, bicycle, and shuttle circulation."" ","Bike Works bike shop's objectives are indoor locked bike parking for commuters, covered outdoor bike parking, and regular opportunities for bicycle classes and maintenance. In Spring 2014, Chatham collaborated with Bike Pittsburgh to host the first annual Women and Biking Forum. 

We have also committed to fleet conversion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as close to zero as possible by purchasing hybird vehicles when available, providing hybrid vehicles for all campus police and maintaining a bicycle police force, and we are exploring the available technologies in transportation such as biodiesel and electric. In support of this goal, charging stations were installed at Eden Hall in Fall 2015. The facilities fleet at Eden Hall will be primarily electric. 

Our objective of offering multi-modal support for faculty, staff, and student commuters includes a coordinated, interlocking program of car sharing, bicycle rental, free bus passes, and free shuttles between campuses. ",Office of Sustainability and the Department of Public Safety,True,True,"The following information is written into our 2009 Climate Action Plan:

The Waste Minimization Working Group has been looking at ways to reduce the amount of Chatham trash headed to the landfills.  The committee has identified several areas of focus.  Some of these have more emissions data available than others, but all should work to reduce the emissions associated with our landfilled waste.  Without complete information at this time, we hypothesize a 1-2% reduction each year in solid waste emissions.

Composting Food Waste:
Chatham will complete its first year of food waste composting in September 2009.  Between September 2008 and May 2009, we composted 32.6 tons of food service waste.  We do extremely well with composted food waste at Anderson Dining Hall, but there are still gaps at Café Rachel and the Weathervane Snack Bar. Café Rachel, in particular, has some logistical issues due to the location on campus and the weight of the recycling containers, as well as truck access for the hauler. Chatham has been working with an area nonprofit organization to look at ways to overcome some of these barriers.  A report is expected by September 2009 from Pennsylvania Resources Council with their recommendations.

Increased Recycling of Plastics, Cans, Glass:
Chatham currently recycles 15% of its paper, cans, bottles and glass.  As we increase the recycling rate, we expect to see reductions in the emissions associated with landfilling.  This year, the winning schools in the RecycleMania competition were averaging 25-75% recycling rates.  Meeting these recycling rates will require investment in recycling bins around campus, including in faculty and staff offices as well as increasing the number of bins in public areas.

Paper Use Reduction:
Chatham has switched to 30% recycled content paper for all stocked copiers and printers.  We expect to see the savings from this switch when completing our inventory for next year. 

As an institutional measure, Chatham renegotiated a contract for copier and print services that specifies the default for printing be set to 2-sided,or duplex.  (There are still some legacy printers that don’t have the capability, but as they age, their replacements will.)  Switching to duplex printing will reduce paper usage on campus about 25%.  In addition, in February 2009, Printing Services replaced old copiers with those capable of printing double-sided, and set that as the default for printing. 

Non-recyclable Waste Reduction:
The Sustainability Office, in partnership with the Rachel Carson Institute and Student Affairs, is developing a plan for the establishment of a free store as a waste minimization option.  The free store is a cyclical model, to be operated by work study students.  The staff will collect used clothing, appliances, furniture, etc. from outgoing students as well as faculty and staff, for use by others.  Items will be relocated to a designated area, the “store,” for others to reclaim at no cost.  Establishing a free store year round will aid in curbing trash produced by the Chatham community.  In addition, a free store on campus will promote environmental consciousness while simultaneously providing students a free and time saving alternative to purchasing new items.  We will be able to monitor the waste kept out of the landfill through the inventory process (now under development).  The system will track the volume of reusable and reused items.   Our estimate for the amount that can be kept out of landfill is about 1 ton, calculated at ½ the average of other universities with more extensive space, larger population, and established programs have been able to do. ","Our measurable objectives include:
-Eliminate packaging or products that would require us to recycle as much as possible, including eliminating bottled water and disposable take out containers
-In Fall 2014, Chatham expanded the E-Waste Recycling program by installing E-Waste Recycling stations on all three campuses to collect batteries, CDs, ink jet and toner cartridges, and cell phones (which are donated to Hope Line or Cellphones for Soldiers)

An important strategy in our waste minimization efforts includes participating in the RecycleMania competition each year to encourage campus engagement. In the 2015 competition, our waste minimization rate was 38.467 lbs/person. By comparison, in 2010, our rate was 10.71 lbs/person. ","Office of Sustainability, Finance Department, and Facilities",True,True,"Under the Eden Hall Campus Master Plan: Water Systems Section (p. 110), the following plans are detailed regarding the university's water usage and reduction: 

Water and waste infrastructure are important educational components of Eden Hall Campus. While integrating biophilic water management systems into the built environment will certainly add interest and beauty, this strategy will also expose students, faculty, and visitors to the impacts that our behavior and technology have on the environment.

Layering the proposed water systems to serve multiple functions, Eden Hall Campus will far exceed conventional approaches of maintaining “water supply” and “waste disposal” networks. Wastewater treatment, greywater treatment, rainwater harvesting, effluent reuse, effluent dispersal, and nutrient cycling are all components of the proposed infrastructure at Eden Hall Campus.
 
Infrastructure must function well at all scales, from small start-up levels to the fully-developed campus level. The goal is to provide a flexible and adaptable framework that grows with the campus community and adapts to meet changing demands. Eden Hall Campus has the potential to use a natural systems approach and a modular, phased, and
decentralized concept for water and waste cycling.
 
Rainwater Harvesting:
Rainwater harvesting can provide non-potable water for irrigation and mechanical systems. Potable water can be produced from rainwater using additional filters and disinfection technology.
 
Natural Treatment Systems:
Natural treatment systems, including constructed wetlands and sand filtration, can provide greywater and blackwater treatment. Effluent could be recycled for irrigation and groundwater recharge, and integrated treatment systems would provide beauty, open space, wildlife habitat, and living classrooms. Water treatment systems are planned to be dispersed throughout the campus and installed in accordance with phased development at the site. Instead of taking water and waste “away,” these systems will enable residents to have daily interaction with an important natural system. The water systems are physically modeled after forest floor, meadow, wetland, and pond edge habitats. These ecological zones will be incorporated into the proposed technological solutions for managing
campus water and waste. Faculty, students and visitors will discover engaging lessons within these water systems and are encouraged to visit, explore, and advance these concepts found at Eden Hall Campus.","Chatham's objectives are: 
-To continue installing rain gardens on all campuses; with 6 currently in place and another 6 in planning stages. 
-Increase the installation of porous pavement whenever possible, including the retrofit of our Eastside parking lot in cooperation with the City of Pittsburgh. 
-Expand our rainwater capture program, including the underground rainwater storage at Eden Hall and the rain barrel program for smaller buildings. 
-In cooperation with the City of Pittsburgh, work on the redesign of Fifth Avenue properties' stormwater runoff patterns. ",Office of Sustainability ,True,True,"Diversity:

Under the ""Visioning 2014: A Vision for Chatham's Academic Future and Elements for a New Strategic Plan,"" the President's Office revised the mission statement of the university: 

""The current “Mission Initiatives” should be integrated into a new statement of the mission as modalities for the execution of the mission to professionalism and personal development. The restatement of the mission initiatives appears in the new mission as:
In addition to appropriate professional skills and liberal
learning, Chatham believes that world readiness means being an informed and engaged citizen in one’s communities; recognizing and respecting diversity of culture, identity and opinion; and living sustainably on the planet. This restatement differs from the original initiatives only somewhat in substance, but more in nuance. “International” appears as communities and diversity of culture (permitting domestic exploration as well) and the mission to “gender and
women’s leadership” appears as both civic engagement and
identity, the latter a matter of almost equal significance to
gender during the debates over coeducation"" (p. 8). 

In addition, in March 2013, the Office of Student Affairs updated their Learning Outcomes document, which is an institutional plan to outline learning outcomes for all Chatham graduates. On page 2, the relevant outcomes listed under ""Central Student Affairs & Dean of Students,"" are as follows: 

2. Multicultural Programming: As a result of participating in co-curricular activities, students will…
* Participate in a celebration of diversity.
* Describe and discuss the different aspects of diversity.
* Analyze the concept of privilege and explain how privilege has shaped their worldview.
* Create a diversity action plan aimed at developing knowledge, skills and awareness.

7. Retention Programs (Early Alert/Targeted Group/etc.): As a result of Chatham retention efforts, students will…
* Describe barriers to retention and how those barriers impact their own retention.
* Describe the resources available to students on campus.
* Participate in workshops and demonstrate skills.

8. Targeted Student Groups: As a result of Chatham retention effort, students will…
* Identify the student affairs resource person responsible for their student group.
* Describe resources available to their student group.
* Interact with others in their student group once per semester.

Affordability:

Chatham University's ""Vision 20/20"" document, originally adopted by the Board of Trustees in 2008, describes in Section B: Increase Financial Resource Needs: 

""A concern for affordability for our students is also crucial as we seek to grow and receive
greater recognition in the future. We have done better in recent years, bringing our
undergraduate scholarship discount amount into greater control due to better management of aid awarding and having more endowed scholarships due to the generosity of many alumnae in the last Campaign. The more endowed scholarships there are, the better able we are to recruit the outstanding students who are so pressed by today’s high college costs and their parents’ savings patterns. As of 12/31/08, we had $8.5 million in endowed scholarship funds (down 26% in fiscal 2009) which yield $600,000 a year.
These funds are very important, but insufficient compared to the nearly $6 million in awards we gave to undergraduates in fiscal 2008. These are operating dollars which
cannot be directed to other salary or operational needs. On average we currently “gap”
(do not make available) $6,500 of need to our undergraduate students, who are left to
their own resources (largely private, unsubsidized loans) to find the remaining funding
after the Chatham aid awards and the federal and state grants. Our students are
graduating with very high debt, which is a strong incentive to students to leave the
institution before graduating, thus worsening our retention and graduation rates. The cost
of higher education is a complex issue, and “affordability” involves more than just increasing student aid or controlling costs and charges. It is an issue we will continue to study in our quest to find ways (e.g., paid internships, co-op opportunities, and innovative
work programs which would benefit students while also allowing us to hire fewer staff)
to help our students graduate with less of a financial burden.

Our graduate students also have issues with affordability. Currently we offer no, or very
limited, graduate assistantships. While we never expect to operate like a traditional research university (where most doctoral students anticipate a full, or nearly full tuition award plus a living stipend), even as a Master’s Medium institution we should have the resources to bring in some of the outstanding graduate students who must now forego the opportunity to study here. A goal is to put more graduate students and faculty to work through assistantships and research. We cannot be recognized as a quality and innovation leader, a key to our strongest future growth, if we do not also make it possible to recruit the students and faculty of highest quality to our institution. Providing no graduate fellowships will be an impediment to our growth in quality and to our growth as well, as students seek first to apply to institutions where they have some hope of receiving some aid"" (pp. 20-21). ","Employees who participate in the Fit for the Future campaign and meet the goals outlined by the program have gotten their annual healthcare deductible waived by UPMC. 

Based on surveys conducted during both mid-semester (called a ""Temperature Check"") and at the end of the semester, the Office of Student Affairs is able to assess whether the needs of minority or non-traditional students are being met. Students are able to address specific issues which are then directed by the Office of Student Affairs to faculty or staff member that is able to work with the student to address the issue. This process has increased retention and contributed to the university's diversity advancement initiatives. 

In 2015, the GSA Student Leadership and Student Organization Award for ""Outstanding Diversity Program"" went to the Psychology of Gender Student Research Team. 

Chatham participates in the Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program), which is a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. This program is voluntary for private institutions, and provides matching funds from the Department of Veterans Affairs as a supplement to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Post-9/11 GI Bill covers tuition and fees not to exceed the maximum in-state tuition & fees at a public Institution of Higher Learning. The Yellow Ribbon Program will match tuition and fees in excess of the portion funded by the GI Bill. The Yellow Ribbon Program covers tuition and mandatory fees and does not include room and board or books and supplies which are provided for separately under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. These benefits will replace merit scholarships awarded at the time of acceptance. Chatham University has elected to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program since the program's inception. ",Human Resources and Office of Student Affairs ,True,True,"The 2009 Climate Action Plan details the following action steps for bicycle support, written by the Chatham University Transportation Working Group:

""Institutional support of bicycle commuting, including city bike maps, dispensers of patch
kits and innertubes, access to tools with simple written directions for use, lessons in
simple bike mechanics, a shower facility on the north side of campus (in the Chapel,
Woodland, Braun/Falk/Coolidge or Buhl) and increased/sheltered bike parking facility. Start a program where experienced riders pair with less experienced cyclists interested in riding to work. Work with Human Resources to incorporate bike commuting into the wellness program credit"" (p. 22).

In addition, the Human Resources 3-Year Strategic Plan and Goals document outlines the following goals to advance participation in Chatham's ""Fit for the Future"" program, which was established in 2004 as part of the university's health and wellness goals:

1. Develop 2013 goals in which employees must complete a certain number of credits for recognition and to avoid an annual deductible in 2014.
2. Engage more employees in the Fit for the Future Program. By increasing employee engagement, this will lead to a healthier workforce.  ","In 2014, over 80% of Chatham University employees met their Take a Healthy Step (TAHS) goals through our Fit for the Future campaign. For the 2015 year, employees have until the end of September to sign up for the program. 

Along with the Fit for the Future program, Chatham has instituted the Federal Commuter Bike Credit Program in 2004. Employees who sign up for this benefit are not permitted to have a campus parking permit as they are required to certify that cycling is their primary mode of transportation to and from work during the time frame in which they receive the reimbursement. The maximum reimbursement is $20 per month or $240 over a calendar year. 

Chatham has provided full benefits to same-sex couples since 2002, which is one of our strategies to attract diversity in hiring. In addition, unskilled minority employees can elect to join training and certificate programs as well as receive full access to a Chatham undergraduate education. ",Human Resources and Office of Sustainability,True,True,"In January 2015, Chatham University updated its ""Endowment Fund: Statement of Investment Guidelines."" Under the Section titled ""Investment Philosophy,"" Sustainability is included as one of the elements ""designed to capture the overall philosophical thinking with regard to the investment program of the Endowment Fund."" Sustainability is described as follows:

""While the primary responsibility of the Investment Committee is to oversee the management of the University’s endowment to generate real asset growth for the long-term, the University is also concerned with demonstrating its commitment to sustainability within its investment portfolio.

Goal or Measurable Objective: To reach a 35% recycling rate by 2018.
How:  This goal will be reached by extreme focus in the areas of recycling accessibility, food waste diversion, and educational outreach.  There will continue to be a focus on proper bin placement throughout outdoor areas, new structures, and existing structures. Recycling accessibility will be an extreme focus on our path to a 35% recycling rate.  Recycling must be convenient at a university for student compliance and we must improve in this area.  The classroom and office buildings are appropriately occupied with recycling options but we need to match this accessibility for housing areas on campus. The first step we will take is to place 8 yard comingle recycling containers next to the trash dumpsters outside of the Elvington Buildings.  Mirroring a recycling bin next to a trash container is the same concept that is currently used on the inside of classroom and office buildings across campus.  This method has proven to be very convenient and effective for students.  The containers will be placed in the summer of 2015, during the opening of Phase 1, and continue throughout the other phases. 
Secondly, we will improve the recycling options at University Place, and all the main campus living areas.  We will add another 30 yard comingle container at University Place to help with convenience for student recyclers. The third thing we will do is to keep a continued focus on getting recycling bins in the rooms of students who live on campus.  Gathering email addresses, displaying the bins at events, and Eco-Rep communication will all remain tactics for getting bins in the hands of students.   Furthermore, an Eco-Rep will be hired that will specialize in educating students who live on campus. This person will be responsible for communicating the information on how to receive a bin for their room.   The Eco-Rep for housing areas will be hired by August, 2016. 
Food waste diversion is another extreme focus area in the plan.  Our partnership with dining services is crucial to reaching the goal that has been outlined.  The pre-consumer food diversion efforts are currently in place and working well.  That program has been expanded to cover Hicks Dining Hall, Cino Grille, and the Catering Building.  The UP Café will be added to the pre-consumer food waste schedule upon completion of the renovations.  During the summer of 2015 we will begin to analyze how much food waste is actually being disposed of and what the post-consumer composting program should look like. Post-consumer composting will need to begin by August, 2017, once the proper methods have been determined.  The introduction of a post-consumer composting program could result in over a ton of trash per week being diverted from the landfill.  
As mentioned in previous paragraphs, educational outreach will continue to be a major focus for waste diversion efforts.  Educating staff, faculty, and students on what is recyclable and where they can recycle is extremely critical.  This will be done through presentations by Eco-Reps, the distribution of green guides to all students living on campus, materials being distributed at sustainability events, orientation fairs, and RA fairs. 
In conclusion, we can divert more waste from the landfill by focusing on the improvement of our recycling rate.  We will move this number significantly through concentrated efforts on recycling convenience, food waste diversion, and educating the people who are on campus.   
","Goal or Measurable Objective: To reach a 35% recycling rate by 2018. This 30 yard container should be added during the summer of 2015.  Eventually, the goal will be to remove one dumpster at each location at University Place and replace it with an 8 yard comingle recycling container.  This would also occur at Ingle, Palmetto, Eaglin, and Cypress Halls.   This is the most convenient option for students and would provide uniformity across living areas.

The Sustainability Across the Curriculum workshop is a two-day faculty development workshop that has taken place directly after the end of classes May 2014 and May 2015. It was designed to support faculty in incorporating sustainability learning in courses broadly across the curriculum (not only in the environmental sciences). Ten professors participated in the workshop in 2014 and 2015. The workshop included programming on foundational sustainability concepts, health and wellness, local history and sense of place. There was also time for open discussion and brainstorming ideas for courses. The goal was to support professors in redesigning an existing course or developing a new course that would focus on sustainability issues or incorporate a unit or module on sustainability. Faculty received a $500 stipend for participating in the workshop, with another $500 upon completion and approval for a course re-design. In addition, the participants are part of a continuing program as Faculty Sustainability Scholars. The scholars come together once a semester to discuss progress in developing courses. The will also hopefully provide support for future participants in the workshop. The workshop will be a yearly occurrence from here into the future.

7. Honnen Firm Natural Gas Transportation
The Honnen firm natural gas transportation project is a change in the way we buy natural gas at our Honnen Ice Arena. Currently we are on an interruptible rate meaning Colorado Springs Utilities can stop natural gas delivery to us at any time. When this happens, Honnen Ice Arena is without heat. This project moves us from interruptible service to firm service meaning our service cannot be interrupted. For this project the College will utilize its existing contract to purchase natural gas from ontinuum Energy.

8. El Pomar Electrical Service Upgrades
The El Pomar electrical service upgrades project will either split the buildings electrical service or combine it with the central plant to reduce cost. Due to demand at El Pomar the building experiences rates as high as $018/kWh which is more than double the campus average of $0.085/kWh. The buildings use profile is unique because its peak demand occurs between 4 pm and 10 pm during the winter which is an on‐ peak period. During this time student are utilizing the fitness center and the field lights at on. During this same period, the central chiller plant is idle and could supply the additional capacity required. 

9. Central Plant Controls Upgrade Phase 2
The central plant controls upgrade phase 2 project will improve the automation of the central plant heating operation. The controls work includes adding controls and system logic to enable remote starting and automate temperature modulation of the high temperature hot water generators and distribution system pumps. These controls optimize central heating plant reliability and efficiency. The project will expand alarms for safety allowing the plant to be controlled remotely and left unmanned for extended periods beyond just the summer. The extended periods of time will allow central plant operators time to perform maintenance activities on the distribution system and respond to after‐hours emergencies on campus.

10. Barnes Repair 1st & 3rd Floor Heating Piping
Barnes repair 1st & 3rd floor piping is the third phase of piping repairs in Barnes Science Center. The project includes work to weld leaky Victaulic fittings and replace pneumatic controls on the 1st & 3rd floor. The project saves energy because the old piping must be maintained at higher operating temperatures through the summer to prevent leaking. Welding the piping will allow heating system temperatures to be setback in the summer.

11. Cutler HVAC System Replacement
This project will replace the existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems at Cutler Hall. Currently Cutler utilizes steam for heating provided from Bemis Hall. The systems do not have good zone control, so as a result occupants are often too hot or too cold. The new system will utilize a new variable refrigerant flow heat pump system to maximize occupant comfort and efficiency while maintaining the historic characteristics of the building. The system will also help support renovation to repurpose the second floor of the facility.

12. Cornerstone Retro‐Commissioning
The Cornerstone retro‐commissioning project will reduce the overall energy intensity at Cornerstone Arts Center. The project is to evaluate the operation of building systems and return them to the intended design parameters. From there additional savings opportunities will be identified and pursued to maximize the buildings energy performance. Currently the building utilizes large quantities of outside air. As part of this project we will attempt to minimize the amount of conditioned air that leaves the building when indoor air quality is at acceptable levels. In many cases commissioning work also improves occupant comfort.","1. This goal will contribute to the carbon neutrality goal by 2020 while also reducing emissions and helping department who use funding for high-energy lab equipment.

2. The Tutt Library Design Review will result in: Net zero building energy use; Net zero carbon emissions; Reduced annual energy costs; Reduced total building envelope performance; Reduced artificial lighting; A building that educates occupants about its sustainable features and how to properly use them; and a building that supports campus recycling practices all by 2017.

For this strategy, CSU would acquire significant wind power assets and take advantage of the favorable wind power generation conditions on CSU lands. Projects may involve partnering with third-parties, or may involve collaborating with other institutions. Such projects would reduce CSU’s carbon footprint and create opportunity for University research.   There are two phases to this strategy in the Climate Action Plan (CAP).  One phase is medium term (3-10 years), while the other phase is long term (> 10 years).  Current feasibility studies at the CSU facility near Akron, CO show great promise for meeting these goals.

The Climate Action Plan can be viewed at http://www.fm.colostate.edu/sustain/index.cfm?page=initiatives/cap.",True,True," 4.1 Building Energy Efficiency
The University has made significant strides in increasing building energy efficiency and identifying conservation opportunities in a number of its facilities. This strategy focuses on a number of energy efficiency opportunities, grouped into six phases, which can be implemented over the short (0-3 years), medium (3-10 years), and long term (>10 years) based on anticipated payback. These strategies are largely based on energy assessments completed for CSU in 2009. While some projects have been funded and are underway, more than 100 potential projects have been identified, including:
• Lighting upgrades 
• Controls upgrades
• Heat Recovery 
• Variable-air-volume terminals
• Synchronous belt drives 
• Heat-exchanger upgrades
• Demand control ventilation

4.4 Re-Commissioning and Retro-Commissioning
The strategy expands on and will be used to refine efforts currently being implemented by CSU to recommission or retro-commission its existing buildings. It includes both short (0-3 years) and medium (3-10 years) term goals and the resources to conduct commissioning and implement changes in all of the buildings on CSU’s local campuses. 
Commissioning is a quality assurance process that takes place after construction of a new building is complete, while re-commissioning essentially consists of a “tune-up” of an existing building’s mechanical and control systems. Commissioning verifies that building systems are performing as intended. Retro-commissioning, or commissioning of existing buildings for the first time (as opposed to re-commissioning), optimizes building systems so that they operate efficiently and effectively, resulting in reduced energy use and increased occupant comfort.

4.15  Improvements in New Construction 
Buildings are the major users of energy on the CSU campus and nationwide. According to the U.S. Green Building Council, in the U.S. today buildings consume approximately 70 percent of electricity and account for nearly 40 percent of CO2 emissions. As a result, in addition to exploring energy efficiency in existing buildings, this plan also includes a focus on high-performance building in new construction. All new major construction on CSU’s campus is being designed to a standard of LEED Gold or higher, resulting in higher performing, more energy-efficient buildings.  This strategy is being implemented now & is considered on-going.

This strategy builds on a pilot project already implemented - the installation of a biomass boiler - by adding a second boiler or cogeneration facility to provide energy for campus operations. This strategy is a medium term (3-10 year) goal.

4.5  Net Metered Solar Facilities 
This strategy includes net metering of existing solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities on CSU’s Main Campus, Foothills Campus, and at Chrisman Field that have been installed since the fiscal year 2009 inventory. Net metering is a policy that allows owners to take full credit for the cost of the electricity that their solar energy system produces and thereby reduces the amount of electricity that CSU has to purchase from the grid and the emissions associated with that electricity.  Solar projects on campus fall into short (0-3 years) and long-term (>10 years) in the Climate Action Plan.  The goals set for the short term have already been realized.  Add'l systems now underway will help meet the long-term goals when environmental attributes revert to the university in the future.

4.9 Computer Power Management and Server Virtualization
The objective of this strategy is to explore how to improve efficiency by reducing redundancies in common functions in information technology (IT) across campus, resulting in more streamlined and efficient IT services and more standardized power management practices. This strategy is a medium term (3-10 year) goal.

Denison’s campus is pedestrian-friendly. While the college is nearly 100% residential, 
86% of faculty and staff commute to work each day.  With a desire to increase off-campus community engagement, particular attention will need to be placed on providing viable transportation options and alternatives that align with broader sustainability goals and benefit the whole community.

We need to push this initiative by identifying Dickinson’s unique approach to sustainability, defining more fully the place of sustainability in the curriculum and taking full advantage of sustainability’s potential for enhancing active learning by tying curriculum to operations, service and the wider world. One definite focus for us must be melding our international and sustainability initiatives to create a global sustainability dimension unique among American colleges and universities. Most immediately, we must fully endow the Center for Sustainability Education. - P. 14","Dickinson offers over 100 courses each academic year that help students gain knowledge about sustainability concepts, problems and solutions while building competencies and dispositions for creating a sustainable world. Over time, these courses have been integrated throughout the Dickinson curriculum in over 39 academic departments. In fall 2015, the Class of 2019 onward will be required to take a sustainability course as part of the general degree requirements.

These courses address the question, “How do we improve the human condition equitably in this and future generations, while conserving environmental systems necessary to support healthy and vibrant societies?”

Dickinson offers numerous courses in arts and humanities, social sciences and laboratory sciences that explore the different dimensions of sustainability from a variety of perspectives. Over 96%* of our Class of 2015 graduates took a sustainability course during their studies at Dickinson, without requirement (*this doesn't include courses taken abroad).

Dickinson students can identify sustainability courses using the course designations Sustainability Investigations (SINV) or Sustainability Connections (SCON) when conducting an online course search.

Strategic Goal B: Dickinson has achieved a position of national leadership in sustainability education, in no small part as a result of the efforts of our facilities staff to “green” the campus. We must continue to apply the goal of greater sustainability as a key criterion in operations and in facility renovation and construction for reasons of greater efficiency, meeting our responsibilities under the Presidents’ Climate Commitment and enhancing our learning environment.

Objective 1. One integral element of our sustainability initiative is to turn the campus into a “living laboratory” by adding an educational dimension to green operations and projects. As indicated in the report of our 2010 Sustainability Symposium: “In creating a productive learning environment and working campus infrastructure, campus operations must be a platform for curricular and co-curricular learning experiences, not a separate physical entity.” 

Objective 2. We must in the next five years undertake projects and continue to operate in ways that advance us toward the goals set in Dickinson’s climate action plan.

Campus Circulation
Parking lots represent opportunities for redevelopment for buildings and open spaces, provided that parking demands can be satisfied elsewhere. Dickinson’s commitment to reduce its carbon footprint demands that the necessity of driving alone onto campus by anyone be challenged, and that viable alternatives be promoted.

Strategies
Integrate a strong pedestrian pathway and a bikeway system into existing circulation corridors like the roadway network and the rail corridor. Since a large part of the campus is a streetscape, converting these into “Green Corridors” will help to integrate pedestrian and bike linkages into the existing right of ways and create a pedestrian friendly campus. - P. 35

Proposed Path System
Promoting a pedestrian friendly campus will involve creating new walkways, consolidating existing ones, improving crosswalks, and providing shaded walkways.
Strategies:
• Create pedestrian linkages between different neighborhoods of the campus and integrate bike lanes into the circulation system. This will shorten perceived distances and promote a walkable Campus.
• Develop an appropriate hierarchy of paths based on function. This will contribute to ease of pedestrian movement on the Campus and eliminate redundant paths and excess pavement.
• Integrate speed tables or traffic calming structures at pedestrian crosswalks to improve pedestrian safety.
• Develop a comprehensive system of signage within the campus to support an enhanced circulation system. Strategically locate way finding, building, and interpretive signage at “nodes”, destinations, intersections, and outdoor sustainability demonstration areas around the campus. - P. 35

Landscape Management
Managing Stormwater
Increased stormwater runoff from developed areas is one of the most pervasive problems of an urbanizing world. While the opportunity exists to capture stormwater runoff and allow it to infiltrate the soil mantle, the conventional approach has been to treat the runoff as a drainage problem and to “solve” the problem with engineering solutions. These solutions are expensive, require a lot of maintenance, remove natural habitat, are usually unattractive, and ultimately not sustainable. Promoting open space development that is based on sustainable principles will also involve integrating sustainable alternatives to conventional stormwater management. Demonstration projects can be incorporated into site development associated with new buildings as well as retrofits. These projects can be based on models that replicate the natural hydrologic cycle.
Strategies:
• Identify small-scale projects that have the potential to capture and divert existing run-off into landscape features designed for storage, conveyance and reuse. These retrofit opportunities can be made economically viable in conjunction with new buildings, building improvements or site improvement projects.
• Integrate stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP’s) like rain gardens, green roofs, cisterns, retention ponds, bio-filtration swales, and pervious pavement into site and building design. These landscape features can be designed to discreetly fit within the urban landscape or integrated into planting areas. For instance, the redesign of the site and landscape behind Alt House can include disconnecting roof drains and diverting them into a rain garden, creating a green roof on the existing footprint of the
Central Utility Plant (CUP).
• Develop campus wide landscape “management” strategy to convert lawn areas in parts of the campus into an ecological landscape using native plantings. This will help to reduce storm run-off from these areas and provide screening, ecological, aesthetic, and other intangible benefits to the campus. 

Due to the karst geology in this area all the Best Management Practices should be carefully designed to prevent development of sinkholes. - P. 52

Strategic Goal B
Objective 2. Diversity. The ratio of students of color in the national school-age cohort is rising rapidly, and Dickinson has made notable strides in raising their representation. Our goal for the next five years is 12 percent or better, sustaining and improving on our recent progress. To do so, we must increase our wealth and/or reach into those highly sought-after sectors of students of color with both high academic ability and means to pay all or a significant portion of tuition. In addition, there are segments of the Jewish student population whom we have not reached. Dickinson provides key requirements for many Jewish students: a robust Judaic Studies curriculum, a nationally-recognized Hillel and ties with Israeli universities and the South American Jewish community. With a kosher dining option now added, we should be able to reach new segments of the Jewish population. - P. 9

Strategic Goal D
Objective 3. In regard to diversity and urban recruitment, opportunities include expanded relationships with community-based organizations (CBOs). These identify students in under-served high schools with the skills and desire for success in a highly selective college setting. Our work with CBOs can broaden diversity in terms of both students of color and socioeconomic background. For international students, a strong relationship and recruiting model comprised of targeted American and international schools abroad, as well as alumni volunteers and the availability of financial aid to highly talented students, will enable the college to continue to grow recruitment. Lastly, we must continue to develop relationships with independent schools across the board. - P. 10 - 11


The Dickinson Student Experience 
Strategic Goal C. Diversity. Strategic Plans I and II identified diversity as a critically important goal. While continuing strong efforts in recruitment, hiring, and academic program, we need also to focus on deepening the dimension of diversity in the student life experience.

Demographic data and student surveys confirm that diversity may—beyond its obvious significance to any 21st century educational program—in some aspects distinguish Dickinson from regional peers. In the 2010 senior survey, for example, our graduates reported an enhanced ability to relate to people of different races beyond that of our comparison institutions. 
Still, many graduating seniors report “no change” or “weaker” skills related to diversity. It remains relatively easy for students to avoid sustained interaction with people from diverse backgrounds and with diverse ideas and perspectives, particularly outside the classroom. 
Housing options, dining hall culture and strong student identification with clubs, teams, and fraternities and sororities often prompt students to find and maintain an identity with a homogenous campus sub-community.
Objective 1. 
We need to extend and deepen student life programming around diversity, reducing our reliance on one-time programs as a framework for diversity education beyond the classroom in favor of more sustained efforts. For example, we must develop a residentially based peer education program with clearly articulated outcomes as part of a substantive first-year residential program. More broadly, resident advisors, orientation advisors, club and organization officers and athletic team captains are all cohorts of student leaders who represent the college and have significant social influence over peers. We should provide these students with training to develop leadership and understanding around issues of diversity and privilege to in turn positively influence and educate other students. 
Objective 2.
 Building a supportive and inclusive community characterized by respect, equality and accountability is a priority. This goal requires both strategies to promote a pluralistic, integrative and accepting campus culture and to address what counteracts such a culture. In building such a community, we will extend full participation in campus life to individuals and organizations which embrace our community standards and values. So, for example, we should expand services and support for LGBTQ students, and enhance campus education to foster a more inclusive and safe environment for individuals. Or, in another area of diversity, we need to address facilities shortcomings in spaces that support students’ spiritual and religious faith expression from a variety of traditions. At the same time, we should refuse participation to organizations that do not embrace our Community Standards (Code of Conduct). And we must formulate and disseminate a bias incident response protocol to our campus as a tangible representation of our commitment to address intolerance.

Objective 3. It is vitally important that students experience meaningful opportunities to learn from sustained interaction with people from diverse backgrounds and with diverse experiences and perspectives. In particular, we should evaluate the current special interest/theme housing options to make sure that our desires to support group interests are not at the expense of a residential experience in which students are, without exception, interacting with and learning from the rich diversity of the student body. - P 15 ","Building Our Community of Students: Enrollment Management

Steps include: 1) completing initiatives to reduce sexual assault such as implementing a peer educator program and introducing a required module on sexual assault as part of the pre-college education expected of all students, 2) implementing an education/intervention program (drawing on our new hazing policy), particularly for student populations known to be at greatest risk and 3) translating findings of a current research study on campus alcohol use into a comprehensive plan for improving the campus climate around alcohol—this plan to address social norms, risk management and education, assessment and interventions related to student conduct, and environmental support/management.

Objective 4. With the arrival of a new Director of the Counseling Center, we must draft a strategic plan that will expand the focus of the counseling center beyond therapy and crisis intervention, to include outreach, education, greater emphasis on developmental concerns, an orientation toward positive psychology and helping students bolster their resilience in the face of stress and other difficulties. - P. 18

Started in 2010, The Duke Trillium Project is a faculty learning community dedicated to increasing the prevalence and quality of sustainability’s three core concepts (environment, economy, society) in Duke’s academics. The project conducts an annual campus workshop where “graduates” of prior Trillium Project workshops mentor faculty in effectively incorporating these core concepts into syllabi across all disciplines and departments. As of FY15, 70 Duke Trillium Fellows have completed the workshop. 

 In 2012, Duke created the position of Faculty Director of Sustainability, held by Dr. Charlotte Clark, to help formalize the University’s commitment to promoting sustainability education. 

The Duke Green Classroom Certification was also created in 2012 to provide faculty with the opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of their courses and classrooms while demonstrating eco-friendly behaviors to students. For 14-14 academic year there were 91 certified courses, reaching 2,721 students. 

","Continued development of an undergraduate, experiential certificate in Sustainability Engagement that includes 450 hours of experiential learning outside the classroom, which is slated to be approved in the Fall of 2015.

Initiated pilot of an international Sustainability Literacy Test on campus to assess changes in undergraduate sustainability literacy and skill development at the beginning and end of their Duke careers.

Over 400 courses with sustainability-related content were offered to students in academic year 2014-2015.

Continued to train faculty to integrate sustainability
into their courses with the Trillium Program. As of FY14, 9 external participants and 54 Duke Trillium Fellows have completed the workshop

Opportunities include: Bass Connections, group Master’s projects, in-class research projects, and more. ","In 2013, Sustainable Duke worked with the Office of Research Support to utilize the Sponsored Projects Systems Database to search by key word for sustainability related research funded in the past three years. This identified research in numerous departments across Duke focusing on a myriad of sustainability themes. 

Duke has conducted several preliminary inventories of sustainability research, developed a more concrete definition of sustainability research and is working to label such research in a more proactive manner. In particular, students have completed multiple research projects that inform our strategy for achieving climate neutrality, including Bass Connections in Energy projects (solar discount program and campus digester feasibility study), Group Masters Projects (identifying the ideal carbon offsets portfolio), and Undergraduate sustainability projects (identifying energy savings measures, composting opportunities, and more).

Hosted the new Unpark Yourself Challenge alternative transportation competition for employees and graduate students in spring 2015. 2000 people participated and three grand prize winners were selected to receive an ELF, which is a solar and foot powered, enclosed, recumbent bike. 

Over FY15, the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative (DCOI) piloted a program for Duke employees to install solar panels on their homes at a 10-20% discount. This pilot will test the ability of Duke University to generate greenhouse gas emission reductions through these employee-based residential solar installations.Free residential solar assessments were provided to 294 employees. Twenty-nine of these employees plan to install solar on their homes, totaling 152 kilowatts of solar capacity. Once installed, these solar panels will provide the clean energy equivalent to changing 2,000 incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent bulbs annually. Over the life of the panels, that is equivalent to changing more than 50,000 light bulbs. ",Sustainable Duke,True,True,"Through the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative, which was created in 2009, Duke is working with the local community to find carbon offset opportunities. 

The DCOI has developed a portfolio approach to generating carbon offsets, focusing on

The FY15 greenhouse gas inventory shows significant progress towards this goal with a 19% reduction of overall GHG emissions from a 2007 baseline.,"Created a five-year retrospective report on the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative (DCOI) and recommendations for moving forward. With 10 years left before 2024, continued exploration of local offset opportunities, financial planning for these projects and leveraging of Duke’s ability to influence local carbon offsets development is essential.

The DCOI, in partnership with faculty from the Nicholas Institute and Sanford School of Public Policy and undergraduate/graduate students at Duke University, researched and developed a Solarize Duke campaign. This program provided free solar assessments to over 300 Duke employees and 29 employees installed a total of 152 kilowatts of solar on their rooftops. This research was done through an interdisciplinary program called Bass Connections at Duke University. 

Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative completed evaluation of a pre-pilot energy efficiency program and found that participating houses reduced energy use by an average of 13%. Pre-pilot experience has informed a new Employee Energy Efficiency Pilot program that will assist employees in completing energy saving retrofits on their homes and assess the offset potential of these efforts. In FY15, the DCOI enrolled 26 Duke employees in the residential energy efficiency program. Each participant received a free home energy audit, access to a low-interest rate loan, and a list of recommended local contractors. 50% of participants went ahead with some of the energy efficiency improvement recommendations based on the energy audit. There is one more round of the program and then the DCOI will write a best practices report to help inform future programs.

From Emory's Climate Action Plan:
Individual Action
Though this report has focused heavily on institutional actions that units of Emory University can take, the individuals that comprise our community are essential to the success of the Climate Action Plan. Small steps that seem insignificant to each individual add up cumulatively to major change in overall emissions. Students, faculty, staff, and administrators are partners in sustainability efforts and part of our plan will be
education and encouragement to participate in actions that reduce carbon emissions, conserve resources, and preserve ecosystems.Particular success in supporting sustainability-related individual actions have come from the on-line Sustainability Pledge, which encourages new behavioral choices, provides a forum for friendly competition and includes a greenhouse gas reduction calculator.","Please see Emory's Sustainability Vision: http://sustainability.emory.edu/uploads/press/2012/03/2012031411311814/Emory_Sustainability_Vision.pdf

",True,True,"The Emory University Climate Action Plan was developed through the cooperation of two presidentially-appointed committees created in 2010: The Climate Action Plan Committee, made up of faculty, staff, and students, and the Carbon Reduction Taskforce, made up of staff members from Campus Services. Together, they studied the issues and opportunities, assessed feasibility, gathered campus advice and support, and put forward the following ambitious, yet achievable, goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction for Emory University (from a 2005 baseline):By 2020: 20% reduction in total emissions, 35% reduction per square foot. By 2036 (Emory’s 200th anniversary year): 36% reduction in total emissions, 50% reduction per square foot. By 2050: 50% reduction in total emissions, 85% reduction per square foot. The recommendations of the Climate Action Plan propose a comprehensive approach to reach these goals, offering emission reduction strategies in the categories of sustainable building and construction, energy, transportation, waste management, food, procurement, academic programs, and individual action. Each academic and several operational units of the university are asked to choose specific strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to report their progress annually.Updates to future master plans and strategic plans of the university will also include steps for achieving these plans. ","The Climate Action Plan Committee and the Carbon Reduction Task Force affirmed the following ambitious, yet achievable goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction for Emory University. All are in comparison to a baseline of fiscal year 2005 and are based on Emory’s greenhouse gas inventory, experience with resource use reduction in the past decade, and international experience with strategies to reduce emissions. By 2020: 20% reduction in total emissions, 35% reduction per square foot. By 2036 (Emory’s 200th anniversary year): 36% reduction in total emissions, 50% reduction per square foot. By 2050: 50% reduction in total emissions, 85% reduction per square foot.
Some universities have established emissions reduction goals only per square foot of building space, but if campus growth is robust, such an approach will not make any reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions. In recognition of the global urgency to reduce total quantities of emissions in the atmosphere, Emory has adopted goals both or total emissions as well as per 8 square foot. These aggressive goals move us closer our ultimate goal of operating in a carbon neutral manner.

Currently Emory has one of the largest green building inventories by square footage among all universities in the nation.
Emory's green buildings conserve water in the following ways:

    A closed-loop laser system helps the Math and Science Center save 2.8 million gallons of water per year.

    Low-flow fixtures in the Goizueta Business School reduced water use by 20 percent. Cisterns also capture storm water and condensate from air handling units for irrigation.
    Water-saving fixtures at the Winship Cancer Institute Center reduced water use by 24 percent.
    The Whitehead Biomedical Research Building and Emory-Children's Center conserve water and energy at the same time by using large heat wheels to wring the humidity out of the atmosphere, resulting in almost 4 million gallons per year of water being captured and used in Emory's chilled-water system.

Plant Services will work with the Executive Vice President, the Vice President of Finance, and individual departments and vehicle owners to understand current use patterns and maintenance practices, and promote efficient use.

Currently, there is no University-wide policy regarding fleet vehicle use, lifecycle, efficiency requirements, cost, or branding. These factors are managed on a departmental basis without consistency. A consistent and clear policy would include efficiency-related long-term planning decisions around replacement strategies, such as leasing versus purchasing and vehicle types (hybrid, electric, or alternative fuel). A University-wide fleet vehicle policy will require planning, collaboration and approval at multiple levels and across divisions.

Individual departments will continue to fund their respective vehicles and equipment. As vehicles are upgraded, departments will investigate rebate and discount opportunities available for new high- efficiency vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles. For now, fleet usage and vehicle type will also continue to be the responsibility of individual departments.","The future goal for fleet-related emissions is a 3% per year reduction to 2020, or a total of 24%. If achieved, 50.4 metric tons will be reduced by 2020, leaving 159.6 metric tons produced.",Plant Services and Executive Vice President,True,True,"In FY 2009 Gonzaga generated an estimated 943 tons of solid waste. Solid waste sent to the Regional Solid Waste System’s Waste to Energy Plant accounts for about 0.4% of the scope three emissions.
For many years Gonzaga has operated a dedicated waste reduction and recycling program which prevents and diverts waste from the landfill. The program includes three key waste diversion categories: recycling and reuse, composting, and waste prevention. The program received the 2012 Higher Education Recycler of the Year Award from the Washington State Recycling Association.

Recyclable paper, cardboard, glass, metal, and plastic are collected in all campus buildings (over 560 bins). Prior to Spring 2012, Gonzaga University recycled paper, aluminum, plastic and glass in separate bins; since then, collection is commingled. The historic problems of contaminated recyclables (35% of recycle bins suffered from contamination)and of recyclables ending up in waste bins (nearly 56% of waste bins examined contained visible recyclables) have been eliminated, dramatically increasing the recycling diversion rate. Gonzaga supports recycling batteries, electronics, toner cartridges, packing material, and computers (the latter through ITS).
Gonzaga redeploys, sells, donates, trades or recycles almost all of its surplus items. Plant Services collects excess furniture and other surplus items and makes them available to other campus departments through the surplus website. Outdated or damaged items are donated to second hand stores, homeless shelters or offered to Gonzaga employees for sale or for free. The funds earned from the sale of outdated or unusable items on eBay are used to purchase new and second-hand furniture. Electronics that cannot be redeployed, traded or donated are recycled. Gonzaga annually participates in the Soles4Souls shoe drive, which collects new or used shoes during basketball games for subsequent world-wide distribution.

In 2011, Gonzaga’s provider of dining services, Sodexo, purchased a 12 cubic yard receptacle for storing compostable waste. The compostable material is picked up approximately five times a month by a local company Barr-tech (http://www.barr-tech.net). This effort has reduced Sodexo’s trash pick-ups from the COG area by over half, resulting in a cost savings to Gonzaga of over $2000 per month. Compostable waste that has historically gone into garbage cans in the dining facility has instead been separated from trash by Sodexo. In addition, the COG dining facility also went “tray-less” in 2011. Based on comparisons of “Weigh the Waste” nights from before and after the availability of trays, 30% less waste is generated since the implementation of tray-less dining. This program has helped raise student awareness of how much food they throw away. In addition to reducing food waste, going tray-less has resulted in a water savings of approximately 300,000 gallons of water annually and reduced soap purchases by approximately 5%. Since 2012, Sodexo has further supported sustainability efforts by purchasing at least 10% of its food from local farmers.
Sodexo provides ongoing sustainability training and incentives for its employees. In the fall of 2011 Sodexo also began to utilize “Lean Path,” a tool that tracks and records waste from each food production employee and rewards those who improve by reducing waste generation This has helped Sodexo reduce waste by an additional 4% in the 2011-2012 academic year. Their hiring of a Student Manager of Sustainability in 2011 has further increased education and awareness of sustainability throughout our campus food services.
Gonzaga University Plant Services participates in Spokane’s “clean green” program, composting over thirty-five tons of leaves and needles annually. The industrial composting facility, Barr-Tech, can take food waste, clean green, and food contaminated paper and cardboard products, including pizza boxes.
Containers for compostable materials are currently available at the Martin Centre, Madonna, Coughlin, Cataldo, Dooley, Corkery, Chardin, Crimont, and Roncalli buildings. Plant Services has provided Gonzaga students with the opportunity to compost outside of the dining experiences in containers placed behind Cataldo, in Kennedy, in the Sharp-Boone alleyway and near Goller. Plant services also uses these containers to dispose of the yard waste they collect from maintaining campus grounds.
Gonzaga University currently has twelve 96-gallon compost bins, up from one 96-gallon bin in June of 2011. In the 2011-2012 school year 7,200 gallons have been composted and 138 total yards of yield compost generated.Various tactics reduce waste on campus. Reusable mugs are encouraged by offering refill discounts. The Gonzaga Student Body Association (GSBA) proposed a bottled water ban to Sodexo in May of 2008, and that policy was implemented four months later. Since then, first year students are given re-usable water bottles during orientation, and they can fill these bottles in various dining facilities and other sites on campus. In the Spring of 2012 Sodexo added two new water filling stations outside of the COG and Crosby Hall providing water that is double filtered and is sourced from spigots within the buildings through a food-grade hose.
The approximately 3,000 students living on campus generate significant quantities of solid waste at their annual move-out. Since May 2011, a process for collecting reusable items in portable storage containers placed throughout the campus has resulted in significant donations through the Zagiving program created by Residence Life and Catholic Charities of Spokane ( in 2011: 12,000 pounds of material that benefited 435 families).

The University has made great strides at improving its recycling program, especially through the introduction of single-stream recycling. Recycling can be further improved through the following strategies:
 Improved recycling signage.
 Replacing or improving cumbersome classroom recycling bins with low bins that have a hinged
lid.
 Ensuring that a waste bin is located next to every recycling bin.
 Regular study of the effectiveness of recycling system design.
 Increased use of outdoor recycling bins.


Food waste composting is still relatively new to the campus, but it has expanded quickly. Further expanding the composting program will increase the solid waste diversion rate, decreasing related emissions. The composting program can also be improved by strategies such as the following:
 Develop a plan / provide resources to collect compostable materials campus-wide and funnel to centrally-located composters. This will require new well-labeled receptacles throughout campus, emptied regularly to avoid the odors associated with the compostables going septic. A collaborative effort on the part of Student Life, Plant Services, and Sodexo, as well as an effective education program will be required.
 Purchase an additional large composter to be placed behind Cataldo.","Annual waste audit, Calculate waste diversion rate

It involves sustaining the present generation without imposing long-term costs or penalties on future generations. It replaces the use of non-renewable resources with renewable ones and reduces the consumption of all resources. It entails reuse, recovery, and recycling wherever possible; and replenishment or restoration of the natural balances affected by our actions. It implies sound life-cycle planning and economics—economics that truly reflect the environmental and human costs of our technologies and decisions.

What follows is a narrative explaining the nuances of this definition and then the actual technical definition as it is articulated in the Sustainability 2020 Metrics white paper.

Narrative of the definition:

""Our starting point in defining sustainability is the well-known definition of sustainability by the Brundtland Commission: 'meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (WCED, 1987, p. 43). This definition requires us to leave the world better than we found it, or as we put it last year (GMC, 2012):  'To achieve authentic sustainability, we must begin to give more than we take in three areas: Natural Capital, Social/Human Capital and Financial Capital.'  These capital stocks represent the resources humans have available at any given point in time to support a high quality of life within a healthy biosphere.  Sustainability thus requires maintaining or growing these resources over time so that future generations have at least the same capability to thrive that we do. 

This starting definition of sustainability is closely connected with the concept of human well-being, a subject of much research and debate. We have taken a comprehensive approach, incorporating both objective and subjective measures of well-being into our framework. 

Before proposing an initial set of six to eight metrics in each of the capital areas, we attempt to define more carefully the notion of authentic sustainability. The fact that our GMC community does not (and should not) exist in a vacuum complicates the task of assessing our progress. We are embedded in unsustainable systems, which are largely beyond our control. These economic, social, and ecological systems constrain our options and limit our ability to achieve some ideals of sustainability. Our aim is to create a practical model for authentic sustainability which can serve as a guide to other communities and organizations. We believe global, social, and economic systems must undergo a profound paradigm shift. Since we cannot predict the dynamics of this shift, our assessment of Green Mountain’s sustainability will inevitably involve multiple uncertainties. To address such uncertainties requires a pragmatic approach: we can only judge our progress based on those outcomes we can control and understand. In defining authentic sustainability in this way, we can still hold ourselves to an objective criterion — creating more good than harm — while allowing for the possibility that outside events and unknown factors may cause global resource stocks to decline. 

These considerations have helped us arrive at a more formal definition of authentic sustainability, but they also suggest that assessing our progress will, in the end, require judgment.  We propose six guiding principles for our assessment and communication:  
•	Transparency 
•	Resilience 
•	Narrative credibility 
•	Social justice
•	Engaged community
•	Ongoing reassessment and improvement 

We see achieving such an authentic sustainability not as an endpoint, but rather as a significant milestone on a continuing journey.  Ultimately, for us to claim that we have achieved authentic sustainability, we will need to tell a compelling story with integrity.  That story is a critical part of the closed-loop process we propose to assess our progress and guide our actions going forward.""

Technical definition:

""A community C is authentically sustainable during a period t if and only if:
a.   the stocks of natural, social, human, and financial capital within C’s control are increasing over t
b.   continuing the activities of members of C for multiple generations beyond t will likely further maintain or increase each of these stocks, and
c.   during t, C achieves a level of impact on each of these stocks such that if everyone had that impact during t, human society would have the capabilities to thrive for multiple human generations within the carrying capacity of the planet (all else being equal).""


",True,"Sustainability is the primary focus of the institution's strategic plan called Sustainability 2020. The main objective of the strategic plan reads, ""Through innovative education and research, Green Mountain College will achieve authentic sustainability by the end of this decade."" All of the specific goals under this overarching goal are also sustainability-related. The plan is structured around five initiatives: building human and social capital, building natural capital, strengthening financial capital, creating adaptive systems and telling our sustainability story. Many of the goals described in this credit are from the strategic plan. Those that aren't directly from the plan are meant to support main objectives in the plan.

Background: Sustainability in and across the curriculum:

The June 2013 STAC Report defined five programmatic clusters that each present a different perspective on issues of sustainability and climate change: Design/Ethics, Art/Aesthetics; Politics, Ecology & Social Justice; Environment, Education & Communication; Green Urban Solutions; and Food, Farm & Sustainability. Together these illustrate that issues of sustainability and environment intersect with every area of the Hampshire College curriculum. One of the strengths of Hampshire College as a site of innovative curricular development in sustainability and environmental studies is our ability to encourage transformative interdisciplinary thinking around these pressing concerns.  Another strength is the fact that many faculty and students are already teaching and working in these areas. Hampshire College has curricular strengths in sustainable architecture and design, food studies, environmental/science education, and environmental sciences and ecology. In addition, Hampshire College is cultivating relationships with non-academic environmental educators such as the Hitchcock Center. These hold the promise of developing strong curricular and community-engaged learning connections for our students, and situating Hampshire as a center of environmental and sustainability studies.

Proposal: The Creation of an Interdisciplinary Sustainability Studies Program at Hampshire College

Our proposal of an Interdisciplinary Sustainability Studies Program (ISSP) is designed to collect and magnify the diverse efforts, interests, and approaches to sustainability and environmental studies across the campus. The elements of this program include:
a) Curricular and administrative efforts that define and present the five programmatic clusters as pathways through an ISS Program of study.  Students can make ISS the focus of their Division II, or can incorporate an ISS element into a Division II on another topic.
b) Student life efforts that continue to develop and refine the Living Learning Communities associated with sustainability. 
c) Development of non-classroom experiences such as funded internships and research projects that are supported through funding by the Hirschberg Fund.
d) Creation of a faculty position in environmental education or sustainability studies. This will help grow relationships with Hitchcock and other local partners, add to the curriculum in these areas, and further strengthen our offerings in ISS.

Conclusion: these proposals work together to define and support a robust, innovative and radically interdisciplinary approach to sustainability and environmental studies. The Interdisciplinary Sustainability Studies Program defined here would put Hampshire College on the map as an undergraduate institution uniquely poised and able to educate students to be environmentally conscious, aware and active citizens for the future. This program draws together and amplifies our current strengths, makes use of our flexible, hands-on and engaged approach to education, and makes good on our values.

1. Transition Mod (2 units)
Born from the frustration of an unsustainable lifestyle, the Transition Hampshire Mod aims to close the gap between the just future we desire and our everyday reality. The 10 residents (5 in each Mod) will take multiple small changes in their lifestyle while monitoring energy usage, hosting community events, an EPEC class, and advocating for more just choices on campus. Commitments include: sourcing food from all local/seasonal/responsible sources, monitoring and publishing all energy usage, utilizing all non-toxic, natural cleaning methods. We welcome any suggestions about how to make our mod and our lifestyles, more sustainable!

2. Upcycling Mod
The aim of upcycling is to re-purpose something that would otherwise be considered waste & to 'up' its value and quality by doing so. The goal of this community is to create a sustainable space that provides opportunities to design new products, lessen unnecessary waste, teach, learn and generally promote upcycling.

Hampshire College is going to test the limits of regional sustainable agriculture by sourcing nearly 100 percent of food on campus locally, and a $50,000 grant from the Henry P. Kendall Foundation will support the effort.
Hampshire’s 100% Local Food Challenge will draw from the campus farm, and dining service provider Bon Appétit Management Co. already purchases 40 farm shares through the Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. But the College aims to get all food from sources within a 150-mile radius, other than a few items such as coffee and citrus that are not local and fish from within a 500-mile radius.
The Kendall Foundation grant will be used through 2014 to advance this mission, enabling the College to build collaborative networks with local farmers and a variety of community agricultural organizations like the Real Food Challenge, Community Involved in Sustaining Agriculture (CISA), Pioneer Valley Grows, and the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts.
“Thinking about the political, economic, and environmental implications of how we produce, transport, and consume food is a good way to get at broader questions of sustainability,” said Hampshire College President Jonathan Lash. “This transformation will allow us to elevate the current discourse on sustainable food procurement, reduce our carbon footprint, and ultimately empower our students to be informed leaders in considering the food systems of the future.”
Building blocks of the plan have already been developed on campus. Bon Appétit is working with Hampshire to research various opportunities for regional processing and preservation. A range of technologies for expanding the growing season at the College’s Farm Center is also being explored.
One of the key long-term projects in the 100% Local Food Challenge is creation of a Center for New England Food and Agriculture at Hampshire College. Using the College’s land, curricular innovation, and academic and farming expertise, it will be a collaborative hub for members of the agricultural community and for the Five College consortium. Collaborative research programs, sustainable agriculture apprenticeships, internships, and cross-institutional initiatives will provide a much needed opportunity to bring people together to explore the idea of what it means to source 100 percent of food locally.
“We chose to support this initiative at Hampshire because colleges are key levers for change in the food system,” said Kendall Foundation Executive Director Andrew W. Kendall. “They are able to create a meaningful impact on the production and consumption of local food through their purchasing capacity. Longer-term benefits result from the learning and engagement of students, faculty, and the broader community. With the commitment and leadership shown by President Lash and the College's administration, we're thrilled to be able to partner with such an important player in our Route 91 Groundwork area.”
The Kendall Foundation’s Groundwork Strategy focuses on targeted geographic areas within New England that can be lifted up for others who seek to replicate their success. The Route 91 corridor from Greenfield, MA, to New Haven, CT, is one of the selected areas.
The Henry P. Kendall Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to building a healthy food system in New England that increases the production and consumption of local, sustainably produced food.

Kendall Foundation, “Bolstering the 100% Local Food Challenge through Targeted Investment.”  This project will structure and strengthen a local procurement effort that has drawn high levels of attention from both students and alumni. Our strategies to increase our local food consumption include augmenting the participation in meal plans while decreasing protein consumption, and undertaking infrastructure improvements that include physical renovations. We will also work to create a Five College Virtual Food Hub, and link our initiatives with organizational leaders to expand agriculture infrastructure in the region.

",Harvard Office for Sustainability,"The University’s network of campuses is a living, breathing ecosystem set within an urban environment that includes 12 Schools, dozens of administrative and operational groups, a broad range of building types and land uses, and a diverse group of tens of thousands of faculty, students, and staff. From an institutional standpoint, we aim to transform the University into a sustainable community that contributes positive social, economic, and environmental benefits. We are dedicated to institutionalizing best practices in sustainable operations and translating research and teaching into practice by using our campus to pilot innovative solutions that can be widely replicated. We also have a deeper mandate that goes to the heart of Harvard’s research and teaching mission: to educate and empower our students while on campus to become leaders who will use their knowledge to create sustainable impact in service to the world. 

Harvard faculty have helped frame our definition of sustainability in the following way:  

What does sustainable development mean for an institution like Harvard University?

The United Nation’s Brundtland Commission Report of 1987 concluded that humanity has the ability to make development sustainable if it meets “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” 

The Brundtland Report was the catalyst that helped focus humanity on our obligations to future generations as well as to the importance of developing people, not just protecting the environment. However, there is a growing consensus among scholars and leaders around the world that we must now build on the Brundtland Report by incorporating a deeper consideration of human well-being into the evolving approach to sustainable development on local, regional, and global levels.

That consensus argues that when governments, firms, and other organizations consider their possible paths toward sustainable development, they should focus on implications for the well-being of individual people aggregated within and across generations. Well-being depends, of course, on conservation of natural resources and the environment. But there are also other assets from which a society can draw to shape its own wellbeing to pass on to successive generations. A systematic approach to the challenges of sustainable development must appreciate the contributions to our intergenerational well-being of each of these assets, plus the trade-offs and interactions among them:

Natural capital (e.g. biodiversity and capacity to fix energy from the sun)
Manufactured capital (e.g. housing, electrical generating capacity, and transportation)
Human capital (e.g. population size and distribution, personal health, and education)
Social capital (e.g. norms, values, laws, institutions, and trust in them)
Knowledge capital (e.g. public knowledge created through experience, invention, and research).
Organizations, including Harvard University, must ask themselves: “How will these important determinants of well-being be explicitly considered in our sustainable development plans?” and “What steps will we take on our campus to manage this full range of assets so as to benefit human well-being over the long term?” In Harvard’s case, grappling with these questions becomes a device for asking what we want to promote in order to help make our campus, and the communities of which we are part, more sustainable. What are the specific constituents of well-being that most concern us? How are we thinking about them in terms of consequences, not just for us, but also taking into account positive or negative impacts we have on others today and in the future?

Harvard is a thriving academic community that is uniquely positioned to engage in a robust dialogue around these questions and what it truly means to be an organization that supports sustainable development
not only through its research and teaching, but also through its operations. Sustainable development at Harvard involves more than simply reducing our campus’ impact on the surrounding environment. Rather, we must strive to cultivate a robust community that supports the well-being of everyone who passes through our gates, even as we pursue our broader missions of research and teaching.

The creation of Harvard’s first University-wide Sustainability Plan is much more than an exercise in strategic planning. It is an opportunity for every member of our community to reflect on what role they can play in enhancing our collective well-being for a more sustainable future.",True,Sustainability is one of the stated priorities for the President and University.,http://www.green.harvard.edu/plan,--

With focus on how to best prepare students for the future and by leveraging our distinctive resources, deep consideration was given to the array of learning and experiential experiences available at HWS. As such, the curriculum review has led to a revision of the eight goals that all students must meet in order to be eligible to graduate. In the process of establishing curricular adjustments and advancing objectives, there has been focus on how sustainability and related areas can be further interwoven into the HWS education of the 21st century. More specifically, the new curriculum addresses ways in which aspects of the curriculum can bring to light today’s pressing issues, including environmental sustainability, service-learning, and local and global education. This was achieved through amendments to the eighth goal, which now reads,

Goal 8: An intellectual foundation for ethical judgment as a basis for socially responsible action.  An intellectual foundation for ethical judgment as a basis for socially responsible action requires the ability to think and argue rigorously about questions of how things should be.  This foundation ideally incorporates a historically informed examination of one’s values and an understanding of the role of particular circumstances in the context of ethical judgment and action.

We employ integrated pest management (IPM) and best management practices in our turf and landscape installations and maintenance. IPM practices include the treatment of pests (weeds, insects, diseases) only when the damage threshold reaches an unacceptable level. The threshold is set by factors that include: what plant health can tolerate, the aesthetics of the plant and campus, the function and use of the plant or surface (i.e. athletic field, shade from tree), environmental factors, and safety of people and structures. The Colleges employ many cultural control measures, as well as pesticide and fertilization applications. Whenever possible, HWS opts for the cultural practice over the pesticide application, such as core aeration and over seeding a thin turf area instead of grub control and fertilizer where grubs are present, or accepting some leaf damage on a tree infested with Japanese beetles. 

Athletic fields are managed more intensely because of heavier usage. Player safety is also an important consideration in management of athletic fields. Weed growth and grass rooting affects an athlete’s ability to perform as well as foot, ankle and knee safety. Slipping on a weed or shallow rooting of turf grass can injure an athlete or end a career. Proper fertilization and weed control are continually monitored to keep the turf performing at the highest level possible. An IPM approach is employed on athletic fields as well. Because of the intense management, the potential for insect and disease is greater. An important element of IPM is monitoring weather and irrigation. Some pest problems are managed by increasing or decreasing the amount of water the field receives or waiting for the weather to change. Weeds and other pests are generally treated on a “spot treatment” basis as opposed to a broadcast application. Fertilization is performed on a “prescription” type program after a soil test is analyzed annually.

In addition, the Colleges utilize well-designed landscapes to reduce building heating and cooling costs. Carefully positioned trees can save energy a typical building uses. The energy-conserving landscape strategies used are: maximize warming effects of the sun in the winter, maximize shade during the summer, deflect winter winds away from buildings with windbreaks of trees and shrubs on the north and northwest side of buildings and tunnel summer breezes toward buildings.","The Colleges use a number of strategies and systems for the implementation and monitoring of grounds plans, including the use of an integrated pest management (IPM) and best management practices in our turf and landscape installations and maintenance. In addition, HWS also prioritizes native, low maintenance plants and planting strategies to reduce environmental impact. The Colleges also replace trees on a 2:1 basis, return grass clippings when mowing, compost green/leaf waste and reuse, majority of replacement plants are native species, requiring less water and other inputs, irrigate only high use (athletic) turf. The Colleges chip tree debris, mulch grass clippings, compost leaves, and landfill shrub clippings. We estimate that approximately 80% of these materials are mulched or composted. Finished product/soil amendment is reapplied to campus grounds.","HWS Facilities, including the Buildings and Grounds department",--,--,"The Colleges strive to advance sustainability in its Purchasing plans whenever possible, including working with vendors who follow sustainable practices or supply products or services consistent with advancing sustainability.

For example, HWS has been purchasing wind renewable energy credits since 2002 and were the first institute of higher education in New York to use wind power as an alternative energy source. Led by the efforts of the HWS President's Climate Task Force and the HWS commitment to climate neutrality by 2025, the Colleges’ purchase Renewable Energy Certificates equal to 100 percent of the campus' electricity use. The Colleges reached their goal of being powered by 100 percent renewable energy three years ahead of schedule. 

In addition, the Colleges also pursue purchasing practices to advance sustainability in a number of other areas, including supplies and equipment using by Facilities, as well as through Dining Services. All of the Colleges’ equipment and appliance purchases, for example, must be Energy Star rated for superior energy efficiency. “Green” cleaning products, supplies and related items are also used in the day-to-day operations of the Colleges.

In terms of dining on campus, Sodexo has committed to; 100% of our fish and seafood will be sustainably certified by the Marine Stewardship Council or the Best Aquaculture Practices by 2015, Better Tomorrow Plan commitment of 20% local purchase by 2020.

Thus, the FLI and HWS have been developing a set of programs and opportunities to better prepare students for careers in economic development and stewardship of the natural environment. The ultimate goal is to better educate and prepare students for the multiple directions that their baccalaureate degrees may lead them, while making them more aware of their role as citizens and members of a community. 

As stewards of our regional water resources, the FLI faculty and staff also work with HWS offices to implement programs that enhance water sustainability at HWS.",All major renovations and new construction projects incorporate low flow fixtures. All toilets are 1.3 gpf or less and all showers are 1.5 gpm or less,"Facilities, Finger Lakes Institute, Office of Sustainability",--,--,"In 2008, the Colleges made clear plans to advance student diversity and affordability. The most significant changes were made in the HWS Office of Admissions, where all staff members have been given specific responsibilities to advance multicultural student access to HWS. This significant staffing decision has assisted in an increase of multicultural students from 14% in 2008 to more than 20% in 2015 (reaching as high as 25% during that period). During this same time period, HWS has increased its international student population from 1% in 2008 to 7.1% in 2015. Furthermore, HWS committed to an increase financial aid by 30%, which has improved access and affordability to HWS. Currently, more than 80% of enrolled students receive some amount of financial aid. 

Significant initiatives include:

1. In 2012, HWS committed to a four-year $5 million partnership with Posse, one of the most successful college access and youth leadership programs in the country, to help recruit students from Los Angeles and other California cities. The four-year partnership will create access for 40 students that would otherwise face significant challenges to attend HWS. 

2. Since 2008, HWS has partnered with the New Jersey SEEDS (Scholars, Educators, Excellence, Dedication, and Success) program to allow high-achieving rising first year, sophomore, and junior high schools students from low-income backgrounds an opportunity to explore higher education. The goal of the SEEDS program has been to not only prepare promising students for life on a residential campus, but also expose them to the application process through workshops with members of the Office of Admissions and the Salisbury Center for Career Services and Professional Development. 

3. The Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) program has been enhanced by expanding recruitment from New York City to now include downstate New York, upstate New York, and community-based organizations and private schools.  In recent years, the number of students accepted in the HEOP program has increased.

4. HWS has continued to identify and partner with successful community-based organizations in order to recruit high achieving students who might otherwise face challenges attending HWS. These organizations include KIPP, City Squash, Street Squash, SEEDS, and ABC. 

Additionally, the HWS Academic Opportunity Programs, which includes HEOP, are special programs designed to provide broad and varied educational experiences to capable students who, due to academic under-preparation and limited financial resources, might otherwise not have an opportunity to attend college. These programs provide access and academic opportunities by creating a web of support for first generation and traditionally under-represented populations in higher education.

Additionally, in 2016, the Colleges have an opportunity to hire a new leader for the Human Resources Office and one primary responsibility is to provide strategic leadership for campus diversity by developing, implementing and providing programs and policies that support the strategic importance of a broadly inclusive campus community and result in a workplace and learning environment that is welcoming and supportive for all faculty, staff and students.","In order to increase diversity of the Colleges student body, the Colleges are taking steps toward:
• Increasing enrollment for multicultural students to compete with the top level of the HWS comparison group within five years
• Creating geographic diversity among the student body to compete with the top level of the HWS comparison group within five years
• Increasing the number of recruited students through the Posse program
• Continuing to partner with NJ SEEDS (Scholars, Educators, Excellence, Dedication, and Success) and other community-based organizations to identify and assist students.

In order to improve the affordability of an HWS education, the Colleges are taking steps toward:
• Increasing financial aid to incoming students

All of these objectives are in conjunction with an increasing HWS academic profile.","Office of Admissions, Salisbury Center for Career Services and Professional Development",--,--,"All faculty and staff are granted a free membership to the HWS owned and operated Caird Center for Sports and Recreation, an 83,000-square-foot multi-purpose facility. It includes exercise rooms for yoga, pilates, zumba, spin classes, stretching, free weights, weight machines, cardio machines, and other exercise classes. Additionally, there are basketball courts, tennis courts, racquetball courts, squash courts, indoor track, crossfit area, and showers. Faculty and staff are also welcome to swim for free in the Bristol Pool during open swimming times.

The Colleges fully support the Weight Watchers at Work program. Regular Weight Watchers at Work meetings are held on campus and the Colleges contributes 25% of the cost. Employees may also use payroll deduction for the remaining balance.

In addition, faculty, staff and students can take Buddhist meditation sessions led by The Ven. Tenzin Yignyen, instructor of Asian languages and culture. Yignyen is a high-ranking monk within the Dalai Lama's personal monastery.

One of the Colleges' greatest assets is its natural and built environment. Maintaining and improving that environment's accessibility, sustainability and flexibility is critical to HWS 2015. Capital projects, whether for new construction or renovation, must follow HWS sustainability practices, giving appropriate attention to Americans with Disabilities Act requirements and best practices. They must also be energy efficient and funded to ensure appropriate maintenance. Likewise, technology, including pervasive wireless capabilities and one-card access to services and facilities, is essential as students, faculty and staff extend the boundaries of teaching and learning. By eliminating barriers to the physical campus, increasing resources to better provide for nontraditional learning needs, meeting the requirements of the Colleges Climate Action Plan, and building and maintaining the campus with an eye toward flexibility, we can continue to lay a solid capital and technology foundation for future generations of the HWS community. For example, HWS included the construction of a new Gearan Center for the Performing Arts in its most recent strategic plan. The building, which officially opened in January 2016, is expected to achieve a LEED Silver standard. HWS is currently striving for LEED Gold.",http://www.hws.edu/about/hws_2015/recommendations.aspx,The Climate Action Plan goes beyond GHG reduction and elimination and has taken form as a strategic plan for sustainability.

The ISU Strategic Plan includes aspects of sustainability but it is not incorporated in its entirety at a high level.
• make progress in recruiting more minorities and women in executive and professional staff positions, so that the gap in composition of these employee groups and the diversity of our student body is narrowed by 50 percent;
•The following are statements from the ISU Strategic Plan dealing with sustainability. make progress in hiring African American faculty, so that the gap between this group and the percentage of African Americans in our student body is narrowed by 50 percent;
• increase amount of direct and indirect financial support provided by the University to community, social, cultural, and economic development groups;
• increase student participation in outreach activities each year, until, by fall 2014, 100 percent of ISU students have at least one community engagement experience before graduation;
• Energize downtown to create a great college town;
• Develop the neighborhoods around ISU;
• Create a gateway to ISU and a bridge to the Riverscape.

The ISU Master Plan states the following things related to sustainability. Out of eight master tenants of the plan, four of them deal with sustainability. 
4. Maintain and improve the compact campus form building upon the valued pedestrian friendly aspect of the existing environs. ISU has evolved into a cohesive, moderately scaled, pedestrian-oriented campus where buildings and open space form a reasonably tight and pleasing weave of urban fabric. Future improvements should seek to limit the geographic growth of the academic, administration and housing land uses in favor of a pedestrian-oriented compact built form.
5. Improve the campus in a manner that supports the redevelopment of the riverfront in downtown Terre Haute.
7. Improve the campus in a manner that supports the continued development of downtown Terre Haute with the intent of realizing a vital college town atmosphere. A successful and urbane mixed use central business district will enhance the perceptions of the ISU campus. The new uses should include additional housing, offices and retail. 
8. Improve the campus in a manner that responds to contemporary and practical sustainable design practices. ISU embraces an increasingly sustainable existence. This may impact nearly every aspect of operations and may include intense scrutiny on energy consumption, but may also reflect the importance of water resources, fauna and flora, air quality and more. Projecting a progressive posture on these issues will enhance ISU. As society becomes increasingly sensitive to sustainability, institutions
of higher learning are expected to provide a leadership role to lead the general populace in these matters. It has become common for universities to expend effort to project an environmentally friendly image.

The following provides some more detail about the thoughts in the ISU Master Plan.
As society becomes increasingly sensitive to sustainability, institutions of higher learning are expected to provide a leadership role to lead the general populace in these matters. It has become common for universities to expend effort to project an environmentally friendly image. ISU has already started this process as evidenced by the recycling center amongst other successes. Extending this momentum to a discussion about the landscape leads to conversations about the naturalized landscapes that require less embodied energy and are more completely capable of supporting native fauna. Developing a more sustainable landscape is one of the most visible ways to impact an institution’s image. This master plan seeks to start a few important changes:
• A reduction in the use of cultivated lawns. The intent would be to lean toward limiting the use of cultivated lawns to areas where people will use a lawn (Frisbee throwing, etc.)
• With the reduction of cultivated lawns comes the opportunity to substitute plant materials that are more capable of thriving without irrigation.
• Greater reliance upon native plant materials. Native fauna has evolved with a reliance upon a native plant food source. Displacing native plants with exotic species reduces the stability of the native fauna and is considered a contributor to the reduction in biodiversity.

Lighting
ISU has recently selected new campus lighting standards that will be used throughout campus.
The standards should be evaluated as it relates to sustainable design issues such as dark sky and
migratory bird impacts and the evolving LED lamp technology. The LED lamps offer large energy
savings and the public is more aware of the impact of unrestrained light.

Rankin Hall Plaza Renovation
The plaza west of Rankin Hall is in need of major renovation. The plaza serves as a roof over the
campus computing center and the roof is a permanent leak threat with potential for significant
water intrusion. ISU installed a green roof at this location in 2013. 

riverSCAPE
The City of Terre Haute and County of Vigo have been engaged in riverfront redevelopment planning
activities. The intent is to create mixed use/park areas on the east bank of the Wabash. The
efforts include large tracts of underutilized land and will require decades to realize. The proposed
improvements include the area west of the ISU campus.

Wabashiki Fish and Wildlife Area (Wetland)
A wetland reserve is being planned for large areas of the Wabash River flood plain including areas
immediately west of the ISU campus. This will provide high-quality natural areas for ISU students,
faculty and staff to enjoy and utilize for teaching purposes.

Terre Haute Central Business District Planning
The City of Terre Haute has been working with Downtown Terre Haute, Inc. in an effort to realize
a more vital central business district. The groups are interested in preserving the historic fabric,
while employing good urban design practices to achieve a more active and pedestrian friendly
core.

Alternative Transportation
A number of public agencies within Vigo County have been involved with the planning and
construction of an alternative transportation system. Included within the system is the:
• National Road Heritage Trail
• riverSCAPE
• Future bike lanes to the Wabashiki Fish and Wildlife Area (Wetland)

Landscape Character
The character of the ISU landscape has continuously evolved since its inception, largely responding to the influences of fashion trends and building programs. In many instances, the planting design reinforces the structure of the campus improvements through the ordered placement of trees consistent with the layout of the adjacent architecture and hardscape, both of which typically respond to the former urban grid. Many of the informal green spaces break from the geometric patterns and offer a more casual respite.
The planted understory is typically loosely defined, often times a mix of woody and perennial plant material, and used to direct pedestrian traffic patterns. More often than not, the ground plane is an irrigated lawn. The plant materials are a mix of exotic and native species and a mix of evergreen and deciduous.
As society trends further toward sustainable design practices, the use of exotic species and unrestrained cultivated lawns will be more challenging to continue. There are numerous reasons why ISU will feel the need to alter planting design practices including:
Water resources • will become more highly valued and will likely cause many midwestern institutions to use more efficient irrigation systems and to limit irrigation to premium green spaces.
• Cultivated lawns require the application of problematic chemicals in order to acquire and retain the desired lush green appearance.
• Cultivated lawns require frequent mowing resulting in the consumption of fossil fuels.
• Native species offer a much more complete food source for the native fauna, helping to increase bio-diversity.
• The use of native plant associations is an easy way for institutions to project an environmentally progressive image.
• The use of native and adapted plant associations can result in lower maintenance costs.
It should be noted that native plant associations, particularly the alternatives to cultivated lawns, result in a different aesthetic for the landscape. Some individuals may find the alternative look less attractive though acceptance often results from an awareness of the environmental benefits.

Campus Density & capacity
The ISU students, faculty, staff and visitors are able to enjoy and benefit from a compact campus form. The moderate density of the existing environment facilitates convenient pedestrian and bicyclist commutes across the entire breadth of the main campus and the central business district. In addition to the sustainable forms of transportation, the current density levels foster the development of a vibrant and character filled physical environment in which buildings shape outdoor green respites.

Alternative Transportation & Mass Transit
Indiana State University has developed components of an alternative transportation system and has been involved with building momentum in the greater Terre Haute community for such facilities. Bike lanes have been established along the north edge of campus linking the campus to a planned rail-trail project serving the east side of Terre Haute.

The recently provided bike lanes link to a bike trail located on 4th Street. The bike lanes effectively link the campus to the near south side of Terre Haute and to the University Apartments. Planned additions to the trail system offer the opportunity to link to the planned riverfront parks on the east and west banks of the Wabash adjacent to downtown Terre Haute.

Terre Haute’s new multi-modal facility transportation is located on the ISU campus at the corner of 7th Street and US 40 (Cherry Street, National Road). Bus service is available at the multi-modal facility and a shuttle serving the ISU campus operates out of the facility.

Rainwater Management
The recent evolution of the Clean Water Act and trends in sustainable design have led to substantial changes in the way large institutions, like ISU, are managing rain water. No longer are we seeking to discharge rain water as quickly as possible. Good practices in the early 21st century include efforts to minimize runoff and to cleanse the rain water before we do discharge it to our neighbors downstream. ISU has been utilizing infiltration basins the past couple of decades for the purpose of returning rain water to the aquifer, an environmentally sound practice that has effectively taken large tracts of land off the City’s combined sewer system as well as saved meaningful amounts of money for ISU. This practice should continue to be used.

The northern limits of the campus lie within a wellfield protection district. Special care will need to be taken when working in these areas as direct discharges of polluted rain water into the aquifer cannot be allowed to happen. In many cases, the answer may be as simple as pushing the rain water through a vegetated area with a deep bed of pervious soil. Functioning much like a septic system, the soil microbes will consume the pollutants.

",True,True,"Kent State University is renowned as a center of excellence in wellness, attracting and engaging faculty, staff and students.  Wellness is defined holistically, encompassing mind, body and spirit; it is reflected in healthy behavior such as exercise, eating wisely, preventive care, and adequate rest. Wellness is embedded in the KSU culture, in work systems that value and empower employees, and in the built and natural environments.
A wellness plan has been created that is a set of proposed recommendations and suggested action steps, organized by themes, goals, and objectives.
These recommendations are organized under broad proposed goals arranged according to the seven wellness themes:
•	Fitness: Provide opportunities and support for faculty and staff to engage in physical activity that is appropriate and adequate to individual needs.                        
•	Food: KSU faculty, staff and students will have access to quick, healthy meals, meeting USDA guidelines, within a five minute walk on campus.  
•	Health Management: KSU will shift from tertiary/critical catastrophic care to primary/preventative care.
•	Personal Well-Being: Provide programs that support personal development, health and well-being.                                  
•	Social Well-Being: Create a culture and community of social collaboration around wellness activities.             
•	Quality of Work Life: Create a work environment where 75 percent of faculty and staff are satisfied with their quality of work life.     
•	Built and Natural Environments: Optimize the built environment to facilitate physical activity, emotional well-being, and social interaction.
While the themes are distinct, both administratively and conceptually, they are tightly interconnected. The success of the proposed plan in delivering a vital culture of wellness depends crucially on an integrated approach to implementation.  Each specific recommendation has been assigned a projected year of implementation.  In the first year, recommendations center around developing an infrastructure and detailed plans that would assist in achieving the proposed goals, objectives and recommendations. One major focus of this ongoing effort is the development of a meaningful system of metrics to prioritize initiatives, assess outcomes and identify opportunities for improvement. 
","The University’s strategic plan has charged the division to “support and promote the health and well-being of the university community through implementation of a strategic and comprehensive health and wellness approach.”  The following are the broad based excerpts from a detailed plan document that reflects the proposed goals and outcomes linked with specific recommendations, strategies and activities to be implemented over a five-year period.

In the plant selection stage, a survey of the landscape and grounds on the university is completed. From this information, the planning stage can take place and landscapers can select the types of plants that are native to the area around the campus. Once these plants have been selected, they are placed in the areas around campus which will best suit the environment and their development. This practice continues as new landscapes become available and as more native plants become the most optimal choice.

Campus Planning ",True,True,"Ensure that our student body is diverse, embraces the mission of the university, and possesses the academic potential and personal attributes necessary to participate fully in our rigorous academic experience.
  A diverse student body is integral to LMU’s core value of fostering an inclusive community. At LMU, diversity refers to individual differences (e.g, personality, learning styles, and life experiences), and group or social differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, and ability as well as cultural, political, religious, or other affiliations) (AAC&U). Diversity generates important educational benefits because it provides a setting for students to live among and learn from those who are different from themselves. This is particularly important in a global, multicultural society and world.  In addition, a transformative education requires that students are prepared to engage in rigorous academic experiences, desire personal development beyond intellectual growth and career preparation, and seek to become men and women for others.

In addition to being a cleaner source of fuel, the woody material is a renewable resource from campus landscape. As much as 8,000 to 9,000 tons of wood chips are used as biofuel annually. Learn more about how MSU generates power.

Stormwater management - Several landscaping solutions are used to manage stormwater runoff to naturally cleanse the water and to reduce the risk of flooding.
Trees: a valuable asset

Trees are one of the most valuable natural energy-savers on campus. Shading reduces cooling costs. They act as windbreaks, which reduces heating costs. Trees also reduce heat islands that occur over hard surfaces in urban environments. Since trees are such a valuable resource, MSU takes special means to protect trees in construction areas and tailgate zones. In some instances, trees have been relocated to accommodate for a new building while preserving the tree. A technique called air spading allows the entire root system to be exposed without damage, the correct planting depth and root flare to be identified and the tree to continue to flourish after transplant.

Preventing “cowpaths,” protecting trees - Certain areas of the MSU campus are marked with infamous “cowpaths” of pedestrians that choose to take a shorter walk across green space than stick to installed sidewalks. Sidewalk placement follows these natural walking trails when possible. However, in areas with extensive tree root systems that weave underground, concrete cannot be used or the roots would be suffocated. As an alternate solution, rubber sidewalk was installed. The implementation was successful.

Academic mission - In the greenhouse near Bailey Hall, chefs that work for Residential and Hospitality Services grow herbs that are then used directly in campus cooking, reducing the costs and fuel use of transportation and packaging. Students intern within the greenhouse and work with the chef as part of their academic programs.","- Water conservation measurements and tracking of water use per operation

",Office of the Provost,--,--,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,--,--,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"The most common and basic definition of sustainability was established by the 1987 report of the United Nations Commission of Environment and Development, ""Our Common Future"" which defined ""sustainable development"" (sustainability) as ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."" Embedded in that definition are two important elements: 1) a long-term view (generations) and 2) a systemic of ecological sense of life. We also accept a definition of sustainability that means ""meeting human needs in a socially just manner without depriving ecosystems of their health"" (Vucetich & Nelson, 2010).  In this way, sustainability also touches our sense of ethic, ethos, and culture and reflects our ideal at the highest level; more than simply efficient planning. Thus, sustainability is about the interdependence of living organisms and communities (both human and nonhuman) over the long haul. Instead of seeing environmental, social, and economic needs as a collection of discrete characteristics or problems, sustainability at MSU looks at them as interdependent and connected. Each has an impact on and consequences for the others.

As an institutional framework for our sustainability vision (definition), a commitment to this definition as it relates to our core missions, goals, and growth as an institution: Michigan State University will foster sustainability by aiming to provide for all of its stakeholders needs in socially just ways both in present and throughout time. We will attend to human well being by better understanding our role within a coupled human-natural system; bolster the ability of complex systems to adapt to changing circumstances for the good of all beings; include and encourage the voices of all stakeholders; and respect the value of preserving choices and a world as rich in resources and possibilities for future decision-makers as we have now.

• Maintain competitive compensation to attract and retain an outstanding staff
• Expand professional development and educational opportunities for staff
• Increase staff diversity

From the Strategic Plan:
Recommendation #25: Promote greater work-life balance.

As programs at Middlebury evolve, greater demands are sometimes placed on faculty and staff members who are deeply committed to the welfare of students—academically, physically, and emotionally. This dedication can lead to over-extension, stress, and diminished morale. A healthy balance between employees' professional and personal commitments, ""work-life balance,"" will contribute to job satisfaction and good performance, improved relationships, and a sense of community. We recommend that the College explore ways to enhance work-life balance and to recognize ever-evolving life roles and responsibilities.",Dean of Faculty and Dean of the College,True,True,"The Campus Master Plan (2008 recommends that the College makes every effort to invest in environmentally friendly, socially responsible areas. 

The President announced in August 2013 that the College is preparing to take three actions:

-The Investment Committee of the board, including its student members, will work to develop a set of stronger ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) principles that we can apply to our investment portfolio, both to identify those companies and managers who invest with certain principles in mind and those who consistently do not. As part of this effort, we will intensify our ongoing review of the College’s investment portfolio.
-We will create ESG guidelines to help monitor investments and operations at our own campus in Vermont. We will issue periodic reports on our performance.
-We will increase significantly the amount of the endowment directed toward ESG investments, including those focused on clean energy, green building projects, and other efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the environment.  
","The Campus Master Plan (2008) makes the following recommendation regarding the investment plans:
College Finances
1. 	Make every effort to invest in environmentally friendly, socially responsible areas
","Vice President for Finance & Treasurer, Board of Trustees, Office of Sustainability Integration",--,--,,,,"The Campus Master Plan uses Chief economist of the World Bank Herman E. Daly's three operational rules to define the the condition of sustainability:
1.  Renewable resources such as fish, soil, and groundwater must be used no faster than the rate at which they regenerate.
2.  Nonrenewable resources such  as  minerals and  fossil fuels must be used no faster than renewable substitutes for them can be put into place.
3.  Pollution and wastes must be emitted no faster than natural systems can absorb them, recycle them, or render them harmless.
",True,"Ten campus planning goals were developed with the Master Planning Committee in a series of workshop. The first goal directly addresses sustainability:
Goal #1
Promote Sustainability in all College Operations
This goal is intended to build on Middlebury’s long-standing commitment to sustainability, and to make it more comprehensive and measurable so as to assure continuous improvements.

Sustainability is also a main system of the plan: 
Middlebury College has been an environmental leader for over forty years. The sustainability part of the Master Plan aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current environmental status of the campus and suggest levels of improvement and measuring. The College does extremely well in some categories, for example fuel source and waste management, but major improvements need to be achieved in building energy use, in transportation, and in monitoring and measuring.

Strategic Imperative 3: Strengthening our commitment to inclusion, social justice, and sustainability

Mills students are motivated by a commitment to an inclusive community, social justice, and a sustainable planet. Yet, data from the National Study for Student Engagement show that Mills students report fewer opportunities to participate in efforts toward such goals than they anticipated, creating concerns about retaining students who may not see the relevance of Mills to important life goals. Diversity, social justice, and sustainability are an underlying concern of all our strategic imperatives. While listed here separately, this underlying commitment has implications for re-examining the curriculum, internationalizing Mills, creating a vibrant campus, and developing partnerships.

Providing opportunities for students to connect Mills’ experiences to interests in diversity, social justice, and sustainability. In thinking about this imperative, Mills can be a “living laboratory” to define and redefine social justice, build community, engage with communities beyond campus, and live in sustainable, climate-neutral ways. Mills is a campus full of intellectual and physical resources for our own learning about social justice and sustainability and for the larger Oakland community as well. Learning in this “laboratory” is not only extracurricular but also connected to the curriculum. The campus farm provides one possible means of building a “living laboratory” across the curriculum and co-curriculum. Programs in the Division of Student Life as well as the Living Learning Communities provide many other means.

Mills hosts a number of resources and individual initiatives on campus that can connect us to community and social justice concerns. There is an ongoing need to have some coordination of resources and initiatives for community engagement and connection to the curriculum. A point person, working in the Provost’s Office and partnering with Career Services, to connect the curriculum with service learning, along with study abroad, paid and unpaid internships, and community partnerships, could provide such coordination.

Developing scholarships. The high cost of a private liberal arts college is another obstacle to students’ engagement in social justice and the community. Tying scholarship money to students’ work on issues of social justice, civic engagement, and sustainability could attract and retain students and donors. This might include “service” scholarships for new first year, transfer, and graduate students engaged in social justice and the community.

Creating an environment inclusive of all diversity. Creating a just, equitable, and inclusive environment for all students, while paying attention to diversity along many lines of identity including, for example, race, class, sexual orientation, ability, spirituality and religious diversity is ongoing work. As a women’s college, Mills has a long tradition of challenging, in particular, gender stereotypes, inequality, and injustice. That tradition, which stretches from preparing women for the professions and civic life to providing opportunities for women to excel in areas of the curriculum and co-curriculum that were seen as more appropriate to men, has broken normative conceptions of gender. In the 21st century, the challenge to gender norms comes from students who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming. To stay in the vanguard of gender justice and equity and to build and retain an overall diverse student body, Mills needs to consider how it serves the transgender and gender nonconforming students already here and those considering a woman’s college. These considerations include examining policies ranging from admissions and athletics to curriculum and housing. Towards that end, the College will continue the dialogue begun by the recommendations of the Diversity and Social Justice Committee in its report on Inclusion of Transgender and Gender Fluid Students.

Focusing on sustainability across campus. Mills has been committed to sustainability for years. However, learning to live it in every aspect of our working lives remains a challenge. While Mills can be a learning laboratory of sustainability, helping students learn through curricular and co-curricular work about social justice and equality in the world around them, it is imperative that the Mills community live and model the value we hold dear. Mills will pursue initiatives which enable us to be viewed as a 21st century college committed to sustainability with efforts including developing a campus farm, adopting energy savings measures, promoting food justice and participating in the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment to lessen our environmental footprint.","-Planning and implementation of a Urban Farm at Mills College.

approved in spring 2015. Beginning in spring 2016, up to 25 NC State
undergraduate students will be resident students at CMAST, NC State’s
Center for Marine Sciences and Technology. This maiden voyage of the
program is the first of a standing series of full semesters allowing exposure
to all facets of marine science.
Tactic: Develop new courses that feature content related to sustainability
issues.
Progress: A new Environmental Sciences course (ES 150) called Water
and the Environment received initial approval and could be offered to
students as early as the spring 2016 semester.

Strategy 2: Explore the concepts underlying sustainability in
courses and curricula to build the case for sustainable practices.
Tactic: Create an inventory of sustainability and sustainability-related
courses based on the Sustainability Tracking, Reporting, Assessment
and Rating System (STARS) definitions to understand what courses are
already offered. Submit the course list with NC State’s STARS submission
in fall 2015.
Progress: Students from the EcoVillage completed the course inventory
as a capstone project in collaboration with the directors of the University
Sustainability Office and the EcoVillage. After receiving training on
STARS definitions and the inventory template, students searched the
university course catalog using more than 160 keywords. Staff reviewed
and edited the list for quality control.

Strategy 3: Engage in discussions for advancing sustainability
to optimize the use of energy, water, buildings, land, transportation
and existing space through participation in the Campus Environmental
Sustainability Team (CEST) working groups.
Tactic: Pilot an energy saving program during the summer when classrooms
are not in heavy use.

unoccupied and building temperatures were adjusted to optimize energy
savings. Planning for summer 2015 included consolidating events and
classes into designated buildings for additional savings.

Strategy 4: Use the physical campus as a classroom and
research facility to demonstrate and explore sustainability principles
and practices.
Tactic: Continue to position PackLink as the resource for students to
connect with sustainability-related projects on campus and gain realworld
experience through experiential education.
Progress: PackLink upgraded to a better online platform allowing
easier viewing of project opportunities. Encouraging campus departments
to include projects is an ongoing effort.

Strategy 5: Promote research to advance sustainability,
including discovery of new technologies that advance sustainability,
securing patents and employing new workers that align

Tactic: Create a sustainability research inventory based on the
Sustainability Tracking, Reporting, Assessment and Rating System
(STARS) guidance to identify faculty involved in sustainability research.
Submit the course list with NC State’s STARS submission in fall
2015.
Progress: The full research inventory will be completed during summer
2015. To aid that process a few new resources are available online
at sustainability.ncsu.edu including a list of faculty in the Sustainability
Cities Consortium as well as faculty looking for student help in their sustainability
research. These resources will be added to the full research
inventory and submitted with NC State’s full STARS report.

Strategy 6: Engage faculty researchers in sustainable practices
to increase the resource use efficiency of research equipment and
spaces needed to conduct state-of-the-art research.
Tactic: See strategy 5 tactic
Progress: See strategy 5 update

Strategy 7: Provide opportunities for service learning that bridge
education, research and the practical application of sustainability.
Tactic: Create a mechanism for faculty to learn about how to include
sustainability in their teaching, research and/or practice.
Progress: The Office of Faculty Development and the University Sustainability
Office partnered to offer two short Sustainability in Teaching
workshops during the year. Expanding on those workshops, there will
be an all-day workshop over fall break 2015 about “Where Interaction
Meets Impact: Integrating Sustainability Into Teaching, Research and
Practice,” to replicate a model that has been successful on other campuses.

GOAL ONE: Shape Your Life

Promoting student success through personal responsibility in a supportive environment
Students learn and achieve more when they are challenged to take personal responsibility for their
own educational and life journey. Consistent with best-practice models of human development, DASA’s
role is to help students map their own learning experiences, by 1) increasing awareness of their own
potential, 2) increasing awareness and access to all of the academic and developmental opportunities
available to them, 3) supporting them throughout their entire experience at NC State University and
4) holding ourselves and every student accountable to fulfill our full potential. Innovative educational
experiences, such as interdisciplinary studies, service learning, study abroad, problem-based curricula,
work-based learning and entrepreneurship, challenge and inspire students to fully engage in meaningful
self-exploration in pursuit of personal achievement.

Strategy 1.1: Establish a process for students to develop Personal Strategic Plans that assists them in
identifying opportunities to participate in activities that enhance their health and
wellness, high-impact practices, student organizations, co-curricular activities and
opportunities to expand their exposure to US and global diversity and culture. (2013-

The Green NAU Energy Initiative (GNEI) trains faculty and staff Energy Mentors so those mentors can take what they've learned about conservation back to their respective offices and engage their co-workers in sustainable practices. GNEI also holds RA competitions where RA's create conservation themed hallway designs aimed to engage students living in residence halls in conservation efforts.

Residence Life trains ""EcoReps"" so there are individuals in residence halls throughout campus that educate their peers about EE and conservation. The EcoReps also organize and participate in events such as tabling and the Eco-Fashion Show.

The Environmental Caucus holds monthly meetings open to all of campus to educated attendees about sustainable research, initiatives, and events happening around campus and in the greater community. The EC also funds a communications intern who works to update their Green Calendar and promote sustainable  initiatives and events around campus.

The Green Jacks are the student environmental group that hold regular meetings and work to engage students in on- and off-campus sustainable initiatives. They are integral to the organization, promotion, and running of NAU's Earth Week - which has a heavy focus on campus engagement.

The Green Fund's mission is to promote student participation in and provides funding for projects that reduce NAU’s negative impact on the environment and create a culture of sustainability on-campus.

The main obstacle for advancing sustainability in Air and Climate at Pomona College is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to be Carbon Neutral by 2030.

In response to this goal, Pomona College plans to
take action on climate change with the following prioritization of efforts:
- Conservation (behavior modification and elimination of use)
- Renewables (purchase and development of alternative energy sources)
- Offsets (third-party or off-campus offsetting of emissions).

The College does not plan to purchase offsets. While the purchase of these offsets would likely be necessary to eventually “neutralize” all sources of carbon emissions, the College is committed to prioritizing behavior modification, conservation, efficiency, and renewable sources as methods of emissions reduction.

Institutionalize support for Faculty Fellows including resources for faculty stipends and training","Executive Vice President, Provost, Student Development","The term “sustainability” represents many different perspectives, and is often defined in different ways. The exploration of sustainability at Seattle University is guided by three points of view:
1. Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
2. Development that “replaces the use of nonrenewable resources with renewable ones and reduces the consumption of all resources. It entails reuse, recovery, and recycling wherever possible; and replenishment or restoration of the natural balances affected by our actions. Sustainable development will succeed only if it expands to include a vision of sustainable communities which hold all creation as sacred.”
3. A decision making framework that treats the economy, environment, and society as a tightly interconnected system. Attention is focused on all three areas simultaneously to maintain balance and ensure decisions lead to positive economic, environmental, and societal impacts.",--,,http://www.seattleu.edu/uploadedFiles/Sustainability/Content/Related_Content/Seattle%20University's%20Climate%20Action%20Plan%202010-2035%20v1.2.pdf,--

Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable practice requires finding balance between economic, social and environmental priorities.

Sheridan College commits to the ongoing pursuit of alignment with these four sustainability Principles from the Natural Step:

In a sustainable society, nature is not subject to systematically increasing concentrations of substances extracted from the earth’s crust. This means substituting our use of certain minerals that are scarce in nature with others that are more abundant, using all mined materials efficiently, and systematically reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.

In a sustainable society, nature is not subject to systematically increasing concentrations of substances produced by society. This means systematically substituting certain persistent and unnatural compounds with ones that are normally abundant or break down more easily in nature, and using all substances produced by society efficiently.

In a sustainable society, nature is not subject to systematically increasing degradation by physical means. This means drawing resources only from well-managed eco-systems, systematically pursuing the most productive and efficient use of resources and land, and exercising caution in all kinds of modifications of nature, such as overharvesting and the introduction of invasive species.

In a sustainable society, people are not subject to conditions that systematically undermine their capacity to meet their needs. This means offering products and services and changing practices, suppliers, and business models to those who demonstrate, through their policies and practices that human rights are respected, income-making barriers are removed, safe and healthy work environments are provided, and living conditions allow local communities to meet the needs of citizens.",True,"The Strategic Plan mentions the waste reduction goal.

Currently SCSU students in GEO 305: Applied Sustainability are drafting a resiliency campus risk assessment, which they will submit to the SCSU Sustainability Committee for review in April 2016.

SCSU offered a spring 2014 Womens Studies conference titled ""Spirituality, Ecology, Sustainability""

In 2014, SCSU  helped establish CLASU, the CT League for the Advancement of Sustainable Universities. Organized by United Illuminating, SCSU, and the University of New Haven, this effort is part of UI's Business Sustainability Challenge to engage municipalities, businesses, industry, and campuses to collaborate and unify sustainability efforts. The Office of Sustainability has identified this forum as an important capacity building opportunity to extend efforts more effectively off campus, to communicate more clearly with other CT campuses, and to identify efforts that can be scaled efficiently and effectively together. In 2015, SCSU piloted the Energize CT Higher Education Fellowship through CLASU, to offer student recipients an opportunity to collaborate with United Illuminating and a local energy consulting firm to update our Climate Action Plan.



In year 2 of the Food Recovery Network, student interns will manage collection of food to donate, and coordinate with ""Community Plates"", a non-profit focusing on distributing donated foods. This will allow interns more time to promote the program and increase scale. In late spring and summer 2016, food recovery interns will explore venues to disseminate information about establishing food recovery programs for interested community groups.

SCSU will increase the percentage of produce we grow in the community garden to donate area soup kitchens. We harvested approximately 200 lbs of produce and donated it to area soup kitchens in the 2015 growing season.

SCSU installed a sign at the Community Garden to better inform the community of its location and existence.","To measure growth in scale of our programs, we weigh foods donated to soup kitchens to track totals (starting summer '14 and annually)

As part of the Facilities Master Plan, SCSU will continue to prioritize energy efficiency and green building as described in other sections of this survey to reduce carbon and other emissions associated with energy use.

Scheduled roof replacements include consideration of cool roof or reflective surfaces to reduce urban heat island effect, as well as low VOC emitting materials. SCSU completed its first roof renovation in summer 2015, using low-VOC emitting material.  Utility rebates and cost influence this type of decision. In the case of the low-VOC roof, it is slightly more expensive  up front, but since the material sets harder, is projected to lengthen the life of the roof.
In October, 2015, President Mary Papazian signed the Climate Leadership Commitment on behalf of the university community and with the approval of the cabinet. The pledge commits SCSU to planning campus resiliency and adaptation as part of a wider community. SCSU is in early stages of conducting an initial  campus climate risk assessment, by students in GEO 305: Applied Sustainability, under the direction of Dr. Elyse Zavar. Dr. Zavar and her students will present their findings to the Sustainability Committee in April, 2016.

Vehicle Fleet Emissions Reduction Strategies
1. Minimize climate impact of fleet vehicles through the use of fuel-efficient vehicles or vehicles which utilize alternative technologies and fuels. As fleet vehicles are replaced, purchase vehicles which get better gas mileage or utilize alternative technologies or fuels to reduce carbon emissions.
Proposed Actions:
 Replace existing fleet vehicles with vehicles that get better mileage, or with hybrid or electric vehicles.
2. Reduce miles traveled by the vehicle fleet. The most efficient way to reduce emissions produced by fleet vehicles is to reduce the miles traveled by those vehicles. Reducing miles traveled by fleet vehicles also reduces costs for fuel.
Proposed Actions:
 Reduce or eliminate unnecessary trips.
 Utilize “runners” to pick up materials and equipment from vendors for Facilities operations.
 Create separate Facilities shops on upper and lower campuses to reduce driving back and forth to FMP.
 Discourage employees from returning to FMP for breaks.

Air Travel Emissions Reduction Strategies
1. Encourage alternative transportation modes. Other modes of transportation compare well to flying in terms of speed and convenience but have a lower carbon impact.
Proposed Actions:
 Incentivize carpooling.
2. Restrict reimbursements for air travel. A restriction on travel may be necessary to reduce emissions from air travel.
Proposed Actions:
 Eliminate or reduce reimbursements for flights less than 150 miles from the point of origin.
3. Encourage alternatives to travel.
While in-person attendance at distant meetings is required in some cases, technologies such as teleconferencing offer opportunities to reduce air travel emissions. Travel time can be reduced while still allowing desired levels of interaction.
Proposed Actions:
 Expand teleconferencing opportunities to the entire campus community. 

Commuting Emissions Reduction Strategies
1. Encourage alternative modes of transportation/commuting to reduce the number of vehicle miles driven. The most effective method for reducing emissions from commuting is to reduce the number of vehicle miles driven to and from by students, faculty and staff in single occupant vehicles.
Proposed Actions:
 Make free bus passes available to students, faculty and staff; and encourage the use of public transportation for commuting to campus.
 Work with the Rogue Valley Transportation District to expand their bus routes and schedules to meet the transportation needs of students, faculty and staff.
 Raise campus parking permit rates to encourage use of public transportation.
 Encourage students, faculty and staff to ride a bike or walk to campus, when feasible.
 Provide changing rooms with showers and covered/indoor bike parking opportunities for bicycle commuters.
2. Minimize climate impact of commuting. When the use of alternative modes of ground transportation is not feasible,
minimize the impact of commuting to campus by car.
Proposed Actions:
 Implement an “Eco Driving Program” to teach campus motorists how to drive in a more energy-efficient manner.
 Offer reduced cost or free carpool parking for student, faculty and staff.
 Expand the Ride-Share Program in the Commuting Resource Center.
 Collaborate with Ashland Ride Share to utilize their hybrid vehicles to augment Motor Pool vans.
 Offer reduced cost parking permits for hybrid vehicles and scooters.
 Provide charging stations for electric vehicles; encourage use of bio-fuel vehicles.

The Provost's Committee states in its Sustainability 3.0 strategic plan that one of its objectives is to develop sustainability in undergraduate curriculum, including introductory courses and instruction packages for external use. This initiative also seeks to develop a sustainability Masters program and certificate program.","Stanford currently offers 487 sustainability courses and courses that include sustainability, but the Provost's Committee hopes to increase that number further. In fact, the Sustainability 3.0 strategic plan states many measurable objectives for advancing sustainability in curriculum at Stanford. The first objective is developing a Sustainability 101 online class for incoming students. The next objective is implementing interdisciplinary problem-solving courses on sustainability issues, from introductory ""thinking matters"" courses, which are taken by all freshman, to freshman seminars, to ""helix"" sets that are linked and coordinated across the university. These types of courses will require faculty buy-in, so Sustainability 3.0 outlines the creation of incentives for faculty participation in these courses as another objective for advancing sustainability in curriculum. Lastly, Stanford plans to enact ""sustainability challenges and impacts"" classes that explicitly link education and problem solving within the university as well as with partners outside. In addition to these objectives regarding new courses, Stanford also plans to enhance older curricula and programs to increase impact. For example, in the 2014-15 academic year, Stanford reinvigorated its Green Fund by including staff- and faculty-sponsored projects that were focused on sustainability that students could implement. In addition to the money students received through the Green Fund to implement these projects, students were eligible for research units as part of the incentive. Lastly, planning for a sustainability co-term Master's program was underway throughout 2015. The core curriculum for this Masters program includes systems thinking, leadership, and a course at Stanford's d.school. ","The Provost's Committee partners on these initiatives with the Vice President of Undergraduate Education, the Haas Center for Public Service, the School of Earth Sciences, the Woods Institute for the Environment, and the Precourt Institute for Energy, in addition to other faculty members and school deans. ",True,True,"The Sustainability 3.0 Strategic Plan includes an outlined goal to expand Stanford's solution-oriented research activities and link them firmly with decision making in the university and beyond. This action seeks to advance the positive outcomes of the Initiative on Environment and Sustainability, which helped produce such entities as the Woods Institute for the Environment and the Precourt Institute for Energy after its launch in October 2003.","Sustainability 3.0 lays out several objectives for its expansion of sustainability-focused and practical research activities. First, Stanford seeks to identify and fill gaps in faculty expertise, especially across the social sciences. Next, Stanford plans to analyze the successes and shortcomings across Stanford's research endeavors in an effort to link research with decision-making. Lastly, Stanford will engage the graduate community by creating strong connections between Stanford operations and academics in an effort to identify graduate research opportunities and incentivize graduate research contributions to campus-wide and global sustainability solutions. In addition to the above tactics, Stanford will implement new programs in the field of research to accomplish its objectives. For instance, the university will develop and carry out scholarly analysis of current and past Stanford research focused on interdisciplinary problem solving for sustainability goals, identifying what works and why in an effort to link knowledge to action. The university will also publish and share this experience locally to improve ongoing efforts. Lastly, Stanford will enhance its ""Uncommon Dialogues"" which bring together leaders from government, NGOs, and businesses with Stanford experts to develop practical solutions to pressing environmental challenges. The expansion of this program will create an ongoing dialogue among researchers and decision makers for sustainability and will help secure additional funding for faculty and students to engage in problem solving research in concert with decision makers.",This initiative is spearheaded by the Woods Institute for the Environment and the Precourt Institute for Energy.,True,True,"The Sustainability 3.0 Strategic Plan outlines a goal of engaging the broader Stanford campus through outreach campaigns, training programs, and incentives. The outcomes of this goal will build upon existing programs, such as Stanford's Cardinal Green Buildings campaign, Stanford's annual participation in the nationwide Recyclemania campaign, and other building level programs that have been executed by the Office of Sustainability since its inception in 2007.","The Provost Committee's primary objective for accomplishing this goal is to enhance the mechanisms through which employees and students can engage in existing sustainability campaigns and programs. As part of this endeavor, Stanford enhanced its Cardinal Green brand in the 2013-2014 academic year by tying together all of its sustainability programs and campaigns under the Cardinal Green brand. Next, Stanford's Office of Sustainability began development of an interactive web portal that was launched in fall 2014 that allows Stanford community members to access information specific to their individual and/or building-level participation in sustainability programs. Within these profiles, faculty, staff and students all have the opportunity to find out how to get involved, participate in Sustainable Stanford's season campaigns, and receive incentives for participating in sustainability on campus through an online  action network, which will launch as a pilot in 2016. 

In early 2016, the Office of Sustainability also launched school- and department-level sustainability report cards accompanied by action plans encouraging participation in sustainability campaigns and programs. These report cards reflect each building's performance in energy, water, waste, purchasing, transportation, and occupant engagement. These report cards have already facilitated increased awareness among entire schools and departments and should result in increased staff, faculty, and student participation in sustainability initiatives.","The Office of Sustainability is primarily responsible for the execution of Stanford's sustainability campaigns and programs, with significant input from the Sustainability Working Group and direction and oversight from the Provost's Committee on Sustainability. The dorm-level report cards will be implemented by Stanford's Residential and Dining Enterprises Student Housing division.",True,True,"Stanford's Haas Center for Public Service places a lot of emphasis on community-engaged learning, especially in the area of sustainability. Through the new Cardinal Service initiative, the Haas Center has formalized their plans for student and alumni participation in public engagement and provided clear avenues for Public Engagement centered around sustainability.

","In fall 2015, Stanford launched the Cardinal Service initiative, which includes 4 primary components: Cardinal Quarter, Cardinal Commitment, Cardinal Courses, and Cardinal Careers. The Cardinal Quarter component is meant to help students design a full-time summer or quarter-long public service experience with Stanford support. Many of the available placements are in public service positions that focus on sustainability. Then, Cardinal Courses helps students enroll in courses that apply classroom knowledge to address real-world societal problems, including sustainability challenges. The Cardinal Commitment component then asks students to make and sustain a significant service commitment tied to their Stanford experience. Finally, Cardinal Careers allows students to explore career opportunities in the public service and sustainability sectors and emphasizes the ability to integrate service into any career. The Office of Sustainability has worked closely with the Haas Center for Public Service to make sure sustainability offerings are integrated into each component of the new Cardinal Service initiative.

Additionally, Stanford is rapidly expanding its community engaged learning (e.g., service-learning) program in sustainability with the addition of a Director of Community Engaged Learning in Environmental Sustainability in 2014. This Director is consulting with faculty to expand the course offerings to students that allow them to engage with an off-campus community in the realm of environmental sustainability. One goal of community-engaged learning is to increase student civic engagement with crucial public issues, like global change. Another goal is to facilitate the interaction between faculty, students, and the public around projects and ideas that are related to long-term (local and global) sustainability.

",The Haas Center for Public Service is responsible for advancing sustainability in the area of public engagement. ,True,True,"Stanford’s long-range Energy and Climate Plan provides a vision for the campus’ energy future that dramatically reduces GHG emissions. Incorporating engineering and financial models, the plan demonstrates long-term cost effectiveness and sustainable natural resource use; guides development of critical campus infrastructure; and reduces economic and regulatory risks to Stanford’s long-term energy supply. The plan takes a takes a three-pronged approach to climate solutions, balancing investments in energy efficiency in new buildings, energy reduction in existing infrastructure, and a cutting-edge energy supply system known as Stanford Energy System Innovations (SESI). SESI represents a transformation of university energy supply from a 100% fossil-fuel-based combined heat and power (CHP) plant to a grid-powered energy facility with heat recovery and a robust renewable energy portfolio. Through SESI, Stanford will reduce its potable water consumption by 15% and GHG emissions by 68% from 2013 levels by 2017.  The Energy and Climate Plan has thus put Stanford on a path to outperform all state, national, and global greenhouse gas reduction targets, making the university a leader in confronting climate change. The plan is updated with every major milestone, most recently in August 2015. The plan can be found online at: http://sustainable.stanford.edu/resources.","The Energy & Climate Plan was designed with the vision of applying Stanford’s intellectual and financial resources to provide leadership in climate change solutions through a long-term, holistic, and flexible approach. The first step in its development was a comprehensive analysis of current campus energy use and GHG emissions. Stanford has been accounting for and publicly reporting its Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions since 2006. In 2014, emissions totaled close to 179,000 metric tons CO2 equivalent. Using this data, campus growth projections were then used to create a GHG emissions forecast that informed the development of the Energy and Climate Plan. Given Stanford’s planned growth to support its academic mission, its large and diverse existing campus building inventory, and its historical reliance on natural gas cogeneration for energy (the main source of past GHG emissions), the Energy and Climate Plan provides a balance among investments in new buildings, existing buildings, and energy supply.

HIGH-PERFORMANCE NEW BUILDING DESIGN
Given the university’s significant growth plans, constructing high-performance new buildings to minimize the impacts of growth on campus energy systems and GHG emissions is a key strategy. The Guidelines for Sustainable Buildings, originally published in 2002 and updated in 2008, in combination with the Guidelines for Life Cycle Cost Analysis and the Project Delivery Process Manual, provide the framework for minimizing energy demand in new construction and major renovation projects on campus. Programs in place to maximize energy efficiency include:
•	Optimization of current space through Stanford’s Space Planning Guidelines. Before undertaking any building project, Stanford first conducts a rigorous space utilization study to see if renovation of existing buildings can create space for new needs.
•	Mandatory efficiency standards for new buildings, which must use less energy than the benchmark energy and water use of peer buildings .
•	Guidelines for sustainable buildings that address site design; energy use; water management; materials, resources, and waste; and indoor environmental quality.

 ENERGY CONSERVATION IN EXISTING BUILDINGS
Since the 1980s, Stanford has employed building-level energy metering of all its facilities to understand how and where energy is used in order to facilitate strong energy efficiency programs. Reducing energy use in existing buildings is crucial to creating a sustainable campus. The university has substantial programs to improve campus energy efficiency, including:
•	The Energy Retrofit Program, which improves building energy efficiency and has led to cumulative annual energy savings of 300 billion BTU since 1993.
•	The Whole Building Retrofit Program, which targets the campus’ most inefficient buildings for retrofits. Fourteen projects have been completed as of spring 2015, and 8 more are underway. The program has already achieved $4 million in annual energy savings.
•	The Energy Conservation Incentive Program, which targets reductions in energy use through human behavior, rather than technology.
•	 Plug Load Energy Reduction programs, which reduce the energy consumption of the biggest “energy hogs” of equipment identified by Stanford’s campus-wide plug load inventory. These include IT equipment, lab equipment, and space heaters.

STANFORD ENERGY SYSTEM INNOVATIONS (SESI)
Since 1987, Stanford relied on a natural gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant for virtually all its energy demand. Although efficient, its fossil-fuel based source caused the CHP to produce 90% of Stanford’s GHG emissions and consume 25% of the campus’ potable water supply. As a result, Stanford’s GHG reduction strategy focused primarily on transforming the university’s energy supply through a new Central Energy Facility (CEF).
The new CEF includes three large water tanks for thermal energy storage and a high voltage substation that receives electricity from the grid. A key feature of the CEF is an innovative heat recovery system that takes advantage of Stanford’s overlap in heating and cooling needs. In addition to the CEF, the SESI project converted the heat supply of all buildings from steam to hot water. This new system is 70% more efficient than the CHP plant. The efficiencies gained from the new CEF and hot water conversion, along with Stanford’s commitment to procure much of its electricity from solar, will reduce the university’s overall GHG emissions by 68%. 

The plan can be found online at: http://sustainable.stanford.edu/resources.
","Stanford's Department of Sustainability and Energy Management (SEM) along with management from the Land, Buildings, and Real Estate division that houses SEM, are primarily responsible for the execution of SESI and the long-term Energy and Climate Plan.","Stanford is continually guided by its original master plan designer—Frederick Law Olmsted, the visionary founder of American landscape architecture—and directed by Stanford’s Guidelines for Sustainable Buildings, which originally stated that new buildings must use 30% less energy on average than current energy code requirements. In 2015, Stanford began revising these guidelines to become more performance-based, requiring that each new building's energy performance improve upon that of existing buildings on campus of the same type.

Olmsted envisioned a resource-conserving campus that would respond to its climate and context to achieve beauty and functionality. The guidelines, which all new building projects are expected to follow, update that vision for today’s context. Ensuring that new buildings are as efficient as possible is essential to reducing campus greenhouse gas emissions, which is why Stanford has followed these strict guidelines since 2002, with revisions in 2008. Energy generation for heating, cooling and electricity in buildings accounts for 85 percent of Stanford’s carbon dioxide emissions—and from 2000 to 2025, we expect to build 2 million square feet of new academic facilities and new housing for 2,400 more students, faculty and staff. Through the ongoing advancement of programs such as the Cardinal Green Office Program, the Energy Retrofit Program (ERP), and the Whole Building Energy Retrofit Program (WBERP), Stanford has developed strategic plans to reduce the energy consumption of its buildings significantly.",True,True,"The Cardinal Green Office Program offers building occupants an opportunity to become leaders in sustainability by implementing sustainable practices in their office spaces. This program has continued to develop since its creation in 2009, reaching broader audiences and leading to increased energy savings. Since its inception, the Cardinal Green Office Program has served over 80 buildings by providing energy audits, recommendations, and rebates for energy-saving devices like smart power strips and programmable timers. The Office of Sustainability also released school-level sustainability report cards in early 2016 that help schools and departments better understand their sustainability performance in the areas of energy, water, waste, transportation, purchasing, and occupant engagement in sustainability programs. Each report card is also accompanied by an action plan that encourages participation in existing sustainability programs on campus and helps each school and department make individual plans for improving sustainability performance within their building portfolio.

Additionally, one of the university's key goals is to recover 5–10 percent of the space in existing campus buildings. Studies conducted to date have found that many offices could recover up to 10 percent of their space. To encourage more efficient use of office space, Stanford requires selected schools to pay a charge for underutilized space. Several schools are working to reduce their space charge through efforts such as conducting master space plan studies and renovating spaces in conformance with the Space Planning Guidelines. 

Lastly, the Facilities Energy Management team within SEM operates the WBERP and ERP programs. WBERP was allocated $30 million for major capital improvements to the most energy-intensive buildings on campus. The first overhaul, of the Stauffer Chemistry Building, was finished in June 2007 and resulted in a 35 percent drop in electricity use, a 43 percent cut in steam use and a 62 percent fall in chilled water use. It also reduced carbon dioxide emissions associated with the building by 762 metric tons per year and cut energy costs by 46 percent in the first 12 months. As of August 2014, the university had completed 14 WBERP projects, which are saving annually 9.5 million kWh, 5 million ton-hrs of chilled water, and 71 million pounds of steam, representing over 14,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and savings nearly $4 million per year. An additional 12 projects are in the pipeline, which are projected to save another $2.3 million per year.This program operates in conjunction with ERP, which provides rebates for lighting retrofits, energy efficiency devices for office equipment, and efficient lab equipment, among others. Together with the Cardinal Green Office Program, one goal of ERP for the future is to increase adoption of the ERP rebates across campus.

The Office of Sustainability and the Procurement Department worked closely with Office Depot in 2015 to apply Office Depot's proprietary ""shades of green"" analytics to Stanford's entire office supply spend through Office Depot to identify opportunities for improvement and compile an action plan for improving sustainable office supply purchasing across campus in the future.","The first measurable objective in Stanford's sustainable office supply purchasing plan is including a focus on sustainable purchasing in the existing Recyclemania waste reduction campaign. This campaign will focus specifically on purchasing paper with recycled content and recycled toner cartridges, since those were the two primary opportunities identified through Office Depot's analysis of Stanford's office supply spend. Recommendations related to paper purchasing and toner purchasing will also be included in the campus-wide sustainability action network, through which users will qualify for incentives by completing these personalized recommendations. A pilot of this action network will launch in 2016. Purchasing was also included in the school level sustainability report cards (using data from Office Depot) that were released in early 2016 in order to raise awareness around the purchasing habits of each school and department and provide recommendation for improving those practices.

Stanford’s Parking & Transportation Services is assessing various aspects of campus growth in its continued commitment to support the academic mission of the university. With projected job growth and commute trends in Silicon Valley pointing to increased traffic congestion, Stanford has developed and launched a Regional Transportation Planning Initiative under the leadership of Land, Buildings & Real Estate. Many new and exciting TDM programs have been developed as a result of this initiative, which includes a framework for long-term growth.","Within the context of long-term transportation planning, Stanford is expanding its relationships with the region’s public transit providers. This is being pursued to improve service coming to campus as well as help advocate for long-term funding and system improvements. This proactive approach will help encourage greater use of public transit by the university’s commuting population while enhancing the availability of public transit service for the entire Bay Area. As an example of how the university is pursuing this objective, Stanford recently became a founding member of the Caltrain Commuter Coalition, which is working to stabilize operating funds for Caltrain and build support for Caltrain’s electrification program.

In addition, the existing electric vehicle (EV) policy is undergoing a review as a result of the long-term transportation plan. This review includes assessing the number and location of charging stations to be installed in the future and determining charging-level options. In keeping with the university’s addition of new photovoltaic solar arrays on campus to increase renewable and efficient energy supplies through the Stanford Energy System Innovations program, one goal of the long-term transportation plan is to expand the number of EV charging stations on campus and to transition more of the university’s free Marguerite shuttle fleet to 100-percent electric buses.

The university is also working on a long-range waste plan. ","Stanford has several measurable objectives for waste reduction in the coming years. Stanford bases its strategic waste plans off of the waste audits off of the 28 waste audits that have been performed. For example, Stanford identified that 17% of the material being sent to the landfill was paper, so the university established a uniform desk-side recycling program to be deployed across campus. After a pilot project in operations buildings, this program was fully launched in summer 2014. As of February 2016, over 7,500 sets of bins (each set includes one paper recycling bin and one mini trash can) have been deployed in a total of 82 buildings on campus. 

Secondly, Stanford continues its endeavors to make sure all recycling and composting bins are labeled uniformly. Stanford has re-labeled over half the bins on campus and will steadily continue to re-label the remaining bins. These labels clearly show what types of products should be put in which bins, and their consistency across campus will translate to higher levels of recognition among individuals and, in turn, improved individual recycling habits. 

Additionally, Stanford has recently expanded its composting program, since waste audits have shown that organic waste comprises 31% of material sent to the landfill. For instance, Student Housing has expanded its paper towel composting program and has formal plans to make some of their residences Zero Waste. This program was rolled out in 2015 and began with several of the high-profile row houses. Also in 2015, Stanford launched an interior composting program for the first time, where Stanford's waste management contractor will set up and service compost bins inside academic buildings at a minor cost to each department. As of February 2016, 50 buildings are participating in this program, and the waste composted through this program increased from 1,140 pounds in July 2015 to 2,560 pounds in November 2015. The university also operates a voluntary composting program and continues to strategically add shared compost dumpsters across campus to make it easier for building occupants to discard organic waste from the small compost bins that they individually maintain. 
",PSSI is the entity responsible for waste collection on Stanford's campus. PSSI works closely with Buildings and Grounds Maintenance (BGM) and partners with the Department of Sustainability and Energy Management (SEM) on many of its sustainability endeavors.,True,True,"Stanford's award-winning water conservation program has reduced potable water use by 40% since its inception in 2000—despite continued campus growth—through commitment, dedication, innovation and implementation of a comprehensive set of water saving measures informed by the Water Conservation, Reuse and Recycling Master Plan, which was developed in 2003. ","The Water Conservation, Reuse and Recycling Master Plan was developed in 2003 based on a comprehensive study of Stanford’s water use trends. It considers domestic water from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Stanford’s Lake Water System, and reclaimed water availability, and it considers both existing water conservation programs at the time and projected water use trends both campus-wide and by department to determine appropriate future water conservation, reuse, and recycling measures. The master plan lays out a total of 14 feasible water efficiency measures, many of which have been implemented to date. For instance, ultra-low flush toilet replacement, showerhead retrofits and urinal replacement were the top three recommendations, all of which have been implemented by Stanford and have contributed to the 26% decrease in potable water consumption since 2000. Additional steps in the master plan include Faculty/Staff Housing Water Audits and converting the football practice fields to lake (non-potable) water irrigation, a measure that is currently being considered.

Additionally, Stanford has been conducting studies of the effects of Searsville Dam and Reservoir, and in March 2014 Stanford unveiled a new Resource Recovery Center that will study the potential of wastewater to produce both clean water and energy. These studies will continue to be analyzed to provide valuable insight into the future of Stanford's water programs. 

Finally, the new Stanford Energy System Innovations (SESI) energy project, which came online in Spring 2015, will further reduce campus potable water use by another 15%, bringing Stanford's total water consumption down nearly 40% since its 2000 baseline.

By facilitating a culture of wellness at Stanford, the program encourages individuals, departments and families to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors. The program is continually expanding its offerings to faculty, staff, and students to not only encourage adoption of its health and well-being programs, but also to directly incorporate sustainability into its offerings. Stanford also operates the Health Improvement Program, which provides fitness classes and other wellness activities to the Stanford community. As a leading wellness initiative in higher education and a valued program among staff and faculty, both the BeWell and HIP programs are guided by formal plans and strategies to ensure they reach their goals.","As BeWell continues to be a leading university wellness program, it is consistently adapting its practices and strategies to allow for continuous improvement. BeWell offers many activities that count as ""berries."" After the accumulation of 6 berries, employees receive an added financial incentive. One of BeWell's strategies for improvement is to continually reevaluate its berry options to give employees credit for new healthy behaviors and allow them to focus on the healthy lifestyle choices that most interest them. For instance, in 2013-2014, employees' 9 favorite berries remained unchanged, while 11 more options were added for increased program flexibility. During this time, berries were added specifically in the 'Commit to Community"" category, where there are options such as ""Environmental Class"" and ""Environmental Self-Report."" Additonally, the BeWell staff collect surveys after each class or activity to evaluate the effectiveness of that option and make improvements in future years. 

BeWell also continually reevaluates the structure of its overarching program to meet its objectives. A recent development in this area in the 2014-15 academic year was an added ""Engagement"" section of the BeWell program platform. This engagement requirement includes coaching, action, and reflection, and is now a mandatory component of each individual plan in order for individuals to receive their BeWell incentives.","The BeWell program staff work through Stanford University Human Resources and in partnership with the Health Improvement Program, which is operated out of the School of Medicine. ",True,True,"The Board of Trustees’ Special Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) is advised by the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility (APIRL), which continually works to address “substantial social injuries” by adopting social issue policies and proxy voting guidelines and engaging corporations. Methods include: holding written, verbal, and/or in person dialogues as necessary; notifying corporate boards and management of intent to disinvest or, if all other methods of engagement have failed to influence changes in business practices, use of divestment (such as the recent decision to divest from coal companies on May 6, 2014). ","The university—operating through the APIRL and the SCIR—has developed certain Investment Responsibility Core Social Issue Policy Statements and Proxy Voting Guidelines which cover and address many current issues, including Environmental Sustainability. Where it has decided upon such a guideline, the University’s Statement on Investment Responsibility directs that the University will “normally vote according to existing University Investment Responsibility Proxy Voting Guidelines.” For example, in May 2014, acting on a recommendation of Stanford's APIR-L, the Board of Trustees announced that Stanford will not make direct investments in coal mining companies. The Board of Trustees concurred with the advisory panel that divesting from coal is consistent with the university's Statement on Investment Responsibility given the current availability of alternatives to coal that have less harmful environmental impacts. The resolution means that Stanford will not directly invest in approximately 100 publicly traded companies for which coal extraction is the primary business, and will divest of any current direct holdings in such companies. Stanford also will recommend to its external investment managers, who invest in wide ranges of securities on behalf of the university, that they avoid investments in these public companies as well. A student-led organization known as Fossil Free Stanford petitioned the university last year to divest from 200 fossil-fuel extraction companies as part of a national divestment campaign. The request by Fossil Free Stanford was reviewed over the last several months by APIRL's Environmental Sustainability Subcommittee, which met with the group, conducted its own extensive research and took input from other constituencies. The subcommittee's recommendation was subsequently approved by the full APIRL, the Trustees' Special Committee on Investment Responsibility and the Board of Trustees. 

In the investment context, in addition to the action on coal, Stanford's existing proxy voting guidelines adopted earlier by the Board of Trustees mandate that the university vote ""yes"" on proxy resolutions asking companies to adopt sustainability principles, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the energy efficiency of their operations.

As part of the sustainable investment strategic plan, Stanford hired a Director of Investment Responsibility Stakeholder Relations in 2015 to enhance the university's ability to manage and engage with the campus community on issues of investment responsibility.

In 2003, an interdisciplinary Environmental Geochemical Science major was added, followed in 2006 by an Environmental Studies minor. Given the level of interest in environmental issues among students, it is expected that increased enrollments will create the impetus for greater allocation or reallocation of resources for these programs, such as more dedicated faculty and increased operating budgets.  In 2010-11, 48 courses focused specifically on the environment including science courses such as Ecology and Natural Resources and Energy and social science courses such as Gender and the Environment and the Politics of Environment and Development. In addition, many courses in some way incorporate environmental themes. For example, in recent years some English and art classes have used the environment and sustainability as themes for creative expression. In the School of Business, several classes incorporate environmentally related issues such as environmental accounting and business ethics as they relate to sustainability.

intersection of environmental and water quality, biodiversity, the food chain and public health concerns; (e) providing best practices solutions for aging urban infrastructure; and (f) contribute to short, middle and long-term solutions through innovations in technology, policy, and management for urban environmental systems. 
","Strategies for advancing sustainability research include the creation of an 
interdisciplinary Center for Urban Ecology. This proposed Center will connect 
faculty research activities in an integrative manner through interdisciplinary efforts drawing from departments and colleges to create a university-wide sustainability research enterprise. The proposed Center will involve faculty and graduate fellows to conduct sustainability research related to the urban ecology theme, sponsor visiting scientists, host seminar and workshop events, and build interdisciplinary research teams related to the emphasis areas outlined above. In addition to the proposed center, the university is also supporting student research efforts through the CARAS research program and has started a graduate resource award program.

Temple’s transportation-related emissions represent 21% or approximately 45,000 tons of the university’s FY 2008 greenhouse gas emissions. Commuting is a significant emissions source: approximately one million miles are driven by single-occupant Temple commuters on a weekly basis, including Philadelphia and Ambler campuses. According to a university survey conducted in December 2007, an estimated 40% of all students, faculty and staff commuters drive alone. On the other hand, 41% of Temple’s commuters do not use a car at any point in their commute, instead taking public transit, bicycling or walking. 
 
The recommendations developed by the Transportation Committee were based on an understanding of the three principal ways in which GHG emissions can be reduced in the transportation sector: 
 
1) Reduce motorized travel associated with the university’s mission, including student, staff and faculty commuting, operations of the university’s vehicle fleet, and travel to off-campus sites for university business and academic meetings and conferences. 
2) Increase the efficiency of motorized travel by reducing single-occupancy vehicle travel, increasing shared travel and non-motorized travel, and encouraging the purchase of higher fuel-efficiency vehicles. 
3) Reduce the carbon intensity of fuels for motorized travel by encouraging the purchase by commuters and university vehicle fleet managers of vehicles that operate on compressed natural gas, biodiesel, electric batteries and other lower-carbon content sources of energy. 
 ","Project Title Priority Parking and Lower Parking Rates 
Project Description: Priority parking and lower rates would be given to low-GHG 
emission vehicles (those with combined city-highway fuel economy ratings of 35 miles per gallon or higher) and motorcycles. Discounts would be based upon revenue-neutral 
pricing, which raises parking fees for non-fuel-efficient vehicles a small amount in order to fund deep discounts for the comparatively smaller number of high-fuel-efficiency vehicles used by Temple commuters. To implement such a program would require an awareness campaign to inform commuters of  Climate Action Plan, the incentives, redrawing of the parking garage layout to create more priority parking spots, and additional signage. Similar discounts could be applied to vehicles used for carpooling.

","Office of Sustainability, Bursar's Office and Parking Services. ",True,True,"In May 2010, Temple University adopted its Climate Action Plan, which delineated the university’s interim goals for reducing its carbon footprint and infusing sustainability into the campus culture. The Climate Action Plan addressed the role of waste minimization and recycling as part of its comprehensive efforts to reduce the university’s carbon footprint. Since the adoption of the plan, Temple has achieved a 10% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions derived from solid waste. While this is a noteworthy success, the university’s recycling rate continues to remain at 30%, with only 20.3% of core materials being recycled. Core materials include mixed paper, cardboard and aluminum, glass and plastic beverage containers. 
 
This report was prepared in response to the Climate Action Plan, which recommended the creation of a Waste Minimization and Recycling Committee that is tasked with identifying strategies for achieving tangible reductions in waste and increasing Temple’s recycling rate to 40% by 2015. This report lays out the committee’s findings and recommendations. 
 
This report reviews the goals established in the Climate Action Plan, provides an overview of Temple’s existing waste minimization and recycling practices, and examines the successes and challenges of the current program. The report then sets forth a series of recommendations aimed at increasing the university’s recycling rate while minimizing its waste stream. 
 
This report identifies ten action areas to be considered when developing a comprehensive recycling and waste minimization program. The areas include: 
 
1. Education, Training and Outreach. Temple University has an extensive recycling program and an array of waste minimization initiatives. However, many students, staff and faculty are still unclear on the materials that can be recycled on campus or what they can do to reduce waste. This section outlines educational programming, training and outreach aimed at increasing recycling rates among the Temple community and minimizing the waste generated. 

2. Labeling and Containers. This section reviews the types of containers utilized on campus, their multi-material sorting methods and the consistency in the labeling of recycling receptacles on campus. 
3. Outdoor Recycling Facilities. The outdoor recycling program has a strong infrastructure on campus. This section explores opportunities to further strengthen the program, including reviewing the consistency and distribution of the outdoor recycling containers on campus. 
4. Expansion of Plastic Recycling. This section looks at the breadth of the university’s plastic recycling policy and ways to build on synergies with and successes of the City of Philadelphia’s recycling program. 
5. Institutionalized Reuse and Recycling of Surplus Inventory. Temple University generates a large amount of surplus inventory due to its size and its need to be on the cutting edge as a research facility. This section investigates new opportunities for recycling and waste diversion of surplus inventory, such as clinical and laboratory materials, major appliances, furniture, research equipment, and electronics.
6. Waste Minimization and Recycling at Special Events. University departments host a variety of special events throughout the year. This section looks at ways to increase recycling and minimize waste associated with these events. 
7. Purchasing. This section explores opportunities for the university to minimize its waste and increase its recycling rate through its purchasing policies, procedures and practices. 
8. Housing and Residential Life. Temple’s residential community is comprised of approximately 5,200 students and is expected to grow in the future. This section suggests ways to increase the recycling rate in the residence halls and promote waste minimization. Areas addressed include outreach and education, containers and facilities, moving and composting. 
9. Food Waste and Dining Facilities. Each year, Temple diverts 165.60 tons of food waste from entering the waste stream. This section highlights opportunities to increase the amount of food waste diverted and to minimize the amount of dining related waste generated through infrastructure changes, recovery programs and education and outreach. 
10. Harnessing Technological Advancements. Technological improvements and increased availability present new methods for students, staff and faculty to reduce the amount of waste they produce. This section looks at the promotion of existing technologies as a tool for reducing waste levels. 
 
The report sets forth recommendations for each of the above identified action areas. The recommendations can be implemented in four phases: immediately (completion by the end of calendar year 2011), short-term (completion by June 2012), mid-term (completion by June 2015), and long-term (completion by June 2020). The implementation of the recommendations will require university departments to forge new partnerships and institute institutional procedural change. Additionally, while the goal of the report is to develop programs and practices that are revenue neutral, there will be some upfront costs to implement the recommendations. 
","The Climate Action Plan established a goal of reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions derived from land-filled solid waste by 10% by 2015 relative to the 2006 baseline level. The Climate Action Plan estimates that Temple emitted 5,229 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2E) in 2006. A 10% decrease is equivalent to 529 MTCO2E. The university successfully achieved that reduction in 2008. In fact, between 2006 and 2010, Temple reduced its emissions associated with solid waste by 19%. 
 
Although it reached its 10% greenhouse gas emissions reduction benchmark, the Climate Action Plan identified additional waste minimization and recycling recommendations, which are listed below: 
 
• Increase the recycling rate from 32% to 40% by 2015; 
• Increase outdoor recycling opportunities to ensure that every trash can is accompanied by a recycling can; 
• Explore composting of food waste; 
• Review opportunities in the food service areas to replace disposable dinnerware and eating utensils in all dining halls; 
• Review business practices that contribute to excess waste; and, 
• Engage students in residence halls to reduce waste. 
 
It should be noted that the Climate Action Plan did not identify a specific target for the reduction of trash. A goal and benchmark system for waste reduction may be something that the Waste Minimization and Recycling Committee considers as a way to evaluate the success of the university’s efforts. 
 
This report will explore opportunities on campus to increase its recycling rate to 40% while minimizing waste generated by operations and individual community members.

As described in its Strategic Plan, the Center for Public Service aims to:
I.	Promote and maintain the highest level of quality in our partnerships and projects.  Our objectives emphasize the significant relationship between faculty and community partners as co-educators, highlighting the importance of public service in addressing community challenges.  We will enhance the critical reflection process by empowering students as facilitators and promoting creative reflection techniques.  Our community partners will deepen their interaction with CPS and Tulane through more targeted partnerships and opportunities.  And overall, CPS will create a comprehensive monitoring and assessment plan to ensure that our programs offer the greatest benefit to all of our constituents, and will give us the data to make adjustments and targeted trainings where needed.

II.	Implement innovative and intentional strategies to address community challenges. Tulane’s engaged faculty and students are positively impacting the Greater New Orleans community with a plethora of projects across the city and world.  CPS can capture the potential of this work to target a prevalent social challenge, whether it be a specific neighborhood or a pressing issue.  Using a thoughtful, participatory strategy and analyzing Tulane and community resources, CPS will work with its constituents to determine a target area.  Our constituents will be engaged together in interdisciplinary approaches to target the same social challenge, and students will gain the experience of thinking through innovative strategies as a team.  These objectives further support Tulane’s highlighted themes of social innovation and placed-based learning

III.	Engage our constituents in dialogue and understanding around diversity and inclusion as experienced through community encounters. New Orleans is a unique setting that draws students from all over the country to attend Tulane, yet many students are not fully prepared for the many cultural and social differences they’ll encounter off-campus.  A more in-depth orientation to community issues and tools on how to engage differences are needed to supplement the on-site service orientations that already take place.  In line with Tulane’s Diversity and Inclusive Excellence initiative, CPS is creating the Community Engagement Advocates program to train students, faculty, and partners as facilitators to use dialogue and other programing as tools towards building greater understanding and empathy for differences encountered in the community.  Program objectives include:     

IV.	Continue to exercise a leadership role on campus and in the field of community engagement. CPS staff will focus on improving its effectiveness and impact both inside and out.  For greater efficiency and effectiveness, staff will streamline internal procedures so as to maximize their ability to achieve program objectives.  CPS will advance our research and publications, increasing opportunities for more constituents’ to become involved, so as to further our mission on campus as well as the field of community engagement.  

V.	Promote a change in campus toward full engagement of faculty, staff, students, and community partners in public service. Since 2006, Tulane has seen an increase in engaged students, staff, faculty, and research, yet some do not understand CPS’s role in engagement and the support we can offer.  CPS seeks to better clarify and market its role as a resource on community-engagement for the Tulane and wider community.  CPS will make itself more accessible and create greater awareness of its programs through more strategic marketing and through strengthening collaborations with other Tulane centers and departments.  With faculty being at the crux of all of CPS’s academic programming, increasing our support, resources, and reward for faculty-engaged scholarship is essential to the quality of our academic programs.  Likewise, strengthening our communication with students and student organizations will allow pathways for student leadership and achievement, and further support student-initiated projects.  To further keep community engagement on the forefront of campus life, CPS will highlight community partners as a valued voice and resource on campus.

In June 2015, 2014 Tulane University Climate Action Plan was completed and adopted.  The plan identifies the most impactful and cost-effective measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that result from university activities.  In the near-term, the university will work to capture immediately available and important efficiency gains in campus energy supply and distribution, advance building energy demand management, introduce renewable energy sources, and increase efficiency within the campus fleet and air travel.  New construction will be designed to achieve a high level of energy efficiency.  In the mid-term, the university will continue to implement energy conservation measures, and will introduce an ambitious transportation strategy to encourage the university community to walk, bicycle and take transit.  While the long-term measures identified in the plan include investment in renewable energy and energy conservation measures with a longer payback, less specificity is offered for this phase, because utility prices and options, technologies and fuel source availability are expected to be markedly different within a decade.   It ten years, it will be necessary to revise and update this plan.  ","Based on 2007 emissions, the university aims for 15% reduction by 2020, 30% reduction by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

At the request of former President Scott Cowen, in 2011 Provost Michael Bernstein convened a special task force and charged it with developing a Diversity and Inclusive Excellence (D&IE) Planning Roadmap as an integral component of the strategic planning process. The overarching aim is to embed D&IE across all aspects of university life--learning, teaching, research, service, and institutional effectiveness--in a measurable and sustainable fashion.

Tulane uses the term “diversity” in its broadest sense and takes into consideration the
issues of socio-economic status, geographic background, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, physical ability, sexual orientation and gender identity. 

The taskforce used an evidence-based approach to accomplish three goals: determine
baseline assets, strengths, and challenges; develop a set of university-wide D&IE strategic imperatives allowing for the development of measurable benchmarks; and create a roadmap consisting of a how-to guide and toolkit to foster embedding Diversity and Inclusive Excellence within the ongoing strategic planning efforts of every university unit.

Informed by the findings of these activities, the taskforce developed five strategic
imperatives that will define D&IE university-wide, going forward. These five imperatives serve as targets for Tulane’s highest diversity priorities and allow every unit within the university to align resources and programs accordingly.

These five D&IE imperatives direct the Tulane community to:
1. Sustain a diverse and inclusive Tulane community through successful recruitment and retention of faculty, students, and staff;
2. Embed D&IE in research, teaching, and service;
3. Strengthen the cultural competence of Tulane’s community;
4. Examine institutional policies and practices to ensure that they sustain Diversity and
Inclusive Excellence;
5. Ensure sustained and committed leadership in Diversity and Inclusive Excellence.

Task Force members have met periodically since August 2012 to strengthen existing and create new formal education programs in sustainability. Thus far, the Task Force has strengthened the existing Global Sustainability Minor (2012-2013), 2) is assessing feasibility of a sustainability graduate emphasis (current project), and 3) assessing feasibility of a sustainability graduate degree program (current project).  In parallel, during AY 2012-2013, through the former Environment Institute, the Task Force convened a Student Advisory Council on Sustainability Education (SACSE). SACSE meets monthly and pursues a range of projects aimed at supporting and informing the work of the Task Force.

The faculty Task Force on Sustainability Education has also commenced engagement with the Academic Senate leadership regarding the possible introduction of a proposal to create a general education requirement on sustainability for undergraduates at UCI (AY 14-15).","Abigail Reyes, Director, Sustainability Initiative, Office of Academic Initiatives",True,True,"In 2013, the Office of the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor created the interschool Sustainability Initiative. The Sustainability Initiative Three-Year Plan, created in December 2013, provides for the following campus services to advance sustainability in research:

“The Sustainability Initiative also provides the following campus services to strengthen sustainability scholarship intellectually and practically. Sustainability Science and Civics Implementation: the Initiative will offer training to faculty, staff, and students on identified challenges in team science and community engaged scholarship. To begin, the Initiative will host faculty development workshops that bring to Irvine faculty leaders from peer campuses with demonstrated success at engaged inter- and trans-disciplinary research in sustainability-related fields. These workshops will also draw upon UC Irvine’s own faculty members who have, through practice and scholarship, made headway into the “science of team science” and engaged scholarship. In AY 14-15, the first workshop on community engaged scholarship and research justice will be convened.

Research Development and Special Project Assistance: The Initiative helps develop faculty-led interdisciplinary research proposals and other special projects. Research proposal support comes in the form of research, writing, editing, project management, and project design. When appropriate, the Initiative coordinates such efforts with the Office of Research. Special projects support comes in the form of idea incubation, group facilitation, networking, resource sharing, and other staff expertise.  In AY 14-15, the Sustainability Initiative incubated the research, education, and community engagement activities of the oceans and coastal and marine faculty members into a new interschool coordinated effort. 

“Incentivizing and Rewarding Engagement: A key to deepening the scholarship of sustainability is valuing it institutionally, including financially."" In AY 14-15, in coordination with their deans and chairs, the Sustainability Initiative supported two assistant faculty members who have stepped up to take major service and leadership roles in sustainability education and engagement on campus.  We also created a student fellowship program for food and climate action.","Deliverables: Three faculty development workshops, three interschool engaged sustainability research proposals submitted, and six competitive awards to faculty and graduate student pairs.

TheSustainability Initiative aims to forward and deepen the intellectual conversation regarding the scholarship of sustainability at UC Irvine across discipline and sector, and among faculty, staff, and students. This work is both prerequisite to, and part of, our effort to mobilize serious interschool planning to make engaged sustainability scholarship and practice integral to UC Irvine’s excellence as a research and teaching university. Building Intellectual Community: Interschool collaboration is often driven by relationships. We [ ] foster[] professional relationships among Sustainability Scholars across schools and programs by using the Office of Academic Initiatives to bring scholars together in social settings that signal the campus’ institutional commitment, thus elevating sustainability scholarship in the eyes of individual faculty members, the deans, and strategic external partners. Deepening Dialogue: Whereas social events [] build community, the Sustainability Scholars Roundtable will challenge us to deepen our campus conversation about sustainability intellectually and across disciplines…Transforming Campus Culture: The Sustainability Initiative will work with the Green Campus Initiative to create a campus culture of sustainability in administrative areas of the schools and other units. While the Green Campus Initiative has accomplished a macro-level to shift in campus energy and water consumption toward climate neutrality and sustainability, we have yet to transform the daily experience and practices of our staff in most units.

“Civic Engagement Program—Maximizing Public Impact & Diffusing Innovation. The future of effective sustainability management will increasingly depend on the capacity of researchers, policymakers, NGOs, and private sector entrepreneurs to work together to co-generate research questions, co-produce knowledge, and take well-developed innovations from the field, classroom, and laboratory and apply them to practical problems at different spatial levels. Reaching Out: [In] partnership with
[the Office of] Community and Government Relations, the Initiative [] work[s] with Sustainability Scholars to build up our innovation diffusion through traditional outreach means (such as seminars, workshops, local community presentations, legislative outreach, and media placement) and faculty training to excel at such outreach. To design this work, the Initiative is first piloting a partnership with select interdisciplinary research programs to deliver, or support delivery of, the “broader impacts” objectives of the research programs (including impact on policy, students, curriculum, workforce, and relevant community stakeholders). If successful, the Initiative could expand to include a standing set of research impact programs through which any interested Sustainability Scholars could increase the public reach of their research. Inviting In: [The] Initiative [supports Sustainability Scholars] to bring stakeholders together periodically – as well as other national and international industrial and governmental user groups – through conferences, workshops, and symposia to identify future research activities on innovation diffusion…

“Community Engagement Program—Accelerating the Shift. The Community Engagement
Program threads together all of the research and education efforts of the Initiative to begin to position UC
Irvine to emerge as a driving force in maximizing the efficacy of efforts undertaken by sustainability practitioners worldwide. Three interconnected approaches guide our work to accelerate the shift to sustainability. We:

• provide technical assistance through research expertise,
• open up avenues for public discourse, and
• build capacity of relevant stakeholders to participate meaningfully in public discourse.

The Initiative fosters dialogue and offers training to researchers and community leaders alike about engaged sustainability scholarship and leadership, laying the foundation for research partnerships and joint initiatives. Tribal Community Engagement on Environmental Issues: While our interschool research engages a wide range of communities, we place special emphasis on establishing engagement with tribal communities. In so doing, we express an institutional commitment to sustainability’s social equity principle. In conjunction with faculty in the Schools of Law, Biological Sciences, Social Ecology,
Humanities, and Social Sciences, as well as the [UC Irvine] American Indian Resource Program, we develop research, education, and engagement opportunities related to tribal communities and the environment at UC Irvine’s main campus and at the Steele/Burnand Anza-Borrego Desert Research Center.

",True,True,The 1995 Green and Gold Plan provides guidance for the sustainable management of campus grounds and landscaping. The approved plant list for the Green & Gold Plan consisting of climate appropriate plants was updated in 2014. Further planning for sustainable landscaping can be found in the 2013 Water Action Plan which identifies strategies for sustainable water use on campus grounds and low energy stormwater treatment features.,"The Green and Gold Plan's goals and objectives follow:
Goal 1. Develop a landscape that is sustainable and provides for long term conservation of resources: energy, water, labor, and reduced production of green waste.

    Water Conservation—Utilize plant materials, design and planting techniques, and irrigation systems that minimize water usage.
    Plant Suitability—Use native and other environmentally suitable plant materials.
    Species and Age Diversity—Ensure both diversity of species and diversity of age in the urban forest. Trees of the same size and age tend to decline and die during the same period causing costly planning and maintenance problems and necessitating long periods of re-growth.
    De-Intensification of Eucalyptus Trees—Remove existing eucalyptus trees due to hazards or decline and replace with native and drought tolerant species which will introduce age diversity in the central campus.

Goal 2. Develop campus landscaping and open space networks that maximize local and regional natural resource values.

    Habitat Value—Utilize native plant materials that provide high wildlife foraging value.
    Habitat and Open Space Linkages—Develop habitat corridors utilizing UCI's historic drainage ways, or arroyos, that connect the campus with regional open space areas such as the San Joaquin Hills and the wetland areas of the Upper Newport Bay, San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh, and San Diego Creek. Protect existing habitat resources. Restore, as networks of corridors and habitat sites, the isolated patches and discontinuous landscape corridors that were created under the original LRDP development. This will benefit the campus and also support regional habitat planning goals.
    Preservation—Preserve natural features and environmentally significant areas. Retain the character of campus topography, ridge lines, view sheds, and vistas. Preserve historic landscape.

Goal 3. Develop landscaping that provides the greatest functional value consistent with comprehensive campus planning and design objectives.

    Maximize Functionality—Multiple functions, beyond aesthetic considerations, must be provided: define spaces, provide solar shading, define circulation elements, provide visual screening, reduce scale of monumental campus buildings, create public open spaces, and provide recreational amenities.
    Design Consistency—Implement campus landscape that is consistent with, and supports, campus planning and design objectives to provide a unifying framework, place identity, and human scale to the campus.
    Institutional Quality—Utilize plant materials, hardscape, and street furniture of institutional quality (i.e., long-lived, pest resistant, and durable).

Goal 4. While selection of appropriate plant materials and proper planting and irrigation techniques are crucial first steps in developing sustainable landscaping, it is equally important that adequate management programs are in place to preserve this asset.

    Pruning—Prune to remove hazards and to improve vigor and aesthetics.
    Fertilization—Environmentally responsible nutrient management to maintain plant health and reduce susceptibility to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses.
    Inspection—Scheduled inspections for overall health, safety, and appearance.
    Removal and Replacement—Even with good tree management, all trees will ultimately decline and require replacement. When removals are required, they are evaluated within these criteria: 1) dead or dying trees; 2) trees that pose a hazard to people or may cause significant damage to buildings, property, or hardscape; and 3) trees growing in undesirable locations.
    Protection—Control disease and pests through an integrated and environmentally responsible pest management program. Protect from physical hazards.
    Green Waste—To minimize waste and meet solid waste regulatory requirements, all trimmings should be processed into mulch and used to control weeds, control erosion, retain soil moisture, and provide nutrients.
    Habitat Areas—While habitat areas will generally require far less ongoing maintenance than more urban landscape areas, special management is required for protection of habitat value and for teaching and research activities in these areas.

Water Action Plan -

The 2013 Water Action Plan set a 30% total landscape irrigation water reduction target by 2020. To achieve this goal the campus is proposing the following strategies:
1. Remove underutilized turf and replace with California native plants or mulch
2. Improve irrigation system efficiency
3. Capture stormwater and reuse","The Green and Gold Plan was developed by the Office of Environmental Planning & Sustainability and is implemented by the UCI Offices of Environmental Planning and Sustainability, Design and Construction Services, and Facilities Management.

The idea is simple:

Begin on the ground, integrating the various arrays of existing health-related groups, programs, and activities the campus already has to offer
Utilize UCLA's cutting-edge research on wellness to create new approaches and programs
A “healthy campus” is a place that:

1. Fosters High Level Wellness by maximizing the potential of individuals to improve their health

2. Encourages Personal Responsibility by creating an environment that facilitates healthy living, while insuring that individuals are free to define health as they choose and insisting that there are no overt or covert “punishments” for those who chose not to participate

3. Respects Diversity by understanding that health and wellness are concepts that are frequently defined differently by people of varying ages, races, ethnicities, religions, social classes, genders, etc.

4. Strives to Reduce Inequities in Health by making the campus community aware of existing health disparities and creating interventions that reduce or eliminate them whenever possible

5. Is Integrative in acknowledging that body, mind, and spirit each has the potential to influence the other, and accepting that health and wellness emerge from the interaction of individuals and the physical and social/communal environments they inhabit.

Since then, the UC has gained further national recognition by demonstrating the unique role that higher education can play in addressing sustainability issues.

According to the 2009-2010 Capital Financial Plan, UCLA utilizes a variety of methods to ensure that the issue of environmental sustainability is addressed. The UC Sustainability Policy addresses sustainability and green buildings on the UC campuses. The Policy sets aggressive goals for the ten UC campuses to continue to reduce their carbon footprints. These goals represent a challenge for UCLA as the campus expands and demand for energy increases (through growth in the use of technology). Incorporating energy efficiency into new buildings and renovations as part of the Green Building Program has allowed UCLA to continue to reduce the amount of energy used on a square-foot basis, despite overall campus growth.

All buildings on the UC Merced campus are required to achieve USGBC LEED Gold certification or higher.,True,True,"UC Merced has a market-leading building energy-efficiency program that significantly reduces energy use and the climate impact of the university. The program requires new buildings to consume up to half the energy and demand of comparable university buildings in California and 30% less energy than required by Title 24, California’s energy efficiency code.  Additionally, our buildings are designed to demonstrate 40% water savings over a comparable university building.

Long Range Development policies and strategies include: 

SUST-2: Design campus facilities to achieve U.S. Green Building Council LEED Gold certification at a minimum, when employing all campus base credits. Establish a minimum of 20-25 LEED campus base credits by creating 
and implementing planning and design standards for all campus facilities and site development.  Temporary 
facilities (less than fifteen years life expectancy) shall strive for LEED Silver equivalence, unless recommended for exemption from policy by the Campus Physical Planning Committee and approved by the Chancellor.

SUST-3: Create a unique architectural identity for the campus by employing passive environmental systems, such as shading, orientation and roof configuration, as design features on campus buildings; employing sustainable materials; and designing campus buildings to employ renewable energy production systems.

SUST-4: Design buildings to maximize day lighting, occupant control over the interior environment, indoor air quality, and general indoor environmental quality. Wherever feasible and programmatically compatible, occupied building interiors should be naturally lit and naturally ventilated, as a priority in facility design. 

SUST-5: Design buildings to utilize exterior shading to reduce building cooling loads, and utilize exterior circulation systems such as arcades, loggias, or porches to protect major entries to ground floor functions, reducing the need for environmentally conditioned space in areas of high traffic.

SUST-6: Minimize grid connected peak electricity loads shifting electricity cooling (approximately 25% of total) away from peak electricity demand periods through chilled water thermal storage, gas or cogeneration-driven cooling, and/or solar power.

SUST-7: Install campus energy performance monitoring systems in all new buildings and other monitoring equipment to foster continuous improvement in indoor environmental quality and energy performance.  These systems will enable optimization of campus operations, inform improved design of future phases of the campus, and make the campus a “Living Laboratory” for study of engineering and resource conservation.

SUST-8: Explore the feasibility of acheiving water neutraility by determining UC Merced’s “water footprint” [(i.e., consumptive use of rainwater (green water), consumptive use of water withdrawn from groundwater or surface water (blue water) and pollution of water (grey water)]; Establish water footprint reduction targets for UC Merced and employ mechanisms to offset the environmental and social impacts of residual water footprints, such as, employing state of the art technologies, education, modeling new and cost-effective approaches in design and product selection.

water for landscaping are not metered. Thus, the campus staff have only rough 
estimates of the amount of water used for landscaping. Water usage in landscaped 
areas will be analyzed where building and landscape usage cannot be separately 
metered. Gathering data on where, when, and how water is used for landscaping will 
help to inform future irrigation policies and conservation efforts. 

• Develop a Landscape Irrigation Watering Strategy and Outreach Plan. The Landscape 
Irrigation Watering Strategy and Outreach Plan will outline best practices for landscape irrigation, as well as a plan for educating landscaping staff regarding best practices. Some best practices are, for example, to water only in the early morning or late afternoon hours to avoid evaporation. Another best practice is to irrigate landscaping according to the amount of water needed, based on the type of plantings and the actual moisture in the soil. The Landscape Irrigation Watering Strategy and Outreach Plan should be completed within 6 months.

• Within 6 months, identify turf areas to convert to low impact development and convert 25% of identified areas to low impact development in 3 years. Continue to reprioritize areas for turf replacement. About 84 acres of turf are planted on the UC San Diego campus. The majority of the turf areas are for specific programmed-functional uses. These turf areas include landscaped areas on the Main Campus and at all UC San Diego-owned housing areas. Also, remnant turf from older developments remain. Many of these areas could be converted to low impact development, a type of landscaping that uses significantly less water than turf, in addition to reducing stormwater runoff. This action is expected to cost $10 per square foot of area converted; the initial cost to convert 25% of identified areas is $450,000. However, converting these areas will create approximately $18,000 in annual savings through reduced water usage. If water prices rise, these savings will continue to increase. Currently, UC San Diego pays $4-5 for one hundred cubic feet of water, which is equal to 748 gallons. 
 
• Continue to replace non-native plants with native or drought-tolerant species, when 
possible. Replacing non-native plants with species that naturally require less water is a 
simple way to reduce water usage while still providing landscaping across the campus. 
This action applies to non-turf areas that are planted with non-native species.

The UC San Diego Procurement and Contracts Department has initiated a number of policies and programs to reduce the emissions and impacts associated with purchasing. For example, procurement staff have identified and begun to purchase green-certified products, such as Energy Star and Green Seal-certified products. In other examples, the staff have worked with vendors to reduce or eliminate packaging, and have begun to purchase more paper with recycled content. ","1. Achieve 50% PCW recycled content in all paper purchases by 2012. This goal represents an increase in PCW content of paper purchases of about 8% per year.

2. Reduce per capita paper usage from 1,568 to 1,066 sheets per person per year by 
2012; this goal represents an annual reduction of 8% from the baseline number of 
1,568 sheets per person per year from 2009-2012. This also represents a total reduction of 32% from the baseline of 1,568 sheets per person per year. The  Procurement and Contracts department will play a key role in achieving this goal.  However, Procurement and Contracts will not hold responsibility for achieving this goal, because reducing overall paper usage will require participation of all campus departments, and education of the entire campus community. 

3. Reduce the total amount of printers, copiers, and other applicable electronic equipment purchased and used. As with goal #2 above, the Procurement and Contracts department will play a key role in achieving this goal. However, Procurement and Contracts will not hold responsibility for achieving this goal, because reducing the total amount of equipment purchased will require the participation of all campus departments, and education of the entire campus community.


4. Improve the energy efficiency of all computers, printers, copiers, and other equipment used, using the guidelines from the new Climate Savers program. 

5. Increase spending on appropriate green vendors and products. 

6. Reduce the total emissions from the life cycle of materials purchased, used, and discarded on campus, including the emissions and impacts from extracting the materials, processing materials into products, transporting products to the campus for use, and transporting waste materials for final disposal or recycling. This goal includes the intention of finding local producers for materials, as well as local markets for recycling of waste materials, when possible. This goal is also related to Recycling and 
Waste Minimization, and is included in the Recycling and Waste Minimization section of this report.

The Climate Action Plan (CAP) builds on the UC San Diego Sustainability Assessment Report, published in November 2008, a document that creates a broad snapshot of campus sustainability performance in areas such as energy, water, waste and recycling, purchasing, land use and habitat, and other areas. Specifically, the CAP references much of the data and information included in the Sustainability Assessment Report. However, this report goes one step further by creating goals, timelines, and actions for achieving those goals, while the Sustainability Assessment was limited to program recommendations for improving sustainability performance. For example, the Sustainability Assessment Report included recommendations to increase monitoring and tracking systems for energy usage. This document includes GHG emission reduction goals. Implementing the recommendations in the Sustainability Assessment Report will create the tools that will be used to reach the emission reduction goals included in this plan.

Marjan Kris Abubo, Student  ",True,True,"The University developed an action plan for becoming climate neutral, which includes: a feasibility study for meeting the 2014 and 2020 goals (and) a target date for achieving climate neutrality as soon as possible, while concurrently maintaining the University’s overall mission. Climate neutrality means that the University will have a net zero impact on the Earth’s climate, and it will be achieved by minimizing GHG emissions as much as possible and by using carbon offsets or other measures to mitigate the remaining GHG emissions.
In accordance with these initiatives, the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) created a Climate Action Plan (CAP), approved by the Chancellor’s Campus Sustainability Committee in August 2009. The 2009 CAP was drafted with the best available data and methodology. It was intended to establish an institutional framework for the inventorying, annual tracking, and strategic reduction of GHG emissions, to be updated on a biennial basis. The 2012 CAP included revised GHG emissions baselines and reduction goals, as well as updated GHG emissions inventory results through calendar year 2010. Additionally, it included GHG emissions from commuting and University-funded air travel.  This was updated again in early 2014.
GHG emissions resulting from activities under UCSB’s operational control were inventoried and reported annually to the California Climate Action Registry (CCAR) for years 2004 through 2009. In 2010, UCSB began reporting to The Climate Registry (TCR), which has replaced CCAR. The 2014 CAP includes GHG emissions inventory results through calendar year 2012 and mitigation strategies as well as revised emissions forecasts. The total 2011 GHG emissions were 90,959 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MT CO2e), and total 2012 GHG emissions were 91,596 MT CO2e.
","The 2014 UC Santa Barbara Climate Action Plan (CAP) details the following GHG emissions reduction targets:	
•	2014:		2000 Emissions Level – 99,699 MT CO2e 
•	2020:		1990 Emissions Level – 90, 736 MT CO2e
•	2025:		Scope 1 & 2 Carbon Neutrality (Set by UC President Janet Napolitano)

UC President Napolitano’s Carbon Neutrality in its operations by 2025 goal, while a laudable goal which will inspire creative ways of reducing our GHG emissions, will only be achievable through financial partnerships with the UC-system and the State of California. UCSB will have to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 54,000 MT CO2e from 2025 projected BAU emissions levels and by 44,824 MT CO2e from projected emissions levels with mitigation (mitigation strategies outlined in section 5 of this CAP) in order to meet the 2025 carbon neutrality goal of zero net operating emissions. In addition to the $31 million (table 1) in estimated investment costs for mitigation strategies outlined in section 5 of this CAP, UCSB will need to invest $14.5 million in energy efficiency and conservation projects.
While large reductions can be made through energy efficiency and conservation, which have a considerable return on investment and payback period, at some point, emissions must be further reduced by increasing the use of renewable energy or by obtaining offsets. UCSB will need to spend an additional 7 million dollars in 2025 for the purchase of carbon free energy and offsets, increasing the amount needed to cover the annual utility budget to $18 million.

Form a System-Wide Committee  
Reaching Carbon Neutrality by 2025 will require coordinated efforts within the UC-System. Therefore, a multi-campus committee should be formed to explore what mitigation strategies are needed to meet the carbon neutrality target. Committee Members should include representatives from the UC Office of the President, the Sustainability Office and UC Office of the President, Facilities Management Services, Energy/Utilities group, and key faculty involved in energy efficiency research, and the main goal of the committee should be to find shared resources that will allow all campuses to reach the Carbon Neutral Goal.  
Some of the strategies our campus could explore include but are not limited to the following:
Reducing Energy Demand
1.	Complete an entire campus energy audit – Over the last decade, the campus has made tremendous efforts to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency measures, and most of the low hanging fruit has already been targeted. A complete campus building audit will help to identify where efficiency efforts are still needed and what projects will have the greatest energy savings. 
2.	Extend funding for future energy efficiency projects - The SEP has been the most effective mitigation strategy for the campus. Continued funding for energy efficiency projects, either through the continuation of the SEP or a similar program, will be crucial in helping to meet the carbon neutral goal.  
3.	Increase energy savings behavior – Energy savings behavior will need to be increased through education and outreach, as well as by energy incentive programs that penalize energy wasting behavior (see sections 5.4).
Increasing Renewable Energy Supplies
1.	Advocate more renewable options from SCE – emissions from purchased electricity account for just over 30% of campus’ total emissions. Increasing the amount of renewables UCSB purchased above the 33 percent renewables by the 2020 standard will greatly decrease campus emissions. 
2.	Biogas procurement – Substituting natural gas with Biogas would greatly reduce scope 1 emissions. One option is for the Campus to procure biogas through a purchase agreement with a local gas company.  For example, BioFuels Energy, LLC (“BFE”) secured long term bio-gas rights from the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Facility and has developed the first commercial project in California to purify wastewater treatment digester gas for injection into natural gas pipelines.  Under a long term Power Purchase Agreement, BFE has agreed to provide 2.8 MW of Biogas to the University of California, San Diego.   Another option would be to build a campus biodigester that could be fueled by campus waste. UC Davis received a research grant from the Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) program of the California Energy Commission to develop and construct a pilot-scale anaerobic digester system that will be fueled by campus waste and produce enough biogas to generate approximately four million kwh of electricity annually. 
Purchasing offsets
1.	Purchase renewable energy credits and offsets – Offsets will need to be purchased if the University cannot secure enough renewable energy to cover natural gas and electricity demand. Offsets will also need to be purchased for emissions from propane and diesel usage which cannot be eliminated or substituted.
At some point, emissions must be further reduced by increasing the use of renewable energy or by obtaining offsets. Emissions from electricity can be eliminated with the purchase of 100 percent renewable energy, while emissions from natural gas, propane, and diesel usage that cannot be eliminated or substituted will require offsets. 
PROJECTED FUTURE EMISSIONS AND REDUCTIONS
UCSB’s forecast of GHG emissions between 2012 and 2020 contains several specified reduction measures:

1.	Conservation:  emission reduction estimate - 2,374 MT CO2e, resulting from behavioral change. Based on case studies, a 5 percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 is achievable if the campus successfully decentralizes the main utility budget. 
2.	On-site Renewable Energy: emission reduction estimate - 498 MT CO2e, resulting from build-out of renewable energy generation capacity on campus. The campus is currently adding photovoltaic arrays on the roof of parking lot 22; the project began construction in October 2013 and will be completed in June of 2014. Additionally, the campus plans on adding two large photovoltaic arrays (approximately 500 kilowatts each) before 2020, resulting in a build-out of an additional 1000 kilowatts of on-site solar production. 
3.	Strategic Energy Partnership: emission reduction estimate: 6,272 MT CO2e, resulting from energy efficiency projects. These projects are funded through utility incentives, capital project costs, and UC bond financing. 
4.	Air Travel Reduction: emission reduction estimate: 1,724 MT CO2e, resulting from reduced travel budgets, coupled with increased use of video conferencing. This CAP assumes a 5 percent reduction in air travel through incentivizing teleconferencing over in-person travel. In further iterations of this CAP, air travel emissions will be revised through a standard UC approach currently under development. Additionally, the university has no formalized programs to incentivize video/tele-conferencing, but promoting/subsidizing this alternative shall be actively pursued.  
5.	Commuting Reduction: emissions reduction estimate: 1,016 MT CO2e’ resulting from housing new population growth in proximity to campus. 
UCSB’s planned mitigation and reduction measures put the campus on a trajectory to achieve the 2020 emissions targets.  Additional measures will be necessary in order for the campus to achieve GHG neutrality by 2025. UCSB will have to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by an additional 44,824 MT CO2e in order to meet the 2025 carbon neutrality goal of zero net operating emissions. This will require a $14.5 million in energy efficiency projects and a $700,00 annual investment in conservation efforts. While large reductions can be made through energy efficiency and conservation, which have a considerable return on investment and payback period, at some point, emissions must be further reduced by increasing the use of renewable energy or by obtaining offsets. UCSB will need to spend an additional 7 million dollars in 2025 for the purchase of carbon free energy and offsets, increasing our annual utility bill significantly; currently, it is around 12 million dollars annually.","David Austin, Executive Director, Institute for Energy Efficiency

Our vision is for a campus community in which all members of the community have access to healthy food that is good for people and the planet. This will be a system where people have a direct connection to their food system and where we work towards regional self-sufficiency. The campus will also actively support such practices in the neighboring and global communities through our food choices, policies, operations, and academic programs. 

BACKGROUND 
Environmental

There is a general consensus among scientists and practitioners that the foods that are good for our bodies, our minds, and our communities are the same foods that are good for our planet, including the climate. Our food system is intimately connected with the biophysical environment, including the climate, so food justice, environmental justice, and climate justice are intimately connected—they cannot be separated. Therefore, long-term food justice includes not only personal and community physical, emotional, and intellectual health, but environmental health as well. We seek to build partnerships with local farmers and food producers to help us to source food that is humane, grown/raised following environmentally sound practices, and produced with respect to farm workers and other service workers. In our kitchens and restaurants, we are committed to following green business practices and continuing our participation in the Santa Barbara County Green Business Program. We also aim to ensure that our food system operates in a closed loop where we collect compost and, as a result of that, grow more food.

Social

In this food system, all students will have access to affordable, healthy, culturally-relevant, and sustainable food options. Workers at every stage of the supply chain will have access to fair wages, working conditions, and food that nourishes their bodies and cultures. We seek to create a culture on campus that is knowledgeable and energized about food in general and in the role that food plays in our lives.

Economic

Hunger is the result of institutional challenges and barriers students face every day, whether it be the high cost of tuition, lack of access to affordable and quality housing, transportation costs, medical expenses, employment, limited class availability, and much more. In order to address food security, we must take into account the financial landscape that affects our students. These issues need to be addressed at the individual, community, and institutional levels through partnerships that build and support new businesses and financial institutions and purchasing models which support our goals. We will also seek opportunities through partnerships to build/support new businesses/financial institutions and purchasing models which support our goals. Historically, we have been successful in helping Harvest Santa Barbara become established, creating a business structure which enabled us to make many more local purchases.","SHORT-TERM GOALS (2015-2017)

Achieve a climate neutral campus through energy efficiency, conservation, on-site generation, and strategic procurement of clean and renewable energy.

BACKGROUND 
With respect to energy, the overarching sustainability goals shall be to reduce and ultimately eliminate the use of non-sustainable sources, particularly fossil fuel based energy, in meeting UCSB’s energy needs and to reduce and ultimately eliminate and/or offset all greenhouse gas emissions, primarily but not limited to CO2, CH4, and N2O resulting from UCSB’s operations. ","SHORT-TERM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. UCSB will continue to implement energy efficiency projects under the UC/CSU/IOC Statewide Energy Partnership program through the 2016 program cycle; an increasing emphasis will be placed on reduction of onsite natural gas combustion in order to mitigate Cap and Trade compliance costs and local air quality regulatory risk. Ten energy efficiency projects have been identified and $990,000 has been allocated for energy efficiency projects through 2016 at the time of writing, with a goal of achieving a 15% Internal Rate of Return on the project portfolio.
2. The campus will strive for a total campus average energy density (kBtu/sq ft/yr) reduction of 8.0% on a five-year rolling average basis.
3. Make energy usage and cost more transparent and tangible to the individual entities (individuals, buildings, departments, etc.) in order to support a decentralized energy utility budgeting structure, where all consumers will have an incentive to reduce energy consumption through increased accountability. This includes the electrical sub metering of all buildings larger than 4,000 square feet with real-time data reporting to the Facilities Management Energy Information System and data access for the campus population.
4. Complete energy benchmarking analysis for all buildings larger than 4,000 square feet to identify current baseline building energy consumption.
5. Establish a short-term financing mechanism and identify appropriate support resources to assist individual entities (including individuals, departments, programs, etc.) in planning, funding, and implementing energy conservation projects that can demonstrate a reasonable return on investment. This may include the current TGIF grants, but should ideally include a larger pool of money for example in the form of interest-free loans.
6. Complete a feasibility study and economic analysis of expansion of the Hot Water Loop and construction of Phase I electrically-driven heating infrastructure.
7. Complete solar thermal installations at five existing residence halls.
8. Complete data room inventory for campus.
9. Engage the off campus community as well as students, staff, and faculty in the revision of the UCSB Climate Action Plan.
10. Develop a comprehensive understanding of energy production sites for the electrical grid in the campus’ sub region. Identify what communities are most affected by those sites and what the effects are.
11. Establish a policy to divest from coal and tar sands.
12. Sign the Climate Resiliency Pledge via Second Nature.
13. Explore the possibility of divesting from all fossil fuels. 


MID-TERM GOALS (2018-2020)
1. Increase the campus’ percentage of electricity consumption from renewable sources to 43% total electricity consumption by 2020.
2. Achieve 1990 level climate emissions reduction target.
3. Maintain trajectory of total campus average energy density (kBtu/sq ft/yr) reduction of 8.0% on a five-year rolling average basis.
4. Incorporate mitigation of sea level rise into Climate Action Plan.


LONG-TERM GOALS (2021-2025)
1. Achieve carbon neutrality in Scopes I and II greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Divest from all fossil fuel companies.

To increase biodiversity of the campus flora, maintain it as a living collection, and raise awareness about sustainable practices and self-sustaining systems, while reducing dependency on fossil fuels, extracted minerals, pesticides, and potable water. 
BACKGROUND 
The University of California, Santa Barbara established the Sustainability Change Agent Landscape/Biotic Environment Team in 2004. Their mission is to make sustainability one of the key components in making decisions for grounds design and management. Sustainability includes considering all inputs to grounds relative to their costs and benefits to the earth and the local ecosystem. Their directive is to increase biodiversity and self-sustaining systems, while reducing dependence on fossil fuels and other extracted minerals. Socially, the group seeks to facilitate student education and work and play, while supporting the staff through living wages and  local business opportunities. UCSB is also home to The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity & Ecological Restoration (CCBER). CCBER manages over 230 acres of open space on the UCSB campus in order to fulfill several goals: to preserve and enhance native plant resources and biodiversity of the region; to provide educational opportunities through signs, internships, seminars, and workshops; and to advance the understanding of restoration strategies and preservation of ecological function in urbanized areas to retain water quality and biodiversity through research. CCBER management areas include areas that already contained portions of intact vegetation or wetlands which are protected by the Clean Water Act and Coastal Act, as well as areas that are being restored after significant human impacts: the North Bluff, Campus Lagoon, Manzanita Village, Storke Wetlands, and San Clemente.","SHORT-TERM GOALS (2015-2017)

To be a leader and catalyst in our region and the State in terms of human mobility options, advancing alternative fuels, and carbon neutral vehicle deployment.

BACKGROUND 
The Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) at UCSB has made enormous efforts to reduce commuter emissions by equipping students, staff, and faculty with the resources they need to reduce their GHG emissions by choosing alternative means of transportation. The Program is heavily used by staff and faculty, as well as by students that do not live on or around campus. Only 37% of the faculty and staff commute to the campus by alternative methods. Currently, 92% of students commuting to campus use alternative modes of transportation. This percentage has remained fairly stable over the past five years. In addition, UCSB supports 11 vanpools that run throughout Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties to reduce commuter miles, gasoline consumption, and GHG emissions. Alternative campus commuters can also benefit from bike lockers, showers, and clothes lockers, as well as access to a car share program on campus. All of the efforts made by the staff, students, and faculty on campus have enabled the campus to reduce its climate impact related to transportation. All of the efforts made by the staff, students, and faculty on campus have enabled the campus to reduce commuter miles, gasoline consumption, and GHG emissions. ","SHORT-TERM GOALS (2015-2017)
Devise and implement a Strategic Transportation Plan (STP) to get us on a path to reduce commuter related GJG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2025 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The STP will include the following:
a. Decrease single occupant vehicle ridership by faculty and staff by 10% (from 2015 baseline) by 2025.
b. Decrease single occupant vehicle ridership by 2050, so no more that 30% of all employees and students commute via this mode.

To make UCSB a Zero Waste university by ensuring waste management programs and practices effectively promote the reuse, reduction, recycling, composting, and repurposing of materials, as well as encouraging the rebuying of recycled material.

BACKGROUND 
FY 2014-15 saw UCSB’s waste diversion percentage drop from 71% to 70%. The percentage decrease this past FY can likely be attributed to that fact that Average Daily Cover (ADC) is no longer counted as a diversion method by UCOP. While the State of California still recognizes ADC as a diversion practice, it will cease to do so in 2020. Taking that into account, UCSB’s waste diversion rate has appeared to have plateaued at the 70% mark. Looking ahead, UCSB will look to improve its diversion rate through continued recycling efforts and more importantly, through expanding the existing but limited compost infrastructure. UCSB’s waste management efforts are designed to eliminate the impact on the natural environment. Waste reduction and reuse efforts help to eliminate the consumption of items and materials on-campus. This effort helps to not only reduce disposal efforts, but also decreases UCSB’s indirect consumption of natural resources from purchased goods. Recycling and composting allow the University to dispose of their items in a manner that either allows the material to be turned into a different, new product, or to be returned to the environment through decomposition. These aforementioned efforts are of the utmost importance to UCSB, as we aim to reduce our environmental footprint.","SHORT-TERM GOALS (2015-2017)
1. Continue replacing paper towel dispensers with hand dryers.
2. Work with procurement to prioritize the purchase of compostable and recyclable goods in Gateway.
3. Improve waste management/ disposal procedures and protocols for student organizations and events.
4. Expand indoor and outdoor compost programs.
5. Continue to host education workshops regarding source reduction and waste management.
6. Encourage additional research into behavioral economics of waste management.
7. Upgrade waste infrastructure at the Events Center
8. Host first-ever Waste Reduction/ Diversion Challenge in residence halls.
9. Continue to improve waste diversion efforts.
10. Continue to identify additional vendors that may not provide safe work environments for employees.
11. Continue to map outdoor waste receptacles and eliminate unnecessary landfill receptacles where applicable, as well as look into locations where service may be difficult for staff members in an effort to reduce risk of injury.
12. Expand use of reusable hand towels and/or paper towel composting in residence halls.
13. Explore the option of collecting Styrofoam for recycling with NEPCO Inc.
14. Develop additional outreach programs including social media announcements and smart phone apps that provide information on proper waste management efforts, including composting at home, recycling efforts, and procurement tracking.

MID-TERM GOALS (2018-2020)
1. Zero Waste: For the purposes of measuring compliance with UC’s zero waste goal, locations need to meet or exceed 95% diversion of municipal solid waste. Ultimately, UC’s zero waste goal strives for the elimination of all materials sent to the landfill by 2020.
2. Reduce packaging material.
3. Improve reuse/ surplus programs through Central Stores.
4. Improve donation efforts for used goods.
5. Establish on-site composting facility.

To assist in protecting and conserving water resources, with an emphasis on reducing potable consumption through conservation, efficiency practices, and behavior change.
BACKGROUND 
Fiscal Year 14-15 saw UCSB reduce its potable water consumption by 2.7 Mgal compared to the previous year, and, since FY11-12, UCSB has reduced its potable water consumption overall by 30%. This reduction is a major accomplishment for the campus and follows a long tradition of similar reductions and proactive water resources management. With the drought extending well into the upcoming fiscal year, UCSB also established a voluntary goal to further reduce water consumption 12% by March 1, 2016, compared to a 2013 baseline. This goal mirrors the call from Governor Brown to collectively cut urban water use by 25% and utilizes the same 12% reduction percentage that was assigned to Goleta Water District by the state. UCSB’s effort to conserve and use water efficiently, as well as to manage stormwater, reduces the University’s environmental impact. California is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts on record, and with supplies throughout the state stressed, it is of utmost importance that UCSB reduces consumption in an effort to help alleviate demand throughout the state. In addition, much of the water distributed in Southern California is sourced from elsewhere in the state. With a portion of UCSB’s water portfolio coming from the State Water Project, a significant amount of energy is used to move, heat, cool, and treat water; thus, reducing water consumption also results in energy savings. 
","SHORT-TERM GOALS (2015-2017)
1. Reduce potable water consumption 12% by March 1, 2016, compared to 2013 baseline.
2. Introduce pool covers at H&RS pools.
3. Continue restroom retrofits with efficient fixtures.
4. Establish a departmental incentive program for water conservation.
5. Recycled water extension for landscaping areas.
6. Establish a fixture audit group/ class.
7. Commit to conserving water and continuing with conservation practices in wet and dry years.
8. Continue building town and gown relationship through constructive engagement and workshops.
9. Look into waterless car wash technology.
10. Pilot the use of recycled water in cooling tower infrastructure.
11. Retrofit existing meters and install real-time metering systems.
12. Update Water Action Plan.

MID-TERM GOALS (2018-2020)
1. Recycled water extensions into buildings.
2. Landscape conversions.
3. Gray water laundry to landscape systems in residence halls.
4. Reuse process water on-site.
5. UCOP policy: Reduce per capita potable water use 20% by 2020 (achieved).

Our vision is for a campus community in which all members of the community have access to healthy food that is good for people and the planet. This will be a system where people have a direct connection to their food system and where we work towards regional self-sufficiency. The campus will also actively support such practices in the neighboring and global communities through our food choices, policies, operations, and academic programs. 

BACKGROUND 
Environmental

There is a general consensus among scientists and practitioners that the foods that are good for our bodies, our minds, and our communities are the same foods that are good for our planet, including the climate. Our food system is intimately connected with the biophysical environment, including the climate, so food justice, environmental justice, and climate justice are intimately connected—they cannot be separated. Therefore, long-term food justice includes not only personal and community physical, emotional, and intellectual health, but environmental health as well. We seek to build partnerships with local farmers and food producers to help us to source food that is humane, grown/raised following environmentally sound practices, and produced with respect to farm workers and other service workers. In our kitchens and restaurants, we are committed to following green business practices and continuing our participation in the Santa Barbara County Green Business Program. We also aim to ensure that our food system operates in a closed loop where we collect compost and, as a result of that, grow more food.

Social

In this food system, all students will have access to affordable, healthy, culturally-relevant, and sustainable food options. Workers at every stage of the supply chain will have access to fair wages, working conditions, and food that nourishes their bodies and cultures. We seek to create a culture on campus that is knowledgeable and energized about food in general and in the role that food plays in our lives.

Economic

Hunger is the result of institutional challenges and barriers students face every day, whether it be the high cost of tuition, lack of access to affordable and quality housing, transportation costs, medical expenses, employment, limited class availability, and much more. In order to address food security, we must take into account the financial landscape that affects our students. These issues need to be addressed at the individual, community, and institutional levels through partnerships that build and support new businesses and financial institutions and purchasing models which support our goals. We will also seek opportunities through partnerships to build/support new businesses/financial institutions and purchasing models which support our goals. Historically, we have been successful in helping Harvest Santa Barbara become established, creating a business structure which enabled us to make many more local purchases.","SHORT-TERM GOALS (2015-2017)

Marjan Kris Abubo, Student  ",True,True,"Investment is covered by the UC Sustainable Investment Framework:

The world is changing and investors must keep abreast of how growing awareness of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks spreads rapidly via social and other media to influence markets. At the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents (OCIO) we believe ESG risks can present opportunities and that addressing these factors is in line with our fiduciary duty.

Some of our stakeholders have voiced concerns regarding the impact ESG risks could have on the future growth of our endowment and retirement funds. We have listened carefully to these concerns through meetings, one-on-one encounters and written exchanges. Based on this stakeholder engagement, as well as extensive research on ESG risks and opportunities, we agree that certain material ESG factors will increasingly become a focus of risk assessment for long-term value creation in the years to come. We continue to actively study how our peers and fund managers are improving measurement of these variables for integration into investment decision-making and are working to bring ESG evaluation more holistically into our investment culture.

There are key ESG risks that are driving new economic and financial trends and that can guide our investment decisions and fund manager selection and monitoring. This list is not intended to be static, but represents important core universal principles we keep in mind as we aim to ensure the best return on investments for our university and its many stakeholders.

These principles include the following trends and considerations:

Climate Change: Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system.[1] A transition to a lower carbon economy, including low carbon sources of energy, is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of future generations. Given the scale of existing infrastructure and the challenge of quickly shifting the transportation sector to low carbon fuel sources, this transition requires a multi-generational effort.
Inequality: Addressing inequality is not only a responsibility but also an opportunity.[2] Solving inequality of opportunity can create new demographics that can contribute to economic progress and widen the market for goods and services, thereby creating a more profitable and sustainable business climate.
Human Rights: Businesses whose profits are derived from direct harm to public safety, the unlawful deprivation of human dignity, or the exploitation of children or other vulnerable workers undermine universally approved United Nations principles and create a serious threat to the conditions needed for a well-functioning, market-based global system.
Food and Water Security: Global climate change, population growth and rapid urbanization are intensifying the strain on global water and agricultural systems. Human well-being is inexorably linked to water and food security, and failure to adequately ensure these basic needs for future generations will undermine global economic welfare, human security and political stability.
Diversity: Diversity enhances economic, social and environmental outcomes for business and society.
Ageing Population: Rapid aging of populations will be a transformational force affecting society and the global economy, requiring new approaches to health systems, workforce organization, intergenerational relations and public finance.
Circular Economy: The “take, make, dispose” pattern of growth is an unsustainable economic paradigm. We must transition to a more circular economy in which intelligent design allows us to decouple economic growth and development from consumption of finite resources.
Ethics and Governance: Our market economy system relies on trust as a fundamental cornerstone. Good corporate governance and proportionate, transparent and responsible regulation are vital to well-functioning and sustainable financial markets. As long-term investors, we seek the sustained returns associated with strong governance, rather than the rapid gains that can vanish quickly if they are rooted in corruption, fraud or falsification. Recent financial crises highlight how destructive such fraud and corruption can be to the proper functioning of credit markets and the preservation of personal and corporate wealth.","Putting our capital to work advancing solutions to the world’s most pressing environmental and societal challenges. We have committed to allocating $1 billion over five years to climate change solutions, a decision that was recognized by the White House as part of its Clean Energy Investment Initiative. We are building strategic partnerships with the public sector, with our financial peers, and with industry and academic groups. These strategic partnerships will give us access to new opportunities and magnify our collective voice in the pursuit of sustainability.","University of California OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF THE REGENTS:

The University of California, Santa Barbara is committed to global leadership for sustainability through education, research, and action. The concept of “sustainability”
can be used in many ways, but in the Campus Sustainability Plan (CSP) it is defined as: “Meeting the needs of the present generation, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”",True,"The Campus Sustainability Plan (CSP)  is a dynamic document intended to provide a roadmap for major steps toward achieving sustainability over the next 15 to 20 years. The Chancellor’s Campus Sustainability Committee (CSC) selects priorities each year.
These committees and subcommittees developed a series of recommendations, goals, and objectives for various time-frames: Short-Term July 2015-June 2017, Mid-Term July 2018-June 2020, Long-Term July 2021-June 2025 and vision for 2050.

At the University of California, Santa Barbara, we envision a future where we
have little to no impact on the environment, and everyone is engaged in sustainability.
We are committed to fostering a culture of sustainability through campus-wide sustainability efforts, program development, and promulgating the sustainability work of staff, faculty, and students – our greatest renewable resource. UCSB strives to capitalize on our position as an institution of higher education to ensure that all students understand the inter-connectedness of environmental, economic, and social systems and to communicate that we each have a role to play in sustainability.

More specifically, we aim to research, create, and implement solutions for a more
sustainable future. We want all students graduating from UCSB to be motivated
to integrate sustainability into their future professions, embedding sustainability
throughout the workforce. We envision that all members of our campus community
will have access to healthy foods and lifestyles and will be able to meet
their needs today and in the future with minimal impact on the needs of others.
Finally, UC Santa Barbara continues to seek to do business with companies that
are integrating sustainability into their strategic planning and operations, as
well as assisting their workers in meeting their own needs. Thus, we believe that
building sustainable partnerships will result in a stronger local economy.
In order to achieve this vision, UC Santa Barbara continues to prioritize and
monitor the implementation and progress of its sustainability initiatives. We
encourage and coordinate the efforts of our faculty, staff, and students who are
the front line of positive change by taking action today for a better tomorrow. By
working with all sectors of the campus community, we look forward to helping
UCSB maintain its leadership and attain its shared vision of a sustainable future.",http://www.sustainability.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/15_Sustainability_Plan_JS_2_4_16.pdf,This information is based upon the 2015 Campus Sustainability Plan.

The objectives for the project included:
·      Ensuring the process provided the level of technical detail necessary to ensure a robust analysis and recommendations,
·      Engaging not just with staff during the technical study, but also faculty and students,
·      Ensuring the deliverables were highly visual to easily communicate results and assist in helping decision makers to quickly comprehend impacts, and
·      Considering the life cycle and total ownership costs of potential strategies for meeting the goals.
The strategies for the project included:
·      Conducting Level I & II energy audits for 50 of the campus’ most energy intensive buildings, which included over 2.5M SF;
·      Conducting a campus-wide District Systems Energy Audit to optimize the heating hot water and chilled water loops, and cogeneration plant;
·      Conducting a Renewable Energy Feasibility study that considers solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, fuel cells and photovoltaic-thermal hybrid technologies;
·      Developing a techno-economic scenario analysis tool that helps the campus to develop an optimized set of potential strategies that includes the cost and emissions impacts of projects, policies, and procurements;
·      Engaging faculty and students by supporting the development of a Living Lab that enables climate change mitigation research, technology development and experiential learning opportunities.","UCSC engaged a group of pioneering consultant team members to partner in developing the CES.  The process resulted in a final set of recommended strategies for achieving carbon neutrality that includes specific projects, procurements and policy revisions, years of implementation, costs (labors, material, etc.) and emissions savings.  The CES also included the development of 350 energy conservation measures in 50 buildings, 20 photovoltaic, solar thermal & fuel cell projects, 12 district system level energy conservation measures, and an additional 700 energy conservation measures extrapolated across all other buildings.  

To develop these strategies, all energy measures were input into the custom-built techno-economic scenario analysis tool, which generates metrics such as emissions savings, net present value, savings-to-investment ratio, cash flow, cost/MT CO2e, etc. through 2055.  The CES Team developed 50+ scenarios, analyzed the results, formulated strategies and recommendations, and is finalizing development of a dynamic plan for implementation. This plan will be a living document that evolves as market conditions change, the campus adds/revises projects, best practices are refined.

The Tool provides great flexibility and simplification to modify scenarios and metrics to explore many strategies for neutrality and regulatory mitigation, evaluating cost and emissions impacts of emphasizing different approaches such as onsite projects, procurement, lowest first-cost, emissions reductions, and cost/ton of MTCO2e reduced. 

The energy efficiency and renewable measures include energy savings, incentives, materials/labor costs, and financing metrics in absolute-referenced spreadsheets.  The data is easily imported into the Tool and Higher Education Partnership planning documents, which significantly reduces the time involved in developing new energy projects.  This enables UCSC to easily update data, revise results and adjust recommendations. All measures will be shared widely and can be used as project templates.  UCSC is capturing all details in the process so it can be replicated and plans to share widely all CES resources, including providing a copy of the excel-based scenario analysis tool along with a user manual (and training for UC campuses).","Sustainability Office, Physical Planning and Construction, Planning & Budget, Capital Planning & Space Management, Physical Plant (including the Work Management & Energy Services Departments)","The Sustainability Office funded the 2016 Climate Neutrality Initiative Faculty Champion to develop a Sustainability Living Lab with designated physical space, programming and staff to support research, teaching and experiential learning around sustainability and climate action with the goal of becoming a model where our built environment will serve as a “classroom” for sustainable living.

Overall goals for 2013–16 include measures to exceed UC Sustainable Practices Policy; pursuing NetZero on major capital projects; developing sustainability policies for small projects; research and piloting of innovative technologies;  and continuing UCSC’s sustainability leadership. Step by step, by 2020, the campus will be established as a model of comprehensive “greening” in planning, design, construction, operation, and

Partner with research entities on and off campus to explore new technologies (e.g., Electric Power Research Institute).  (In progress: the Carbon Neutrality Initiative has created a Research Committee that is facilitating many UC-wide initiatives to support climate mitigation & adaptation research.  UCSC will be hosting a Carbon Slam this spring; a competition to crowd-source and accelerate the best student-initiated ideas for carbon solutions.)
For each new major capital project assess the feasibility of achieving “Net Zero” energy use.  (In progress: So far, each new capital project has set a design target of ""net zero"" energy use and UCSC will be hosting a Net Zero Design Workshop for all Project Managers on 06/04/16 to continue supporting innovative design and construction efforts.)
Create a pilot web-based tool that allows users to view operations information for three types of campus buildings (e.g., classroom, administrative, residence hall).  (In progress: UCSC has integrated SkySpark, a web-based energy analytics software that talks to the building management system.  It has piloted two buildings and is continuing to add new buildings to the database.) 
Identify, share, and acknowledge established sustainability practices that occur within facilities. (In progress: the Energy Services Department is hosting monthly meetings with campus stakeholders to discuss energy efficiency projects and share best practices with various departments including Information Technology Services, Physical Planning & Construction and Campus Housing.  It is also hosting quarterly meetings with the PG&E Higher Ed.

",True,True,"In March 2012, UCSC signed the Real Food Campus Commitment, a nationwide student-based campaign promoting food sustainability on university campuses. Due to UCSC’s innovative food sourcing, the campus has already surpassed the Real Food goal of 20%, with more than 28% sustainable food purchases. The campus has set a 36% goal for 2016 and plans to reach 40% by 2020. In addition, 25% of UCSC’s fresh produce is certified organic (2012), with more than 50 percent of all fresh produce locally sourced. More than 85% of seafood served is certified by the Monterey Bay Seafood Watch Program. All Dining Services sites are now certified green, and the campus is promoting certification by vendor-operated facilities.

Per UCOP Sustainable Practices Policy, achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 are the campus’s overarching goals.

The primary program supporting advancement of energy efficiency in existing campus buildings is the Higher Education Energy Efficiency Partnership Program (i.e. SEP).  SEP provides approximately $2M/year in low-interest financing from the UC Regents for participating campuses to borrow to implement energy efficiency projects that provide an 85% or less debt-service ratio.  The 2016-2018 SEP Project Portfolio estimates 316 kW reduction, 1.9M kWh savings, and 66K therm savings.  

The UCOP Sustainable Practices Policy requires that all new Buildings be at least Silver LEED certified and strive for Gold.  It also requires that new buildings over $5M be designed to 20% better than Title 24 code, which is a very energy efficient code to begin with.  At the campus level, the Sustainability Office is developing Energy Use Intensity (EUI) targets for all building types to encourage net zero design.  The two newest building design projects on campus are adopting these very aggressive EUIs; a four-story student 80K SF housing complex is designing to an EUI of 20 kbtu/SF and an administrative/classroom 40K SF building is designing to 23 kbtu/SF in an attempt to support net zero design goals.  The campus is also in the early stages of developing a Request for Proposals for a Power Purchase Agreement for up to 3.6MW of solar photovoltaics on the main campus. 
 
In 2016-2018, UCSC will build on these accomplishments, further reducing the campus’s carbon footprint through training, education and behavior change programs, as well as through energy efficiency- especially targeting intensive spaces, cleaner energy supply and technology, and expanded staff and fiscal capacity to effectively implement energy initiatives.","The timeframe for implementation of these objectives and strategies is through calendar year 2016.

The Investment Policy Committee and the Board of Directors of the University of Colorado Foundation have adopted a set of Shareholder Responsibility Guidelines regarding socially and environmentally responsible investments.

The body does have multi-stakeholder representation.

The policy notes: “The University of Colorado Foundation, to the degree to which it can reasonably evaluate the impact of a proposition, will attempt to vote for propositions which seek to eliminate or reduce the social injury caused by a company's activities to the degree that there is no negative economic impact to the Foundation’s assets.""","The University of Colorado Foundation adheres to a Sudan Divestment Policy.

As part of that policy, a negative screen of the entire investment pool is conducted annually. Securities that could be in violation of the policy are identified and managers are then formally asked in writing to sell positions that violate the terms of the policy. This has been done in writing on more than one occasion over the last three years.",CU Foundation,--,--,The EC is expanding sustainability more robustly into the social justice arena via repurposing its Energy & Climate Justice Program to better partner with multi-cultural groups and people on campus and better develop the sense of sustainability from simple environmental resource conservation into broader human impacts.,Establish new partnerships with multi-cultural groups every year.,E-Center,,True,"In numerous places and in numerous ways both explicitly and implicitly, environmental dimensions of sustainability are incorporated into the strategic plan, Flagship 2030. For instance: ""All facilities will be constructed with materials and methods emphasizing sustainability and environmental awareness, consistent with the university’s longtime commitment to the environment."" [page 55]
Again, in numerous ways, social dimensions of sustainability are supported in the strategic plan. For instance, ""As we add new [faculty] positions, we will also identify and implement strategies for enhancing our faculty diversity. A significant increase in new and diverse faculty will help us remain competitive in the quality of teaching and the educational experience for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students."" [page 33]
Indeed, social elements are part of two of the core initiatives in the plan:
1) Learning for a Diverse World. Implement new strategies for improving diversity; foster a supportive and inclusive climate for all.
8. Serving Colorado, the Community, and Our Graduates. Expand outreach programming aimed at Colorado communities; enhance opportunities for lifelong and distance learning.
Likewise, both social and financial sustainability principles are detailed in the strategic plan. For instance, ""We will enhance student financial support by doubling both merit and need-based financial aid within the next five years; we will initiate a statewide dialogue on how
Colorado can expand access to higher education.
CU-Boulder is committed to recruiting outstanding students from a diverse talent pool throughout the state, the nation, and the world. In particular, we want to provide access for qualified Colorado residents, regardless of their ability to pay.
Although financial aid has been the fastest-growing budget item for the past four years, we still lag behind our peers in overall funds available to help attract the best
students. Clearly, we need to increase our financial aid investment if we are to compete for outstanding undergraduate students. At the graduate level, we also
must enhance stipends, health care, and housing to recruit top-tier graduate students. Our overall recruitment strategies must reflect our intent to build a
diverse student body that is more representative of the world today and tomorrow.""

“Goal 3) Act and Interact. Students will cultivate self-awareness and understanding of their impact—locally, nationally, and globally. Students will be prepared to participate effectively in a society that encompasses diverse experiences, perspectives, and realities. This area includes [among others]:
Sustainability—understanding the interaction between human development and the natural environment”.
In order to achieve the terms of this goal, students will learn about key principles of sustainability including social equity, environmental protection, and economic development, among others. The sustainability GE goal will be achieved by integrating teaching about sustainability within discipline-specific coursework and/or other GE components, or in general elective courses.
Sustainability: one course in student’s 120 cr. hr. Bachelor’s degree addresses Sustainability. This content can be integrated in major, gen. electives, or GE courses.","How will the integrated Sustainability component be structured and supported?

Departments will identity how the Sustainability component already is/could be integrated into their major degree course content--either taught to students in one specific course, or integrated across several major degree requirements.
If having the content of Sustainability integrated into the major degree coursework is not a viable option, students will take a course addressing sustainability in their other GE or general elective courses. Many courses in the campus-wide GE curriculum (for examples, those in the Gateway, Explore curriculum, or Advanced Core) will address this content for those students. Integrated course content or courses addressing sustainability should adhere to the guidelines explained below.
Tenured/tenure-track faculty and instructors will have access to educational resources to identify existing courses/ course content addressing sustainability and, where appropriate, to adapt existing course content or to develop new courses/ content to achieve the objectives of the Sustainability component.

As a result, UConn has also adopted Water Conservation Goals and Strategies as part of its 5-year Water Supply Planning process (most recent WSP adopted in 2011-12). Pursuant to this WSP, UConn has also adopted a Student Water Conservation Outreach Plan and a Drought Emergency Response Plan that requires UConn to issue voluntary and mandatory conservation advisories to all water supply system users in the event flow rates in rivers near our water supply well fields drop below specified levels, measured in cubic feet per second (CFS) according to real-time in-stream flow gauges monitored by the USGS 

As the owner/operator of the public water supply system for the main campus and surrounding municipal, commercial and residential users, UConn has implemented both supply-side (http://uconnoep.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/stretching-uconns-water-budget-part-i/) and demand-side water conservation measures. UConn's unaccounted for loss is now half of the public water supply system average.   

Several years ago, UConn retrofitted the irrigation system, and moisture retention capabilities of its new varsity field hockey turf, resulting in an 80% reduction in water used for irrigation of artificial turf before practices and games, as is required for safety and playability among NCAA Division 1 Field Hockey programs.

Across campus there is growing interest in local food systems,
ecologically sound production methods, and socially just treatment of food producers. While Colorado is a major agricultural producer, many local farmers using ecologically sound practices are only able to sell at a premium directly to consumers, or are too small to ensure consistency and quantity while also covering liability required for campus dining services. These products commonly increase operating costs that are passed on to the consumer. At the scale of campus dining, large buying agreements may limit purchasing flexibility to buy from small, local food suppliers. The scale of the global food system complicates efforts to identify food sourcing and production practices, making goal setting, data collection, and progress reporting a challenging task.
Opportunity:
Colorado plays an integral role in the food profile of the country, with almost three-fourths of the state’s overall production devoted to livestock and livestock products. Colorado is also an important producer of potatoes and onions, and the production of beans,
apples, and peaches are is on the rise. All of these products are either in season or available during the academic year due to storage or harvest methods. Local food promotes wellness and community benefits. It can contain higher levels of nutrients, promote a stable food supply, reduce shipping miles, and increase revenue for local communities. Campus interest, a reported willingness to pay more for these products, and external marketing value provide impetus to explore local food options.

compost, and landfill). We diverted only 23.6% of this total from the landfill to recycling and compost. With the rollout of recycling and composting programs to additional buildings, there are management barriers to tackle. Overlapping responsibilities for waste removal, knowledge gaps in waste practices, and inadequate bin and dumpster infrastructure are some of the many challenges facing an integrated and responsible waste program.

We were successful in terms of not just maintaining, but expanding the total campus tree population (lost 11 trees and planted 50), and we were even able to maintain total tree biomass in 2015 (removed and replaced a total of 117"" dbh). 
• Mitigating Urban Heat Island Effect: In an effort to combat Louisville's particularly bad urban heat island effect, the University of Louisville seeks to target its tree plantings around parking lots & the west sides of buildings (e.g. the native Black Gum planted 10/20/15 SW of Miller Hall which will grow to 50' at maturity). We're also having to replace trees dying due to increased heat stress with more heat tolerant species (e.g. we replaced 3 dying 18"" Locus from the SW corner of MITC, College of Business & President's parking lots).

In addition to our objectives with respect to trees, we have achieved the goal of converting all major lawn equipment to natural gas power to reduce emissions, noise, and gas spills.

By seeking ways to reduce waste first, including decreased packaging, use reusable items instead of disposables, recycle everything that can be recycled, and compost organics, UofL has made a significant dent in its garbage disposal while recycling is increasing.  In 2014, UofL recycled over 4.6 million pounds of waste, which was 55.7% of the total waste stream. There is a Zero Waste Plan in the Sustainability Council Operations Committee approval process.
Details about our sustainable waste plans are at: http://louisville.edu/sustainability/operations/recycling.html","The charter of the Solid Waste Reduction Committee includes the following objectives:
•	Promotion of recycling program--increasing awareness, understanding of program, individual prompts to increase recycling
•	Changing University-wide culture to normalize recycling--behavioral change, institutional change
•	Improving on current methods and discovering new opportunities to reuse items University-wide
•	Goal setting--developing university-wide goals, matrices to measure progress, a reporting system, and feedback mechanism to the University community
•	Custodial staff--training, development of policies regarding waste disposal (e.g. if a recycling bin has mixed waste and recyclables how should the bin be handled?), performance review standards
•	Waste reduction--identification of specific waste streams that can be minimized or eliminated, modification in purchasing selected items (e.g. should we buy whitepaper without wrappers for each 500 sheets?)
•	Recycling at special events--sports venues, conferences, catering, other large events
•	Pre and post-consumer food waste composting

We have a goal of diverting >90% of the university waste by 2020. The university currently has a single stream recycling program, organics collection for composting (both on and off campus), electronic waste recycling, battery recycling, spent lamp/bulb recycling along with a Total Materials Management joint contract with the city that recycles construction & demolition waste, used tires, scrap metals and other items recyclable in the Louisville market. We have participated in Recyclemania for over 5 years achieving recognition each year. UofL also has move in and move out recycling events where “Trash Talkers” help direct people to recycling dumpsters, trash bins or the UofL Free Store. 

In 2013, the UofL student organization GRASS (Group Recycling and Sustainable Solutions), teamed up with the Sustainability Council and Campus Housing to open the Free Store for the on-going free exchange of clean, durable items like clothing, shoes, electronics, small appliances, household items, bath & beauty supplies, books, school & art supplies, non-perishable food, and more.

GRASS has a faculty advisor and works closely with the Assistant to the Provost for Sustainability Initiatives.",True,True,"As a part of the Energy Savings Performance Contract that the university has entered, there have been (and continue to be) low-flow fixture and valve retrofits to existing buildings. As a part of our commitment to LEED, all new buildings and major renovations are constructed with efficient showers, faucets and toilets/urinals. Some new buildings, such as our LEED Gold certified Student Recreation Center and the Clinical & Translational Research Building have been designed to capture condensate and/or storm water for use in irrigation. Details on these building-based water efficiency measures are here: http://louisville.edu/sustainability/operations/buildings-energy.html

Besides building-based water efficiency measures, Grounds and Athletics have also adopted conservation measures for watering grounds and athletic fields. UofL seeks to minimize irrigation and water waste through a mix of high-tech and low-tech means. The first strategy is to plant primarily natives (or hardy non-natives) which do well in our local climate with minimal irrigation. We use soil probes and rain sensors to determine if irrigation is necessary. In 2009, a ""Rainbird SMT"" smart controller was installed at Thrust Theatre to control irrigation based on soil type, plant type, topography, and historical evaportranspiration & weather data for Louisville. Details on water efficiency in Grounds are here: http://louisville.edu/sustainability/operations/grounds.html

Finally, UofL been implementing significant plans around stormwater management and flood control. In recent years, UofL made several changes to campus landscaping, parking lots and rooftops, with the help of $1.25 million in cost-sharing from the Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD). In 2015, MSD confirmed that UofL's projects are diverting about 72 million gallons of stormwater every year. We think that this significant investment will essentially pay for itself by helping prevent millions of dollars in future flood damage. We are also hoping the projects at UofL will serve as an example for similar projects across the city on both public and private property. MSD's investment in Belknap campus stormwater projects is part of an $850 million agreement that MSD made in federal court with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators in 2005 to reduce the incidence of combined sewer overflows into waterways during storm events. Details about our Stormwater efforts are available at: http://louisville.edu/sustainability/operations/stormwater.html","UofL's Energy Savings Performance Contract with Siemens Building Technologies Inc. spells out specific objectives, strategies, and timeframes for achieving guaranteed energy and water savings from over $50 million worth of efficiency retrofits over the 13½-year contract. The contract will directly save the university over $4.4 million every year and reduce our annual carbon dioxide emissions alone by over 46,000 tons (the equivalent of removing 7,690 cars from the road). With these improvements, UofL expects to reduce its utility bill by about $12,086 per day. The university’s unofficial goal was to reduce water consumption by 30%, and these efforts have already produced documented results. In FY 2011-12, Belknap Campus reduced water use 31%.

The development, implementation and outcomes of each unit plan are responsibilities of the administrative head of each respective CSD (College/School/Division).  Each unit plan must be consistent with and/or build on the pertinent sections of the University’s Strategic Plan and the Council on Postsecondary Education state-wide diversity planning requirements.  These requirements include measuring progress in the following areas:  student diversity, student success, workforce diversity and campus climate.  
 Each unit plan must address the criteria outlined below—by appropriate unit “type.”  Further, each criterion must be addressed by answering a series of questions—and each answer must include:  
• clearly stated action steps; 
• a clear delineation of responsibility and accountability; 
• a time-table, expected outcomes; and 
• an assessment plan that produces quantitative as well as qualitative data.
Each unit is assigned a diversity liaison through the Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity.  Liaisons work with the unit diversity committees to provide advice and best practice information to assist the units in meeting their diversity goals. 

Units submit an annual report to the Vice Provost indicating progress or challenges in meeting their unit goals.  The reports are submitted to the Provost and she holds the vice presidents and deans responsible for the progress of their unit plans.

Because diversity is a key component of the university’s strategic plan and is built into the President’s scorecard, the President reports the results to the Board of Trustees.

Affordability – Cardinal Covenant  
In 2007, the University of Louisville initiated a special program called the Cardinal Covenant in response to college costs and the challenge for students from low-income families to fund their education. The University of Louisville's Cardinal Covenant is the first program of its kind in the state of Kentucky. This program will make college attainable for the 22.6% of Kentucky families living at or below 150% of the federal poverty level as published by the U.S. Census Bureau (Data obtain from the U.S. Census Bureau).

",True,True,"Get Healthy Now was launched in 2005 as an integral part of a comprehensive employee benefit package. It is a voluntary, incentive based program.  Participating employees receive a $40 monthly premium incentive for participation ($480 annually).  Additional incentives can be earned based on program-specific participation.  The program is open to spouses, qualifying adults, and retirees. In 2012-13, the University of Louisville completed a full renovation of the Humana Gym, and reopened in April 2013 as the Get Healthy Now Wellness Center at Humana Gym. The 22k square foot employee-based facility offers comprehensive well-being support through health and wellness classes, coaching, motivational programs, state-of-the-art fitness equipment, integrated clinical care and friendly, professional staff. Our team of onsite professionals leveraged the opportunity to provide enhancements to core UofL programs (Weight Management, Smoking Cessation, Stress Management, etc.), additional Health Improvement Programs and challenges, highlighting monthly awareness campaigns and events, and supplementary programming such as personal training, membership specials, health and fitness assessments, and more. Creative engagement strategies include tapping into multiple campus resources to engage individuals at all levels of wellness. Advancing sustainability in health, wellbeing, and work, Get Healthy Now promotes wellbeing throughout the campus and broader community through coordinated, strategic interventions designed to mitigate top lifestyle drivers of cost (lack of physical activity, obesity, and stress). Details at: http://louisville.edu/gethealthynow","UofL adopted a self-insured health plan in 2002 for its 6500 employees and saw no material gains as our health care costs outpaced the national average. The health scorecard of the Commonwealth of Kentucky ranks among the poorest in the nation. In light of these daunting realities, UofL launched Get Healthy Now in 2005 as voluntary incentive-based program designed to nurture culture of health; incent and engage employees as part of total rewards; contain health care costs; and decelerate rate of increase in overall cost of coverage. Two positive return on investment analyses (see section 6) have provided solid evidence of impact on maintaining or improving the health status of our participants. In 2013, the University of Louisville expanded and relocated our employee based wellness center to create increased capacity for the geographical reach of our wellness efforts. This expansion resulted in a 50+% increase in the membership and utilization of services.  As evident in the numbers shared below:
2012: January – December 2012 Total employee memberships = 653
2013: January – December 2013 Total employee members = 1314
2014: January – December 2014 Total employee members = 1860
2015: January - December 2015 Total employee members = 2076
Percentage increase: 69%

Get Healthy Now has achieved the mandate given in 2005 to ‘build a sustainable program with measurable impact.’ This is evident in the year over year success in bending the curve of our healthcare trend and the numerous awards recognizing UofL’s workplace health promotion efforts. The GHN Wellness Center competitively positions the University for continued growth well into the 21st century as it is aligned to the research, teaching and service mission.

",True,True,"The Office of Waste Management and Sustainable UMass are working with the Chancellor's Sustainability Committee for the University Administration to officially adopt and implement a new recycling policy in order to meet new state waste ban regulations.  

Here is the policy text:

""Subject: Mandatory Recycling Policy

Purpose: Massachusetts environmental regulations (310 C.M.R. 19.017 – Waste Bans) prohibit the disposal of a wide range of specific recyclable or compostable materials in the state’s landfills and incinerators. The University must comply with these regulations or face possible fines and load rejections. Waste disposal facilities are required - within certain limits - to reject UMass waste shipments containing excessive quantities of banned materials. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection is empowered to issue fines of up to $25,000 per violation/per day against the University for ongoing violations of the waste ban regulations.

Action: It is the policy of the University of Massachusetts/Amherst that each member of the campus community (staff, faculty and student) is individually must recycle and to compost their solid waste in accordance with the requirements of the Massachusetts Waste Ban regulations.  Acceptable recycling and composting practices - as specified in UMass Recycling Guidelines - are hereby instated as a Campus Community Standard.  As such, this standard shall be enforced (including reports of violations) by all UMass department heads, staff supervisors, residence directors, and faculty – among their staff and  within their respective areas of authority (e.g., faculty are the most immediate and appropriate authority within campus’ classrooms, auditoriums and laboratories).

The facilities and collection schedules necessary to support the mandated recycling and composting efforts are provided by the Physical Plant, Residential Life and Auxiliary Services operations departments. The Physical Plant’ Office of Waste Management will continue to lead and to supervise this program through dissemination of the UMass Recycling Guidelines, provision of appropriate recycling/composting containers and collection services, and through monitoring of waste materials disposed by the campus community in order to identify the source of careless or deliberate violations of this policy.""
","Reuse: New2U Program will expand from one residential area in 2014 to 2 areas in 2015, 3 in 2016, and so on until all of Residential Life is offering reuse options to students during move-out.
Recycling Rates: Increase the 30% residential recycling rates to help achieve 60% campus wide rates by end of 2015.","John Pepi, Solid Waste Manager, Office of Waste Management, Physical Plant

Ezra Small, Campus Sustainability Manager, Physical Plant",True,True,"The Physical Plant recently received a Class A Reclaimed Water Application from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to use reclaimed water at the Commonwealth Honors College Residential Complex cooling towers.  The Amherst campus currently requires about 340 million gallons of water per year and the RWTF can process approximately 200,000 gallons of reclaimed water per day. Boiler water make-up for steam production utilizes the full capacity of the RWTF during the heating season. The addition of the cooling towers at the Commonwealth Honors College will maximize the reclaimed water capacity during the cooling season. This would result in a potential reduction of potable water consumption of 73 million gallons of water per year (21%).

Huston-Brumbaugh Center for Environmental Science",True,True,"As stated in our Campus Sustainability Plan, “University of Mount Union has committed to climate neutrality. We define climate neutrality as our institution having no net emissions of greenhouse gasses. The following is excerpted from our ACUPCC commitment:
“Within two years of signing this document (for University of Mount Union the due date was May 15, 2010), develop an institutional action plan for becoming climate neutral, which will include:
1.	A target date for achieving climate neutrality as soon as possible.
2.	Interim targets for goals and actions that will lead to climate neutrality.
3.	Actions to make climate neutrality and sustainability a part of the curriculum and other educational experiences for all students.

5.	Mechanisms for tracking progress on goals and actions.”
University of Mount Union will reduce its energy consumption through conservation and efficiency, and by switching to cleaner and renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind, geothermal, and low-impact hydropower. At Mount Union, energy consumption is the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. In addition to accelerating climate change, energy generation from fossil fuels, especially coal, produces air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, dioxins, arsenic, cadmium, and lead. These pollutants contribute to acid rain as well as health problems such as heart and respiratory diseases and cancer. Coal mining and oil/gas drilling can also damage environmentally and/or culturally significant ecosystems. Nuclear power creates highly toxic and long-lasting radioactive waste. Large-scale hydropower floods habitat and disrupts fish migration.

Implementing conservation measures and switching to renewable sources of energy can help Mount Union save money and protect us from potential utility rate volatility. Renewable energy may be generated locally or regionally and allow us to support local economic development. Furthermore, we can help shape markets by creating demand for cleaner, renewable sources of energy.”

As outlined in our Campus Strategic Plan, in order to ensure sustainable management of our resources, “and further elevate the student educational experience, Mount Union pledges to direct attention to strategic fund-raising goals, cultivate meaningful partnerships with alumni and friends and develop a deeper appreciation for our faculty and staff. Stewarding the physical campus will be at the forefront of these efforts as well, with a focus on the acquisition of new properties and building initiatives that confirm our commitment to sustain¬ability leadership.


As future campus plans are implemented, Mount Union’s commitment to serving as a leader in the higher educa¬tion sustainability movement will not diminish. Guided by a progressive and challeng¬ing Sustainability Plan, we will continue to build with LEED standards as the norm while providing education and awareness on sustainable practices; incorporating “green” principles into our operations, administration and financial structure; and carrying out the definitive actions of the accompanying Climate Action Plan.”
","EXCERPT FROM CAMPUS SUSTAINABILITY PLAN
Target Dates
We propose to reach climate neutrality based on our Scope 1 and 2 emissions NO LATER THAN COMMENCMENT DAY IN MAY 2046, which is the bicentennial year of our institution’s founding. For purposes of the ACUPCC, climate neutrality is defined as having no net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to be achieved by minimizing GHG emissions as much as possible, and using carbon offsets or other measures to mitigate the remaining emissions.

INTERIM TARGETS:
2010-2015-Focus on conservation
We will continue to find ways to CONSERVE energy. We will improve our monitoring capabilities and expand our educational efforts to increase energy efficiency and minimize waste. This will be our top priority for the five year period 2010-2015. Pending further study we anticipate that conservation measures could reduce our energy consumption and GHG output by 10-20%. Conservation is the least expensive step and should actually reduce net university expenses. During this time we will continue retrofits to existing buildings, design new construction and renovations according to best practices (LEED or similar), expand our metering of individual buildings, and support expansion of sustainability education in our curriculum.

2010-2030
We will begin studying possibilities to improve the EFFICIENCY of energy consumption focusing primarily on buildings (HVAC, lighting, improved building envelopes). We propose that a revolving capital improvement fund be established that will provide for investments in buildings, HVAC equipment, and controls that will improve efficiency. The saving realized from initial investments would then be reinvested on future energy saving improvements, with those savings again reinvested. This procedure would continue indefinitely so long as the investments have a definable return period. This will be an ongoing process that could reduce our energy consumption by 30-40% of current levels over 30 years. This process would include both retrofits of existing buildings, construction of new buildings, and changes in all areas of our operations.

We will immediately being investigating the possibilities of ONSITE PRODUCTION or energy collection, such as solar voltaic, solar thermal, geothermal heat pump, and small wind. The potential of these will depend on both economic and technological development. The potential for reducing GHG emissions could range from 1 to 10% or more depending on costs and efficiencies.

We will immediately being investigation of the possibility of acquiring OFFSITE ALTERNATIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY, possibly through consortia or agreements with other institutions. Our intent is to encourage the development of regional alternative energy sources such as wind, or possibly biomass, that may not be feasible on-site or locally but that would stimulate the economy in our state and region and provide great energy independence. Current Ohio law mandates that by 2025, at least 25% of all electricity sold in the state come from alternative energy resources. At least half of the standard, or 12.5% of electricity sold, must be generated by renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, or biomass. At least half of this renewable energy must be generated in-state. This law should allow us to more easily purchase renewable energy as well as to have a market for any renewable energy that we produce on campus.

We will investigate and implement measures to reduce the carbon output from commuting and transportation. We will also continue to improve our waste management and recycling practices. These will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions that come from landfill gases. These will be described more in later sections. 
The costs of some of these initiatives may be quite large and will be undertaken only after a thorough examination of the short and long-term costs and benefits. An initial capital investment into efficiency related items could achieve significant savings that could go back into a revolving fund to initiate additional efficiency measures or on-site energy production.

2031-2046
During this period we will continue to monitor conservation and efficiency, but we will also need to begin considering ways to fulfill our commitment to net zero emissions. We will investigate and utilize OFFSETS and CREDITS only as a last resort to fulfill our commitment. We anticipate that the market for these items or some appropriate replacement will be well established and adequately monitored and regulated so that we can make prudent decisions as to how to offset our emissions that we are unable to eliminate through other means.
2015-2020
1.	Increase efficiency in existing and new buildings and activities.
a.	Retrofit and replace HVAC in existing buildings as recommended by the energy audit.
b.	Design new buildings to meet or exceed LEED Gold level certification for energy efficiency, and meet or exceed current or most energy-efficient energy code requirements for envelope, mechanical, and lighting.

Goal 	By 	Principal means 
25% 	2015 	Primarily conservation and efficiency 
50% 	2025 	Above plus renewable and onsite generation 
80% 	2035 	Above plus some credits and local offsets if needed 

",Physical Plant and Sustainability Management Advisory Committee,"As stated in our Campus Sustainability Plan, “University of Mount Union desires to maintain and renovate existing buildings and construct new buildings that reflect the best available sustainability practices so as to create healthy environments for users of the buildings and reduce operating costs. At University of Mount Union, buildings are by far the largest users of energy and the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions on campus. Buildings also use significant amounts of potable water. University of Mount Union will therefore design, build, and maintain buildings in ways that provide a safe and healthy indoor environment for inhabitants while simultaneously mitigating the building’s impact on the outdoor environment.”
As stated in our Campus Master Plan, “Building projects should be designed to LEED Silver standards, at minimum; new buildings should be sited and massed to take advantage of solar orientations for smart energy use, daylight harvesting and the comfort of building users; an east-west building orientation is the most effective for energy efficiency. However, due to existing campus conditions, east-west orientations are not always possible; buildings should be planned for flexibility of use; building materials, interior and exterior, should be procured regionally, be environmentally friendly and recyclable when possible. Materials should be durable and require minimal maintenance; new and renovated buildings should be designed with efficient and effective thermal envelopes, including walls, roofs, windows and doors; new and renovated buildings should be designed with smart and energy-efficient mechanical, electrical and technological systems; geo-thermal systems, efficient boiler and chiller systems, radiant heating and cooling systems, integrated controls systems, low-flow fixtures and grey water capturing should be considered for mechanical and plumbing systems; energy-efficient light fixtures and devices (occupancy sensors) should be considered for electrical systems; programs, protocols and products that lessen energy consumption in computers, audio-visual equipment and information technology should also be studied; buildings should be teaching tools for environmental stewardship.”

The potential of these will depend on both economic and technological development. The potential for reducing GHG emissions could range from 1 to 10% or more depending on costs and efficiencies.

We will immediately being investigation of the possibility of acquiring OFFSITE ALTERNATIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY, possibly through consortia or agreements with other institutions. Our intent is to encourage the development of regional alternative energy sources such as wind, or possibly biomass, that may not be feasible on-site or locally but that would stimulate the economy in our state and region and provide great energy independence. Current Ohio law mandates that by 2025, at least 25% of all electricity sold in the state come from alternative energy resources. At least half of the standard, or 12.5% of electricity sold, must be generated by renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, or biomass. At least half of this renewable energy must be generated in-state. This law should allow us to more easily purchase renewable energy as well as to have a market for any renewable energy that we produce on campus.”

In essence, we must evolve as a uniquely-diverse and culturally-supportive community to ensure the enrichment of the educational experience, promotion of personal growth and encouragement of critical thinking. At Mount Union, diversity is broadly conceptualized to include international and national differences as well as group distinctions (ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, ability and political and religious affiliations) and individual characteristics (learning styles and personalities). Such diversity and inclusion ultimately foster an educational climate characterized by variety of thought and evoke poignant discussions that highlight an array of viewpoints, assumptions, values and perceptions. In sum, diversity is an essential component of academic excellence that leads to a richer understanding of the issues that shape our world and an intrinsic appreciation of the value of all people. In order to enhance the diversity of our campus community, key objectives include, foster an inclusive campus environment; increase the number of U.S. minority and international students; increase U.S. minority retention and graduation rates; increase the number of full-time U.S. minority, female and international faculty; increase student exposure to intercultural experiences; create new intercultural opportunities for faculty and staff.”

In order to build a sustainable society, diverse groups will need to be able to come together and work collaboratively to address sustainability challenges. People of color and low-income communities tend to suffer disproportionate exposure to environmental problems. This environmental injustice happens as a result of unequal and segregated communities. To achieve environmental justice, society must work to address discrimination and promote equality. Higher education opens doors to opportunities that can help create a more equitable world. The historical legacy and persistence of discrimination based on racial, gender, religious, and other differences makes a proactive approach to promoting a culture of inclusiveness an important component of creating an equitable society. In addition, a diverse student body, faculty, and staff provides rich resources for learning and collaboration.”

",The Office of Marketing,"FROM OUR CAMPUS SUSTAINABILITY PLAN
Our working definition of sustainability is derived from the most common definition, the 1987 report of the UN Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future, which defined “sustainable development” (sustainability) as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Embedded in that definition are two important elements: 
1.A long-term view (generations)
2.A systemic or ecological sense of life
Thus, sustainability is about the interdependence of living organisms and communities (both human and nonhuman) over the long haul. Instead of seeing environmental, social, and economic needs as a collection of discrete characteristics or problems, sustainability looks at them as interdependent and connected. Each has an impact on and consequences for the others. Because this plan is necessarily long-term in nature, it focuses on principles rather than specifics. Just as a college frequently adds, deletes, and modifies courses in its curriculum in response to changes in knowledge and student and societal needs, we recognize the need for flexibility to respond to inevitable but unpredictable changes in economics and technology
",True,"One of the six guiding principles in our Strategic Plan is to ""manage resources sustainably""
Throughout the strategic planning process, it became clear that the six strategic initiatives that have guided Mount Union’s efforts throughout the past five years are still very much relevant for the future.

•	Improve condenser water temperature and tower fan optimization, lowering condenser water supply temp when possible
Renewables were investigated, but did not prove to be financially feasible at the time. 

The Matrix established by the Sustainability Council called for research into the feasibility of on-campus alternative energy production, then produce 2% of campus energy needs through on-site renewable energy by 2015. Based on the CAP research and economic conditions in NC, this goal must be postponed.  

For behavior change, the Matrix called for implementation of a pilot behavioral-based energy conservation campaign, with a goal of a 5% reduction in energy use per building, with 6 buildings in the pilot program. This was to be conducted by Spring of 2011. A program was piloted in Spring 2012, resulting in a 7.5% reduction in participating buildings.

Beginning with the 2013-14 academic year, the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee for Equity, Diversity and Inclusive Excellence established their own goals and objectives for the year. The 2013-14 committee was also divided into three sub-committees charged to conduct a final review and provide recommendations on the following areas:

1) Employee Recruitment and Hiring Process;
2) Faculty Recruitment, Retention, and Promotion and Tenure; and
3) Undergraduate and Graduate Student Recruitment, Retention and Graduation.

Based upon the findings of the sub-committees (See Attached Sub-Committee Reports), the committee unanimously voiced their desire for administration and the university community to engage and take action to move their recommendations regarding diversity and inclusive excellence initiatives forward. The committee felt strongly that engaging the campus community in the diversity/inclusive excellence objectives was critical for the success and continued evolution of the university in the local, state and global marketplace. Reflecting upon past recommendations as well as those included in the current 2014 sub-committee reports, attached is a listing of all committee recommendations to the university outlining whether the suggested recommendations were acted upon or tabled for future implementation. It is also recommended that the university place all recommendations which it intends to act upon into the master plan (or institutional strategic plan) to ensure resource allocation and appropriate start dates for each initiative are established.","Recommendations from Student Recruitment, Retention, and Graduation Sub-Committee:

Future research needs to be conducted to discover why the White student population enrolment rates at UNCG are decreasing, and what efforts need to be undertaken to recruit, retain, and support a White student population.

It should be a requirement that ALL Executive AVC, Department Deans and assigned Hiring Managers attend training classes to enhance the awareness of diversity hiring and their guidelines to diversified workplace.
We recommend working with the Staff Senate to develop and offer open dialogue meetings with staff about communication across campus, including the possibility of special speakers. We recommend the review of and discussion about the current process of communicating and marketing available programs and services UNCG. We recommend the inclusion of a strong diversity message in the strategic plan the Chancellor is currently developing.
If there is underrepresentation of one or more of the federally protected groups (women,
minorities, disabled persons, veterans), in the applicant pool, AND, there is an underutilization in that particular, job group, recruitment efforts should be expanded to include additional advertising in additional diverse recruiting sources. All postings should be posted externally to in at least two diversity recruitment resources at the
onset. Create a Human Resources dashboard to measure the health of UNCG. Establish HR metrics, national, regional, and peers benchmarks to be identified. Recommend the hiring of Chief Diversity Officer like sister universities.

Administrative & Supervisory Hiring Practices Sub Committee:

All administrative searches would integrally involve consultation with an HR Liaison,
including open positions that involve internal or external candidates. At least one HR Liaison, someone with expertise in diversity enhancement and promotion, would provide consultation as a full member of each search committee for positions at the Dean level and above; this individual(s) would be consulted and participate at all stages
that involved decision points in the process.
Training would be provided to three groups, each for unique purposes: (a) HR Liaisons
obtain training in how to best advise search committees on preparing position announcements, enhancing inclusiveness in the applicant pool, and consideration of inclusiveness in the interview process; (b) Existing administrators obtain diversity training; (c) Leadership workshops targeted for UNCG faculty and staff of underrepresented groups to encourage leadership skill development within our existing

The University also has one of the lowest ratios of vehicle parking spaces to campus users in the nation.


Since 1988 the University has made available free bus passes to the entire campus population, with the ability to ride anywhere in the service district. The Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO) paid $1,,400,000 for students and the University paid $335,000 for faculty and staff to receive this benefit for 2015. Financial and priority parking incentives for carpoolers and a guaranteed ride home program for faculty and staff who ride the bus to campus have been in effect for several years.

The Bike Program is the most recent addition to alternatives offered.  The program makes short and long-term rentals available and provides tools and training to maintain bikes. Overall, this is an area where the University has already made great strides. Maintaining these alternatives to driving are important, though significant additional emissions reductions are unlikely. 

In the next update of this Climate Action Plan, we plan to include a model that estimates reductions in commute emissions based on increased MPG and introduction of electric cars to the market.

New development projects will be required to treat the equivalent amount of stormwater runoff as required by city code; however, some of the area treated will be shifted outside the project site to address campus areas with relatively low water quality—streets and parking lots.","""All new development projects will treat stormwater run-off from a portion of an existing street or parking area instead of treating the equivalent amount of relatively clean on-site, impervious surfaces, primarily defined as pedestrian surfaces such as sidewalks (especially those that do not drain directly into a stormwater pipe). The same amount of impervious surface will be treated, but the dirtier surfaces will receive greater attention.

For example, if a project site has 1,000 square feet of sidewalks that must be treated, the project would not be required to treat this area; instead, it would be required to fund 1,000 square feet of stormwater treatment for an existing campus street or parking lot.

The cost to treat existing streets and parking areas will be determined by establishing an average cost/square foot. The project is not responsible for implementing the off-site stormwater measures. Funds will be deposited into a central fund earmarked for stormwater treatment measures. Campus Operations will manage the fund and appropriately implementat measures needed to equal the required stormwater treatment from new development projects.

Projects should be designed to accommodate the potential to treat all of their stormwater in the future.

Student Recruitment and Enrollment
Since 2009, the number of enrolled undergraduate African-American students has increased 10.6%, Hispanic enrollment has increased 63%, students identifying with two or more races have increased by 36.5% and non-white undergraduate enrollment has increased 24.4%. Recruitment strategies that support this work include:

Multicultural Outreach Student Team (MOST) engages current students in the university’s minority recruitment efforts. Members share their positive experiences at Carolina while gaining leadership experience in assisting the university. There are approximately 40 active members who participate in recruitment and outreach activities including Taking Carolina Home, Note Writing and Calling Campaigns, and Student Panels.

Gender Neutral Housing
While gender neutral halls and specific rooms are not identified in our housing communities, we offer a number of private rooms in suites and several one-bedroom apartments to help students in transition to feel comfortable in their campus residence.

Gender Neutral Bathrooms
Most residence halls, particularly newer and recently renovated buildings, have gender neutral bathrooms in public spaces. For instance:

South Tower now has 19 private, gender-neutral bathrooms
Patterson Hall has 9 gender-neutral bathrooms
In all of housing facilities, there are 63 gender-neutral bathrooms

Student Health Services has certain providers (physicians, nurses, counselors, etc.) who have professional expertise in transgender concerns and they provide leadership regarding sensitive care for transitioning students. There is a care-team manager who has set up a mentoring program for students in gender transitioning decisions. We also refer interested students to a group called “Openings” at the Harriet Hancock Center for LGBTQ.

Mental health and suicide prevention programming includes prevention and early intervention strategies specific to the LGBTQ community.  The suicide prevention program includes specific information about LGBTQ issues.

Gender Identity as a Title IX Protected Class
The US Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued a “Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence” which contains the following statement: “Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity and OCR accepts such complaints for investigation. Similarly, the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of the parties does not change a school’s obligations [to investigate and resolve allegations].”

USC Policy STAF 1.08, “Sexual Assault” and USC Policy STAF 1.09, “Relationship Violence Stalking and Harassment” both contain statements that read as follows: “This policy applies to all members of the university community regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.”

The Counseling Center
Currently 10 counseling center visits are allotted to each student. On average, students use four visits in the fall and three visits in the spring. However, students can request additional visits. Emergency appointments are made based on need.

We will be seeking Faculty Senate approval and anticipate offering the new pathway in the fall semester of 2016.

More Inclusive Homecoming
To improve the sense of inclusion reflected in homecoming activities, the process for selecting the Homecoming Executive Commission that is charged with planning and executing homecoming week activities (with the advise and assistance of the Homecoming Commission) was significantly revised. In the past, the Executive Commission has been generally comprised of past Homecoming Commission members or students who were chosen by the out-going Executive Commission. The new process yielded an 11 member Executive Commission that has the following composition:

10 Female, 1 Male
5 White, 6 Non-White
6 Greek, 5 Non-Greek

Good to hear from you.

I think CUTR could tell you about policies to reduce emissions from mobile sources.  I'd start with asking Julie Bond or Sara Hendricks  Also, there was an air emissions inventory done a few years back for USF for some sort of sustainability certification. It was led out of ESP by Bob Brinkmann and his students.  I provided some expertise, but it was a while ago and I don't really remember much about it.  If you contact Bob, maybe he can lead you to the contact for whatever records there are.  (He is now at Hofstra University, so you'll need to use the web to get his contact info).  Connie Mizak in ESP also teaches about air quality some, so maybe she will have the information?

Doing this inventory looks like it could be a good student course project for my air pollution class for a future year.  Where can I find more information?

A STRATEGIC APPROACH
In accommodating the physical growth and redevelopment that are essential to fulfilling the University’s academic mission, the Plan views the Grounds as an integrated, contiguous series of multi-functional facilities and green spaces linked by a network of natural and man-made systems. Viewing these systems in a holistic relationship will yield more efficient use of available resources, and create a richer, more dynamic environment on Grounds. To accomplish these goals at the scale of the University requires a strategic approach, based on five primary principles reviewed in 2006 and adopted in 2008 by the Board of Visitors. Linking these principles is the overarching concept of sustainability, which asserts that growth and change can be accommodated while resources are conserved for future generations.
•Environmental Quality: to protect and restore our natural environment
•Connectivity: to increase the quality and continuity of linkages throughout the Grounds
•Context: to promote beneficial physical relationships with the surrounding community
•Multi-disciplinary Collaboration: to develop mixed-use facilities in support of academic interaction and collaboration
•Preservation: to maintain and enhance the University’s cultural, building, and landscape resources

A conventional campus plan would focus on defining specific building sites for future growth. Instead, the 2008 Grounds Plan recommends the establishment of Redevelopment Zones, a unique approach to campus planning making use of tools that are normally applied to city and community planning. The Redevelopment Zones (see page 6) target future development to areas where mixed-used infill development and redevelopment of existing facilities will create the greatest possible benefits in accommodating the variety of spaces and uses that comprise the University now and in the future. These targeted zones also allow for the conservation of important green spaces that contribute to the health and identity of the University-at-large.

Please also refer to the development of the redevelopment zones and how they are managed regarding the objectives, strategies and timeframes within the Introduction to the Grounds Plan.

","Human Resources, Sustainability Office","Sustainability is a societal condition wherein people live quality lives, meeting their needs in ways that permit other people to do the same now and into the distant future. Sustainable communities are nurturing places where people prosper and cultures thrive; they maintain capital stocks including environmental services; they are characterized by a diversity of ideas, economic activities, and landscapes; and they seek social justice and equity, while maintaining freedom and opportunities for citizens.

The sustainability path involves the merging of the historically distinct and often conflicting goals of development and conservation, which requires that societies work to:

-create opportunities where people may realize their full potentials, find productive livelihoods, and prosper;
-protect and enhance human health and encourage wellness;
-restore and preserve nature's life-support systems and evolutionary potential;
-derive benefits from natural capital without diminishing stocks for future generations;
achieve social justice;
-design livable, resilient and secure communities.

The path to sustainability occurs through the process of establishing appropriate institutions, policies, strategies, and technologies in a just transition that moves society toward the proper state. 

Sustainability is also the emerging science that seeks to understand the issues at the interface between society and nature and to find solutions to the associated problems so that people may thrive into the distant future. Sustainability science employs transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary thinking in addressing the complex interactions between natural and human systems.

Green purchasing is the method wherein environmental and social considerations are taken into account with the price, availability and performance criteria that we use to make purchasing decisions. 

Environmentally-preferable products have a reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared to other products and companies that serve the same purpose. It is the preference of Vanderbilt University that our suppliers use environmentally-preferable products, materials, and sources wherever economically feasible. If two products are competitive in performance characteristics and pricing, the university will favor the more environmentally-preferable product or company. 

The university and the supplier may negotiate during the contract term to permit the substitution or addition of environmentally-preferable products when such products are readily available at a competitive cost and satisfy the university’s performance needs. If a supplier is citing environmentally preferable product claims, the supplier must be able to provide proper certification or detailed information on environmental benefits, durability and recyclable properties. 

Procurement Services has worked closely with the university’s preferred office products, janitorial products, and laboratory products suppliers to provide more easily identified environmentally-preferable product selections. These products are readily identifiable in eProcurement and have been collected into special “green purchasing” catalogs that anyone can request.
A basic screen for environmentally-preferable products is to look for those that are reusable instead of disposable, recyclable, made with renewable energy, and contain a significant percentage of post-consumer waste recycled content. Additionally, third-party certification systems that indicate an environmentally-preferable product include: 
1. “Energy Star”: indicates a product has met strict energy efficiency guidelines as set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy (DOE). 
2. “EPEAT”: indicates electronics that are environmentally-preferable as determined by the EPA and Green Electronics Council. 
3. “FSC-Certified”: indicates products that have met the requirements of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for responsible management of forest resources, such as office paper. 
4. “SCS Recycled Content”: indicates a product that has been certified for recycled content and meets the stringent EPS standard for providing a measurable and significant environmental benefit over typical products in the same category. 
5. “CRI Green Label”: Product certified by the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) to improve indoor air quality. 
6. EPA Design for the Environment (DfE): EPA has screened each ingredient for potential human health and environmental effects and that-based on currently available information, EPA predictive models, and expert judgment-the product contains only those ingredients that pose the least concern among chemicals in their class. 
7. “Green Seal certified”: Products certified by Green Seal to meet environmentally-responsible design, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation requirements.

Defining sustainability as a focus on “natural systems and social systems as they relate to the environment” in applied or conceptual ways, courses aim to address the limits and dynamics of earth systems, inter- and intra-generational environmental and social vulnerabilities, and social, cultural, and historical contexts that shape how we think about environmental problems and solutions.

There is great value in an education that incorporates themes of sustainability. As an educational institution, we must take responsibility in shaping the future generations of leaders and decision makers who must deal with the full range of sustainability challenges, from global climate change to resource depletion to agricultural production. Furthermore, changing the behaviors and attitudes of each individual can have long-lasting impacts on the environment and climate change. 

There are many groups at Wellesley who aim to foster a culture that values sustainability as an important facet of daily life. The Greenhouse is incorporated into the curriculum through horticulture classes, but goes even further to engage with students and community members. The Greenhouse hires student Botanista Interns who lead informational lectures and host events to promote plant education.

The college believes that addressing climate change is a social and moral imperative that intersects with issues that are of pressing concern to the Wellesley College community, including issues of international equity, international governance, human rights, environmental protection, and economic development.  Wellesley has long educated its students to be leaders on such issues.

Resources","The Wellesley College campus includes buildings both old and new, many of architectural and iconic importance to all who live and work on campus as well as alumnae and campus visitors. The Wellesley 2025 report underscores that “a deep and nuanced understanding of the College’s buildings – individually and as an ensemble – and preservation of their most significant qualities are necessary precursors to additions and renovations that engage in meaningful ways with the existing campus.” 

The College’s commitment to sustainable buildings has grown over almost two decades of planning for “additions and renovations.” Sustainability as a value has figured in four important  “snapshots” of the campus. In the 1998 Landscape Master Plan, attention was drawn implicitly to sustainability challenges at the college: “the nearly built-out condition of the campus makes expansion and growth difficult,” “the decline of infrastructure,” and “the ageing of historical, architectural and site structures” (Foreward).  In the Wellesley College Comprehensive Facilities Plan of 2007, sustainability is one of its  “13 Framework Principles”: “Capital Planning for future alterations or expansion at Wellesley will address sustainability, with an emphasis on ecological, cost-effective, and low-maintenance capabilities.” In 2013, Wellesley 2025 declared that the college “has made significant progress towards its environmental goals, and has recently reformulated its sustainability committee” (Sustainability: Overview). The Advisory Committee on Sustainability, that reformulated committee, outlined sustainability goals in new construction and large renovations in the Wellesley College Green Building Standards, adopted by the college in 2014. ",True,True,"1. Improve means to measure, report and communicate energy consumption at a building/unit level and have data available in a central system consistently monitored for timely and effective troubleshooting. “Know what we have” 

2. Address deferred maintenance backlog in a plan that prioritizes “catching up” on repairs, moves then to “keeping up” building systems and infrastructure, and finally engages in “stewardship” by thinking proactively about future repairs.  

3. Improve physical infrastructure to conserve energy. 

4. Mandate energy saving measures in buildings such as set-point temperatures and restricted use of buildings over low-need periods. 

5. Engage building occupants in the sustainable use of buildings systems and implement programs to change behavior ","Sustainability Office

Facilities Management",True,True,"The purchasing, preparation, consumption, and disposal of food has an effect on the environment, the health of students, and the economic strength of the College. Therefore, food is inherently tied to the College’s commitment to sustainability. The College’s sourcing of foods impacts environmental issues, such as climate change, biodiversity, toxicity, and animal welfare; the transportation and preparation of foods impacts energy and water consumption; and the disposal of food contributes to economic and physical waste.  The Committee therefore aims to identify and execute ways to minimize the College’s impact on these issues and implement methods that will be both environmentally and economically sustainable.

The Committee’s ultimate vision for sustainable dining foresees purchasing foods that are in-season from local or regional farms that minimize pesticide use or from sustainable fisheries, serving healthy and nutritious meals that have low energy and water footprints, and producing little to no food and non-food waste.

Wellesley College has contracted with AVI, locally known as Wellesley Fresh to conduct most of its dining services. With the exception of the College Club, Wellesley Fresh handles all aspects of dining at Wellesley. Wellesley Fresh has already begun addressing the sustainability of its practices and is open to implementing more sustainable practices in the future.","1.

The college controls Zone 1, the immediate area around the wellheads Botany Wells #1 and #2 (2014 Drinking Water report); but not Zone 2, which is controlled by the Town of Wellesley. In the past, it has been assumed that WC doesn’t have to worry about water, that because it has its own wells, it is “free” (ES 300 2010). However, the Department of Environmental Protection controls how much water the college is able to withdraw from its wells.  The withdrawal permit includes permit conditions; especially relevant to our sector are the water conservation conditions. See “Amendment to Water Management Permit 2012” (when the latest permit issued) (Paul to Patrick to CWS coming shortly).

It's you. It's me. It's every one of us. We all have the ability to make  a difference in the world: everything you do, every day, matters. Here at Wellesley we act on that principle. It is who we are. Together we are Wellesley Sustainability.

Sustainability is much bigger than Wellesley College.

Sustainability is constantly evolving and has over five hundred different definitions. One of the more common definitions is “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”

Sustainability is more than “being green.” It is also demonstrating social, financial and local/global responsibility through a renewed concern for the environment and an institutional commitment to make a difference. At Wellesley College, it is our collective effort that can build a sustainable community. We believe these four principles succinctly define sustainability:


1. Sustainability revolves around humans and their environment – we recognize that health and happiness are at the core of a sustainable community, and that our actions to protect air, water, and natural resources are necessary to protect our wellbeing.

2. Sustainability recognizes the larger system – all things are interconnected and work together; seeing how a change to one thing influences another is essential for understanding the impact of our decisions.

3. Sustainability focuses on the elimination of wastes – there is no value or benefit when wasting energy, water, natural resources, money, time, or human capital.

4. Sustainability focuses on the future – change is inevitable, happens quickly, and is often unpredictable.  It is essential to make thoughtful decisions today that will make us more likely to succeed in the future.

When applied to design and construction of facilities and landscapes, this translates into the allocation and application of resources such that energy consumption is minimized, construction and demolition wastes are recycled to the greatest extent possible, landscaping uses native species, and stormwater runoff is captured and treated before entering the watershed. A healthy indoor environment is produced, by employing such strategies as natural daylighting, low off-gassing materials, and fresh air regulators, materials, finishes, and equipment, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems are chosen with total Life Cycle Costs taken into considerations, and not just the initial cost of purchase and installation.",True,True,http://cf.wmich.edu/campusfacilities/Green/,Facilities Management,True,--,"Dining Services participates in the WMU sustainability initiative to reduce waste, conserve vital resources, and protect the campus environment.

Based on food waste audits conducted in 2008, food waste was reduced by up to 30% when trays were removed. In addition to reducing food waste, there are also environmental savings that result from the decreased dish washing volume when trays are no longer used. Fewer cleaning chemicals are used, less energy is consumed to run dish machines, and their is less water waste. WMU students are applauded for their leadership in the national move to trayless dining and their immediate acceptance of this service style.

Western State College of Colorado
September 2009

Introduction 
As expressed in its institutional mission, Western State College of Colorado graduates “citizens prepared to assume constructive roles in local, national, and global communities.” In June of 2007, in an action consistent with Western’s mission, President Jay Helman signed the President’s Climate Commitment (PCC). The PCC commits Western to becoming a “carbon neutral” campus. Inspired by Western students who encouraged signing of the PCC, this commitment challenges Western to examine how citizens “assume constructive roles” in the context of climate change. In signing the PCC, the President recognized that our “local” choices in powering and educating our campus community obligate us to “global communities” facing the consequences of our carbon emissions.
At Western, a college high in the Rocky Mountains, our obligation to the climate crisis is elevated for regionally unique reasons. Gunnison’s cold weather and remote location currently create the demand for unsustainable levels of fossil fuels to heat homes and transport food, staples and luxuries. Climate change could hinder this region’s distinctive mountain economy. Colorado College’s 2006 State of the Rockies Report Card predicts that, if carbon emissions are not reduced dramatically, Gunnison County could lose 43 percent of its snowpack this century. Gunnison offers unique opportunities for potential climate solutions with renewable energy resources of sun, biomass and wind. And finally, faculty and community expertise on energy efficiencies and student enthusiasm for implementing local and global solutions emerge from this exceptional place.  
Western’s 2004-2009 Academic Strategic Plan recognizes the importance of the College being “a leader in resource efficiency” and its role in exemplifying and providing solutions for the “often competing forces of economic development and environmental stewardship.” As a regional educational provider, Western can model the importance of generating financial savings from natural resource savings.  Furthermore, the PCC promises to spark interdisciplinary, hands-on learning opportunities for students and pedagogical innovation for faculty. 
An ad hoc President’s Climate Committee was formed in July of 2007 and charged with three tasks: recommend two tangible actions from the Presidents’ Climate Commitment to the cabinet for possible implementation by 2009; conduct a baseline survey of Western’s greenhouse gas emissions; and develop a draft PCC Action Plan for cabinet and campus community consideration. Committee membership included three faculty, two students, the director of residence life, associate vice presidents of academic affairs and student affairs, the facilities operation manager, and the campus controller. The Committee completed its work in January 2009 when it submitted a draft PCC Action Plan to the president.
During the spring of 2009, the College’s newly formed Sustainability Action Committee (SAC) sought broader campus input on the draft Action Plan and then prepared recommendations for the cabinet.  
This Action Plan includes a survey of greenhouse gas emissions from 1998 through 2007, possible mitigation and educational strategies to achieve carbon neutrality by an ambitious and realistic timeline, and a financial analysis of the costs and benefits of different mitigation strategies. This plan is consistent with Western’s Environmental Charter, 2004-2009 Academic Strategic Plan, and role and mission.

Timeline and goals
The goal of carbon neutrality is an ambitious one for Western. For the purpose of Western’s plan, carbon neutrality is defined as having reduced or offset all direct and indirect emissions generated by electricity and natural gas use by the College’s physical plant and combustion of fossil fuels by institution-owned/controlled vehicles. During the first five years of the plan, we will create an institutional structure to implement education and mitigation principles, measure our progress toward reducing CO2 emissions, and we will adapt our plan as new technologies and opportunities avail themselves. Our targets are a reduction of 20 percent from campus 2006 CO2 emissions by 2020, a 50 percent reduction by 2035, and carbon neutrality by 2050. Our baseline data suggest that without action, we will continue to release more than 11,000 tons of carbon each year. Realistic progress will only be achieved through the creation of a campus culture that values the endeavor and through commitment to education and mitigation principles underlying a successful transformation. 

Campus emissions

 A requisite first step toward carbon neutrality is developing a baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. The PCC encourages campuses to use a tool called the Clean Air Cool Planet Campus Carbon Calculator, which is consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) used internationally by businesses and governments to set baseline calculations for their endeavors. Signatories of the commitment are expected to provide baseline data for GHG emissions from direct emissions generated by electricity and natural gas use by the institution and mobile combustion of fossil fuels by institution-owned/controlled vehicles. Additional data for indirect sources of emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the institution, but not sources owned or controlled by the institution, are encouraged where possible (e.g., food transport, air travel, etc.). While only one year of baseline data is required, the College has created a baseline inventory from 1998 through 2006. Such a baseline allows comparison of Western’s emissions prior to a major change in 1999 to our boiler systems, which use natural gas to heat buildings and water on the campus. Data on actual electricity and natural gas use were gathered for each of the eight years while information on travel emissions was collected for 2006 only and projected to be similar through the period of our survey.  
Our baseline clearly illustrates that the most significant contributors toward Western’s greenhouse gas emissions are electricity and natural gas use. Natural gas and electricity account for more than 99 percent of our emissions and over 11,000 tons of CO2 released each year (see figures). The number one priority for Western is to create mitigation measures which reduce or replace electricity and natural gas use in our buildings. 
We examined our overall energy use on campus from 1998-2006. Our use of natural gas has declined with our boiler renovations while electricity use has increased by an average of 3% per year. Projections of future CO2 emissions suggest that we may produce between 11,000 (0% increase) and 35,000 (2.5% annual increase) tons of CO2 per year without mitigation measures.   
Critical to successful reduction of CO2 emissions is our commitment to implement mitigation and education principles targeted at increasing our efficiency and decreasing our dependence on electricity and natural gas in our buildings.  
 



Mitigation Principles

Western State College of Colorado is committed to reducing the use of energy and resources associated with greenhouse gas emissions through conservation and efficiency activities and exploring alternative sources for our energy needs.  We recognize that a major source of energy use at our institution involves our buildings.  As such, we are committed to applying environmental stewardship principles to emphasize energy conservation and efficiency in building renovations and new facilities.

•	Reducing carbon emissions associated with electricity and natural gas use will have fiscal benefits given rising energy costs. At Western, we project that our energy budget will increase by greater than $1,000,000 (see Financing section on page 4) within the next 15 years without increased efficiency and energy conservation measures. During the next 5 years, the College will incorporate into the engineering of all renovation and new construction projects measures that will lower our emissions and generate a projected savings in budgeted utility costs. To the extent possible, new initiatives supporting the reduction of energy use shall be funded through multi-year savings from programs that promote reduced energy use and increased energy efficiency in current practices.  

•	Simultaneously, it is important to also realize the educational value in symbolic acts—those that may not realize direct financial benefits—in fostering cultural change.

•	Successful reduction of carbon emissions requires active and regular monitoring of energy use related to emissions. In order to achieve this goal, we will improve equipment and monitoring capacities and create an organizational structure (see Implementation and Tracking section on page 6) that encourages active and regular monitoring of energy use and carbon uptake on the Western campus. Individuals within the organization will synthesize, analyze, and update energy use and carbon emission data and provide recommendations to the cabinet for Western’s next steps towards carbon neutrality.

•	Where possible, we will work to ensure that campus units or groups using energy can be assessed for their usage and rewarded for their energy and financial savings.  

•	We will explore, advocate, and purchase regionally appropriate and fiscally feasible alternative energy sources as they become available. 

•	Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 may require expenditure of funds to purchase carbon offsets. However, we believe that direct carbon reduction activities, which are fiscally more responsible than offsets and are important for nurturing a campus and community culture of energy conservation and efficiency, should be our first focus. If we do engage in future offset projects, we encourage developing relationships that allow our students opportunities to engage in education, research, and monitoring in ecosystems in which our carbon offsets are implemented.

An example scenario demonstrating these principles can be found in the Appendix.  Envisioned is that these types of  “low hanging fruit” will be investigated and implemented during the first 5 years of Western’s plan. In addition to beginning these first steps, implementation of the educational and community outreach principles below is critical to the success of the mitigation measures necessary to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  

Educational and Community Outreach Principles

Western State College of Colorado is committed to cultivating a living and learning culture by demonstrating and providing choices for practicing a sustainable lifestyle. The educational vision will be accomplished through student empowerment, learning opportunities, community outreach, infrastructure, and campus communications.  

•	Student Empowerment: Western will encourage and facilitate the civic engagement of students through service, educational, and outreach efforts that promote sustainable practices within the College community.

•	Learning Opportunities: Western will provide students, staff, and faculty with learning options to deliver sustainability education and promote ecological awareness.

•	Community Outreach: Western will provide a campus model of sustainability and convene public environmental events that inspire and assist others in achieving carbon neutrality.

•	Infrastructure: Western will utilize the architecture and physical infrastructure of the campus (academic and residence buildings and our inter-building spaces) to assist with the facilitation of sustainability education and cultural change.

•	Communication: The College's pledge to the President's Climate Commitment will be explicit in official internal and external College communications. Progress toward our goals will be publicly available.

These educational and community outreach principles are key to the change in culture needed for Western to fulfill its commitment to carbon neutrality.  

Financing

College facilities managers acknowledge that investments in improving energy efficiency of aging building systems are often cost effective and offer attractive rates of return. However, they may be unable or at least reluctant to implement energy saving measures because of a lack of adequate funds to support the needed capital improvements. Even if capital investments can be recovered quickly from projected savings in energy costs, it is often difficult to borrow against such future operating cost savings to finance such investments.  
Additional financial roadblocks to energy efficiency investments may result from the separation between building occupants and those paying the energy cost. Most occupants of educational facilities are not aware of energy use and do not pay energy bills.
Despite the challenges and roadblocks mentioned above, it is imperative that we seek fiscal solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs. Unless mitigation efforts are undertaken, the College can expect a minimum of 97% increase in utility costs by 2020 over 2007 costs resulting in a projected increase of over $1,000,000 additional dollars per year being spent on utilities. This projection was calculated using a rolling average to project estimated energy costs through year 2020. The average increase in unit costs from years 1998 through 2007 was added to year 2007 energy costs to estimate year 2008 costs. Each subsequent year was calculated in the same way resulting in the graphical estimate in the figure to the right.   
Western will explore establishing a capital fund for energy-saving and emission reduction projects and/or a revolving fund for such projects to help finance the capital costs of efficiency improvements.
An imperative step in the institution’s progress toward carbon neutrality is to monitor energy usage for each building. While our ability to monitor natural gas at a building level is possible, we cannot currently measure residence halls or building use of electricity. The mitigation principles include the importance of individual units or groups using energy to be assessed for their usage or rewarded for their savings. Smith, Seckman and Reid, an electrical engineering firm, estimated in 2008 the cost of installing individual electric meters in each campus building to be $86,000. The current and planned renovation projects on campus provide an opportunity to include these meters as part of the project and thus further reduce the cost of equipping the remaining buildings.   
In addition to the above, being able to monitor energy usage within buildings is a necessary first step to entering into a performance contract.  Energy service companies (ESCos) implement energy efficiency improvements on a performance-contracting basis, facilitate financing and guarantee financial savings against a projected utility cost model. Performance contracting is an alternative financing strategy that allows educational facilities to finance energy-efficiency projects. Performance contracting uses projected energy savings from installed efficiency measures to pay for the project, including energy-saving equipment, installation, and maintenance services. The distinguishing characteristics of an energy performance contract include:

•	Only one contractor is made accountable for design, purchase, installation, maintenance, operation of the equipment and any necessary training.

•	The contractor may provide services that facilitate College financing to implement energy conservation measures.

•	Payments by the College to the energy service contractor are made after project completion and the amount is contingent upon savings achieved against a projected utility cost model.

•	The contractor assumes the technical risk of energy savings performance.

•	Energy-efficiency specialists can select state-of-the-art energy-efficiency technologies.

In 1996, Western entered into a performance contract to install individual boilers in each of its auxiliary buildings and provide energy-saving lighting retrofits in all buildings. The predicted average annual energy savings were $296,825, maintenance savings averaged $206,350 and the net annual savings after lease payments were factored in were projected to be $22,268. The contract guaranteed annual energy savings of 772,576 CCF of natural gas and 2,102,002 KWH of electricity. Critical to our future success is exploring new energy performance contracts.
Smaller steps also need to be taken and some can be implemented quickly. A $500,000 revolving fund could provide funding for various energy-saving measures which would “pay back” the fund through cost savings. Along with the energy efficiency fund, we will seek endowed gifts and grants for sustainability initiatives to help reduce overall general fund energy expenditures. Grants will be explored annually by the Office of Sponsored Programs.  
 

Implementation structure for tracking progress and updating 

Western’s Sustainability Action Committee (SAC) serves to implement, assess, and modify the Environmental Charter, the President’s Climate Commitment, and future campus sustainability initiatives. Membership of the committee includes the vice presidents for student affairs, finance and administration, and academic affairs or their respective designees; a representative appointed from the faculty senate; a representative appointed from the chairs and directors; a student appointed by SGA, a student appointed by the Western Sustainability Coalition, the director of facilities, and any sustainability coordinator(s) as might be appointed by the president. Annually, a member of the committee is appointed chair by the president. The SAC annually researches best practices from other higher education institutions and private sector organizations committed to carbon neutrality. The committee synthesizes, analyzes, and updates data and proposes new goals and recommendations to the cabinet and campus community as appropriate, but no less often than every five years. The committee is responsible for coordinating sustainability projects and collaborating with students, faculty, and staff. 



 

Appendix
	Case Study 
Residence Halls—from a drain on resources to a showcase for living and learning

The following case study provides an illustration of how the guiding principles are used to achieve carbon emission reduction goals. In this example, we focus on a 20% reduction by 2020 in one residence hall complex. The guiding principles are shown in bold italics.
As outlined below, student-driven research and other learning opportunities can provide the necessary baseline information and ongoing monitoring to inform and direct cost-effective actions to reach carbon reduction goals. These actions are based on the commitment to energy efficiency and conservation that will provide energy savings to fund larger projects in the years to come. If the institution also has the ability to accurately monitor electrical and gas use, we can provide incentive-based opportunities for group units (e.g., residence halls) to lower energy usage. Such strategies have proven highly effective at other campuses, resulting in significant CO2 reductions and associated cost savings.

Western State College of Colorado is committed to cultivating a living and learning culture by demonstrating and providing choices for practicing a sustainable lifestyle. The educational vision will be accomplished through student empowerment, learning opportunities, community outreach, infrastructure, and campus communications.
  
Student Empowerment: Western will encourage and facilitate the civic engagement of students through service, educational, and outreach efforts that promote sustainable practices within the College community.

Learning Opportunities: Western will provide students, staff, and faculty with learning options to deliver sustainability education and promote ecological awareness.

Student empowerment and integrating course work with the climate commitment have already provided important baseline information. Based on the campus inventory of carbon emissions, greater than 95% of the College’s emissions come from building heating (41%) and electricity (58%). Student research (e.g., freshman Environmental Biology courses, upper-level ENVS courses, and independent projects) has further shown that residence halls are contributing over 80% of total campus emissions related to heating, with per-square-foot, -heating-related emissions more than two times that of other buildings (Figure 1). For example, student monitoring of campus natural gas use in the fall of 2007 calculated 813 tons of monthly carbon emitted from campus buildings with over 650 tons coming just from residence halls. Complexes like Mears (184 tons/month) and Shavano (169 tons/month), combined, were contributing greater than 20% of the total campus carbon emissions related to natural gas use.

 
Figure 1. Average monthly carbon emissions related to heating per square foot for campus buildings in fall 2007. Kelley Hall was under renovation during this period, and the building data are excluded from this comparison (ENVS 301 project – Kissel, et al.).


At Western, we are committed to applying environmental stewardship principles to emphasize energy conservation and efficiency in building renovations and new facilities.

Successful reduction of carbon emissions requires active and regular monitoring of energy use related to emissions.

The guiding principle of emphasizing energy efficiency and conservation is an important starting point for most reduction strategies. For Mears complex, which annually emits 1,546 tons of carbon from natural gas heating and lighting, achieving a 20% reduction by 2020 would mean reducing annual carbon emissions by 309 tons. This goal can be achieved by simple energy efficiency and conservation actions which are intertwined with student research and monitoring, as well as changes in student behavior through incentive and education programs. Follow-up student research in Mears complex suggests that windows may account for 25% of heating losses, and common areas may account for 60% of electricity used for lighting. A 75% reduction in electricity usage (through both conservation and efficiency actions) can be achieved over a six to eight-year period by reducing the number of lights in use by a quarter, the wattage of lights in use by a quarter (e.g., from 32 watt to 24 watt), and by reducing the amount of time lights are on (through motion detectors and changes in student and staff behavior). These actions would equate to a reduction in carbon emissions of 52 tons in six to eight years and a total savings of $25,000 (based on a 4% annual increase in electric prices).  Simultaneous with the electrical reduction, a conservation action--such as resetting and reprogramming the thermostats in the complex to a three-degree difference--could reduce annual natural gas emissions by as much as 15% or 222 tons.







Reducing carbon emissions associated with electricity and natural gas use will have fiscal benefits given rising energy costs.

Given rising energy costs, reducing carbon emissions associated with electricity and natural gas use will have fiscal benefits. In this example, the energy savings resulting from electrical and natural gas reductions could fund replacement of single-paned, inefficient windows with energy-efficient, double-paned windows. Window upgrades of this sort can reduce natural gas use by 25% or 314 tons. In Mears complex, this action could reduce its total emissions by 588 tons or 38% by 2020, well above the 20% goal. 

We will explore, advocate, and purchase regionally appropriate and fiscally feasible alternative energy sources as they become available. 

Campus-wide energy savings can help fund replacement of fossil fuels with alternative energy sources. If the guiding principles of emphasizing energy efficiency and conservation—in tandem with incentive-based reductions—were applied to all residence halls, total annual carbon reductions from residence halls could be as much as 2,940 tons or 26% of the campus total. These changes could result in energy savings of about $350,000 annually (calculated without annual energy-price increases). Such savings could be used to fund larger renovations, incorporating passive solar and alternative energy technologies like solar and wind. By 2035, additional improvements and renovations could result in our achieving 50% reductions in emissions.  Such additional reductions could result from LEED Gold or similar renovations, resulting in an additional 40% reduction in energy use.

Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 will likely require expenditure of funds to purchase carbon offsets.   

We believe that direct carbon-reduction activities--which are fiscally more responsible than carbon offsets and are important for nurturing a campus and community culture of energy conservation and efficiency--are our first priority.  However, our final goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 will likely occur with either offsets or significant changes in the availability of renewable resources.  If we do engage in future offset projects, we encourage the development of relationships that allow our students opportunities to engage in education, research, and monitoring of ecosystems in which our carbon offsets are implemented.

Conclusion

Through simple, cost-effective strategies, we can significantly reduce campus carbon emissions. In addition, residence halls like Mears and Shavano could transition from a drain in energy resources to living and learning laboratories that showcase Western’s commitments to environmental stewardship, active student involvement and learning in daily lives, and providing leadership for the community at large.

Sustainability Product Analysis: 
Six points to YES

If a food product qualifies with two “yes” answers under one of the following six points, it is of interest to Williams Dining in the effort to improve the sustainability of food served at Williams College.

1) Is this product grown or raised within 150 miles (Real Food Criteria) or 250 miles (current Williams Dining criteria) of Williamstown, MA?

2) Is the producer a small-scale independent farmer, or cooperatively owned?

3) Is the product certified organic or in a reliably certified transitional phase?

4) If this is an animal product, is the animal pasture-raised?

5) Does the producer meet all applicable federal and state labor regulations for non-exempt workers at the original source point?

6) List all the sustainability certification programs that the product is certified by (Fair Trade, etc.). If one or more can be named, this is a positive point. Claims will be furthered reviewed by Williams Dining.

Williams has a zero loan policy for students from families with incomes below $75,000 which enables low-income students to graduate with little if any student loan debt.  Though our maximum loan debt is $16,000 after four years, many students are eligible for a reduced loan expectation if their parent contribution is below $20,000.  Further, students with parent contributions below $4,000 are eligible for a Health Insurance Grant to cover the cost of state mandated health insurance coverage and lower student summer savings expectations - and all students eligible for aid receive a book grant to cover the full cost of required texts and course reading packets thereby exempting them from any out-of-pocket costs for reading materials.","Financial Aid

Williams is committed to protecting and enhancing the natural and built environment in which we learn, work, and live, and to supporting the global effort to advance environmental sustainability. These efforts rely on the involvement of all members of the campus community. To succeed, initiatives must be not only environmentally responsible but also socially fair and economically sound.

The College’s greatest contribution is through educating our students, who will go on to become environmental stewards through their many roles as scientists, lawyers, investors, politicians, manufacturers, writers, advocates, artists, teachers, parents, consumers, and citizens. We do this through our teaching, research, and co-curricular offerings, and by demonstrating and embracing sustainable practices in the development and operations of our campus.

As faculty, staff, and students, we educate ourselves about important issues related to sustainability and pass on our learning to the larger communities of which we are all part. We eagerly share ideas with and learn from our neighbors and colleagues and seek consortial arrangements that can develop and broaden such practices. We work to contribute to the development of environmental standards. We report regularly on our progress.

In addition to adhering to all environmental laws and regulations, Williams focuses on the following sustainability issues.

Energy and Emissions:
We reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by increasing energy efficiency and selecting cleaner and renewable energy sources. We reduce energy use by constructing only the facilities we need and by building, renovating, maintaining, and operating them to use energy efficiently throughout their life. As campus community members, we seek to reduce energy use in our daily lives, in our work, and in our travel and to be mindful of the impacts of our choices.

Natural Resources:
We reduce our effects on water systems by minimizing use and by managing storm-water runoff. When materials are required, we select sustainably harvested sources to preserve natural resources. We protect the local habitat by limiting the physical growth of the college. We work to develop built landscapes in ways that support natural ecological functions by protecting existing ecosystems and regenerating ecological capacity where it has been lost. We provide opportunities for members of the community to interact with and appreciate the environment.

Procurement, Consumption, and Waste:
We reduce, reuse, and recycle materials. We work to understand and decrease the environmental impacts of the use, production, transportation and disposal of items we purchase. We select vendors committed to sustainable practices throughout the life cycle of their products, and we prefer to buy locally.

Quality of the Built Environment:
We build and maintain buildings that provide safe, comfortable and healthy environments for students, faculty and staff through effective use of day-lighting, ventilation, and connections with the natural environment. We work to improve our understanding of toxic materials used on campus and to reduce their presence in labs, art studios, and building and maintenance materials as well as in cleaning, landscaping, and pest-control.
