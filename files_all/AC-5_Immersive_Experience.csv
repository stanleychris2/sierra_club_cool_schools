Albion College,2016-02-25,2016-02-25 15:19:08,mfrever@albion.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The major in sustainability studies at Albion College is a joint venture between Albion College and the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (UVSQ), in France.  Courses in the curriculum are categorized as theories, tools, and terrains. Theories include the framing concepts and scientific principles of sustainability studies, while tools are the methods of analysis and communication. Terrains are specific fields of sustainability challenges, using the theories and tools that students will have already mastered.
 
Through this integration students are invited to explore, on the one hand, the relationships between the economy, lifestyle, and politics and, on the other hand, the physical environment, natural resource use, pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss. In this way, the interdisciplinary and international character of the major in sustainability studies complements the disciplinary foundations of traditional degree programs.

After successfully completing the major in sustainability studies, and upon graduation from Albion College, students will receive the B.A. in sustainability studies from Albion College along with a certificate of sustainability studies from UVSQ. They will also be eligible to enter the second year master's program at UVSQ (taught in English) in sustainability studies.",http://www.albion.edu/academics/programs-of-distinction/center-for-sustainability-and-the-environment/majors-and-concentrations/sustainability-studies-major,"A revision of the Sustainability Studies Major is navigating our campus governance system.

One particular sustainability immersive experience is the opportunity to study at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies on Kibbutz Ketura in Israel.  Allegheny students live and study with Israeli, Palestinians, Egyptian, Jordanian and other global students to explore sustainability issues within the context of a region fraught with not only political and religious turmoil, but also a harsh desert environment with sensitive ecosystems and scarce resources, most particularly water.  Students learn in the classroom but also in their intense living situation about the complexities of political, cultural, and environmental issues.  In addition, students are immersed in an alternative living environment since the Institute is housed on a kibbutz, a unique agricultural collaborative community, which features car-sharing, solar thermal water heating, dual flush toilets, and a utility scale solar installation among other sustainability features.
An example of a sustainability focused Experiential Learning Seminar, is the month long  exploration of sustainable business practices and energy development in the northern European region. From eco-industrial parks in Denmark, to large-scale wind energy development in Germany these approaches have proven the potential to achieve environmental and economic objectives simultaneously. Students examine how these nations have made such tremendous progress in achieving sustainable economic development and whether these practices can be replicated in the United States.

Sustainability has been defined in many different ways and is often narrowly focused on either the persistence of an organization (and its financial viability) over time or on ensuring that natural resources are available into the future. However, in a holistic sense, the concept of sustainability must include an awareness of social justice and how it connects with the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability that are more commonly considered.

Their objective is to encourage students to think reflexively about the diverse world in which they live as they engage in collaborative work with local, transnational, and international communities. Mosaics provide opportunities for students to meaningfully apply what they are learning in the classroom, both theoretically and methodologically, to the world beyond – and to bring their experiences in the world back into the classroom. Dickinson Mosaics challenge students to ask significant and relevant questions of the people and communities with which they are working; to actively listen to what others say about their lives and realities; to reflect on their own lives, worlds, and perspectives; to design research that addresses the needs and interests of their partner communities; and finally to present what they have discovered in thoughtful, effective, and ethical ways to multiple audiences. 

In Fall 2014, Dickinson's Global Climate Change Mosaic offered students the opportunity to explore multiple dimensions of climate change as part of an interdisciplinary research team that will attend the 20th Conference of the Parties (COP20) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Lima, Peru.

Each summer, Dickinson offers a number of study abroad summer immersion programs, which often include one or more sustainability focused programs. Recent sustainability focused summer programs have gone to Cameroon, Tanzania, China, France, Germany, Israel, and Italy.",http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/603/mosaics,"The American and Global Mosaics are intensive, interdisciplinary, sustainability-focused, semester-long research programs designed around ethnographic fieldwork and immersion in domestic and global communities. Their objective is to encourage students to think reflexively about the diverse world in which they live as they engage in collaborative work with local, transnational, and international communities. The Mosaics provide opportunities for students to meaningfully apply what they are learning in the classroom, both theoretically and methodologically, to the world beyond – and to bring their experiences in the world back into the classroom. 

The Mosaics challenge students to ask significant and relevant questions of the people and communities with which they are working; to actively listen to what others say about their lives and realities; to reflect on their own lives, worlds, and perspectives; to design research that addresses the needs and interests of their partner communities; and finally to present what they have discovered in thoughtful, effective, and ethical ways to multiple audiences. Students learn not only how to design and conduct research but also how to produce their findings and analyses in various forms: written research papers and reports, conference presentations, video documentaries, audio podcasts, and multi-media websites.

Example: http://blogs.dickinson.edu/cop20/

The design of a specific Mosaic program is driven by pedagogical and research concerns and faculty interest and availability. A number of different models have emerged, including a full semester of coursework taken by students with 2-3 faculty from different disciplines, cluster courses, and a one credit course that integrates a winter term or a spring break research trip."
Drew University,2016-03-25,2016-03-25 16:12:50,swald@drew.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Drew students have multiple options for sustainability-focused immersive experiences.  The Environmental Studies and Sustainability (ESS) major itself requires an experiential component in which students gain hands-on experiences dealing with a variety of environmental issues.  

Students may undertake internships during the academic year and during the summer.  Students can participate in these internships for academic credit.  The ESS program provides small grants to support students who opt to do unpaid internships. Within the last few years, students have interned at places such as the NJ Audubon Society and the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.
 	In addition, many courses offered at Drew have an immersive sustainability component.  An example is seen in the Tropical Marine Ecology class, in which students do a week-long experience in the Caribbean, focusing on the intricate ecosystems and conservation issues of the area. Community-Based Learning classes in English, Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry and other departments take students into the community working on sustainability projects with non-profit partners. 

Drew also offers many Drew International Seminars (DIS), in which students spend approximately 3 weeks abroad.  Some of these programs have a sustainability focus. Drew's annual environmental justice alternative spring break also counts as such a program.

Duke University,2016-02-26,2016-02-26 14:18:17,tavey.mcdaniel@duke.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Duke offers students two sustainability-focused immersive experiences: civic engagement immersion through DukeEngage and study abroad programs.

DukeEngage, launched in 2007, empowers students to address critical human needs through immersive service (minimum of eight weeks). All student participants are fully funded, and since the program began more than 2800 Duke students have participated.

The civic engagement activities in each DukeEngage program involve at least one environmental, social, or economic dimension of sustainability, including environmental advocacy, community outreach, global health, education, and social justice. Multiple programs involve two or three dimensions. Programs with thematic areas in environmental advocacy and sustainability have been offered in the United States in Louisiana, North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington State, and internationally in Argentina, Ecuador, India, Jordan, Kenya, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and Uganda.

For example, DukeEngage Kenya-Kakamega is organized by the Foundation for Sustainable Development, which promotes collaboration with communities to enhance the capacity of individuals and organizations to address local health, social, environmental, and economic issues for long-term development. Students work with partner organizations on specific projects. Recent students have...
      *Designed rain water harvesting systems for local schools and trained schoolteachers to construct and maintain the systems, then conducted hygiene and health workshops with all students and faculty.
      *Trained youth groups in waste management theory and how to run a business through turning garbage into income generating materials such as compost and charcoal briquettes.

Since 2010, DukeEngage has supported students in the ""Managing Environmental Organizations"" program in Portland, Oregon. This program is the first DukeEngage program that systematically fosters a holistic marriage of service to the environment with a personal commitment to voluntary simplicity and sustainable living. Students assess their carbon footprints through a personal carbon calculator, which tracks participants’ behavior and monitors electricity usage, modes of transportation, and dietary decisions. The Portland program educates students on ways to reduce their carbon footprint through the use of public transportation; maintaining a vegetarian, locally focused, organic diet; and additional environmentally focused lifestyle choices. The group also participates in environmental projects in Portland on the weekends to collectively offset carbon that is not eliminated through behavioral changes, including beach cleanups, community gardens, and tree planting. 

Duke’s Study Abroad Office has approved several sustainability programs hosted by other organizations. The School for International Training (SIT) Study Abroad programs give students the opportunity to grapple with the complexities of critical issues such as global health, sustainable development, biodiversity, human rights, migration, and peacebuilding. Multiple programs engage with all three dimensions of sustainability. For example, major topics of study in the SIT program Peru: Indigenous Peoples & Globalization include ""Indigenous rights, advocacy, and policy; Community empowerment; Identity recognition; Historical legacies and contemporary social movements; Impacts of global changes: society, culture, economy, and ecology."" The program IHP/Comparative: Climate Change: The Politics of Food, Water, and Energy ""examines the interconnections between the economics, politics, geography, and science of climate change and its effects on human society.""

The School for Field Studies (SFS) sustainability-focused programs include Sustainable Development Studies in Costa Rica, where students ""examine management schemes, identify the benefits of protected areas, and determine which systems offer the best option for economic development, the maintenance of cultural norms, and the preservation of biodiversity.""

The DukeEngage Guatemala-Antigua program is organized by Social Entrepreneur Corps (SEC) in collaboration with DukeEngage. The program focuses on designing and implementing entrepreneurial and educational solutions with constituents in rural communities in the developing world. Student experiences are shaped by client needs, but students learn about social entrepreneurship, social innovation, and empowerment. Throughout the program, students engage with a multitude of rural communities, local organizations, small businesses and entrepreneurs. DukeEngage participants play a direct role in designing and developing innovative social entrepreneurial intervention based on local needs through their immersion and engagement with families, communities, organizations and entrepreneurs. This program deeply explores two aspects of sustainability - economics and society.

Emory University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 16:26:44,ciannat.howett@emory.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Emory University offers several venues for immersive, sustainability-focused, experiences.  Each of these programs includes a combination of in-class and off-campus activities to provide students both with training in the history and theory of sustainability as well as in the field experiences.  

1) Internships: Emory University offers undergraduate students the opportunity to receive academic credit for off-campus, unpaid, internships.  Through the College Internship Program students with placements at environmental or climate based organizations are encouraged to enroll in a sustainability focused reflection course.  In this course students are exposed to primary source readings in each of the areas of the triple bottom line of sustainability – environmental, economic, and social.  Since students have positions in varied locations – from the City of Atlanta’s Office of Sustainability to community garden organizations – the discussions are necessarily broad, but are intended to expose students to the social justice issues which are wrapped into the umbrella that is sustainability.  The course culminates with a digital story presentation where students identify, research, and present a specific sustainability issue - such as deconstruction of buildings versus demolition - discussed in class which they find to be particularly relevant to their internship.

2) Community Building and Social Change Program: Emory University’s Community Building and Social Change Fellowship program is a focused and intensive 12-month program.  Students apply to the program and a select group is offered the opportunity to augment their typical college courses with training and field work with one of a number of sustainable Atlanta community building initiatives.  Coursework in the Fall begins with the history and theories of community building and social change and goes on to examine the roles that corporate, government, and nonprofit sectors play in communities.  In the Spring fellows learn methods for community-based research, strategic planning, and community organizing which they then apply during the Summer by working on projects proposed by local community organizations addressing specific challenges related to health, housing and community development, the environment and climate, and social policy.  Current Community Building and Social Change fellows are working with the DeKalb Sustainable Neighborhoods Initiative to craft Quality of Life Plans in four high school clusters in DeKalb County, Georgia.

3) Freiburg Environmental Studies and Sustainability Study-Abroad Program: Emory University, in partnership with Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg, offers students a study-abroad opportunity focused on the eco-friendly industry which has developed in Freiburg, Germany.  Students can take courses in environmental studies, forest ecology, and sustainable innovation – many of which include outdoor research activities in the Black Forest and Rhine River Valley.  Courses are designed as three-week modules with an emphasis on hands-on study and experiences with ecological processes and human effects on the environment.  Included in the program is also a carbon-offset for the approximate round-trip air travel of each student.  

4) Undergraduate Program in Global Research and Development (UPGRADE): Emory's Center for International Programs Abroad administers an undergraduate grant for Emory College students who wish to gain practical hands-on sustainable development training by doing service in developing countries over the summer. This non-credit bearing program allows students to approach their time abroad from a different angle and focuses on students with a distinct set of skills and experiences. In-country supervision and training is done through the Foundation for Sustainable Development. 

5) The Ethics and Servant Leadership program (EASL): EASL offers students an opportunity to participate in summer internships, alternative Spring Break trips, and the Forum (an academic year program) while teaching students about service and community involvement. Many of these opportunities provide sustainability-focused immersive experiences, including placements at Emory's Office of Sustainability Initiatives, Decatur High School Community Garden, The Carter Center, Greening Youth Foundation, Park Pride, Trees Atlanta, Urban League, CARE, and Gaia Gardens.

6) Environmental Sciences Service-Learning course (ENVS 491): This program allows students to combine environmental concerns with the planning and implementation of community-based projects. The spring 2014 section of ENVS 491 focused on coal and its impact on people and the environment. Throughout the semester, students investigated the environmental, social, and economic impact of each phase of the lifespan of coal, including extraction, cleaning, transport, and burning. The course incorporated readings on case studies, documentary films, guest speakers, and involvement in Environment Georgia’s Solar Campaign (http://www.environmentgeorgia.org/). Throughout the semester, students planned and implemented two major projects in conjunction with Environment Georgia: a Solar Town Hall and Lobby Days.",http://oucp.emory.edu/our_work/engaged_learning/cbsc_index.html,"Data reported for 2013-2014 academic year.

MAY X Slow Food Italy
Slow Food Italy proposes to engage students in an extended, in-depth discussion about ways to promote and maintain healthy, environmentally responsible food production, procurement and preparation in modern society.  Readings will motivate discussion on current problems posed by industrial food production; solutions will be considered through the examples offered by traditional foodways as observed and experienced on an organic farm in Italy, where students will be in residence.  Activities may include working in the farm’s gardens, watching fresh cheese being made, hunting for truffles and other wild foods, visiting an organic winery, and preparing handmade pasta and other foods.  Short stays in Rome at the beginning and end of the program will give insights into Italians’ attitudes about eating and provide the experience of shopping for fresh foods in urban markets.
The course will introduce students to Slow Food, an international grass roots movement and cultural philosophy that was born out of a non-profit organization founded in Italy in 1986.  After a crash course on the economic, social, culinary and ecological underpinnings of the Slow Food mission, and an exploration of how the organization has evolved in the US context, the group will travel to Rome and then on to the town of Sora, in the Lazio region of Italy.  Here students will be in residence on an organic farm for two weeks to learn about the ideals espoused by the Slow Food movement both through readings and discussion and by experiencing traditional farming and gastronomy firsthand.  By closely observing traditional Italian foodways, they will learn about alternatives to industrial food production while debating the relative merits of American and Italian approaches to eating.  Students will reflect on the experience through a final paper and an oral presentation to be delivered at the end of the stay.

MAY X Farm
""After many years in which agricultural interest groups crafted agricultural policy with few contenders, grass-roots citizens are advocating for changes in US agriculture policy on environmental, animal welfare, and public health fronts.  The new actors in agricultural policy advocate for sustainable agriculture and argue for policies that favor local, organic foods.   Added to the mix are questions about farm subsidies, ethanol, and crop insurance.  This debate between sustainable and commodity agriculture has put the American farm at the center of a growing political controversy.  Farm brings students to Iowa, the leading corn, soy, egg, and hog producer in the nation.  The state also is home to a strong network of sustainable agriculture groups.  During Farm, students will speak to farmers employing a wide variety of agricultural practices.   If you are concerned about the future of food, there are few places better to learn about it than in Iowa.
Students in Farm will have the opportunity to plant corn and/or soybeans, learn about precision agriculture, work on an organic farm, shop at a Farmer’s Market, and visit farms and facilities that specialize in production animal agriculture..  All of these activities and experiences are to provide the students with insights into the impact of agriculture practices and to better understand how the current food system operates, its strengths and flaws.  By understanding the variety of agricultural practices employed in Iowa, students can better evaluate for themselves the claims being made in support of or against organic food, local food, animal welfare standards, nutrient management strategies, no-till farming, and crop """,https://studyaway.furman.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ListAll,--

Often, as with the minor in sustainability, the course listing is identified as ""Culminating Experience"" or ""Capstone Seminar.""  Following are some examples that demonstrate the breadth of activity on campus.  

As of Fall 2012, all undergraduate sustainability minors are required to complete an experiential learning component for the minor.  This three-credit academic requirement challenges students to take sustainability from the classroom to the community through community service, internships or directed research.  During the semester that the student is fulfilling this requirement the students must complete several reflection essays that allow them to think critically about the real-world connections with their community partners working toward sustainability.  Another requirement of this immersive experience is to complete a social media project by creating a blog, post or video.  This semester-long, immersive experience enhances the skills and knowledge of GW’s sustainability minors and acts as a “capstone” experience.

Graduate School of Education and Human Development (GSEHD) 
Community-Engaged Teaching (CET) at GW’s Graduate School of Education and Human Development is an innovative teacher education preparation that links academically rigorous, university-based teacher education programming with community and school-based fieldwork.  As part of this training, students in GSEHD participate in a service-learning project with Groundwork Anacostia River DC, an organization that fosters environmental restoration and sustainability in Washington, DC.  Students are required to translate their service-learning experience into curriculum for use in the content areas in which they teach; develop skills as community video storytellers and create short films that represent their vision of community-engaged teaching; investigate theories of social justice education that help them bridge the classroom to the broader community; and work with master teachers in a variety of secondary school settings as they experience the diverse landscape of schooling in Washington, DC.

School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
The GW Chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) currently consists of student members from the School of Engineering and Applied Science, but membership is open to all disciplines. The current project involves the sustainable design and implementation of compost latrines in the village of La Peña, El Salvador, as well as training of local villagers. The students have conducted a number of implementation trips to El Salvador. The next project is the evaluation of safe water sources for the village.   

School of Law
The Law School’s Environment and Energy Policy Practicum offers students the opportunity to work directly with client organizations on semester-long policy research projects.  These projects frequently have a sustainability focus with organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund, the World Resources Institute, the American Council on Renewable Energy, and the Solar Electric Industry Association of Virginia.

College of Professional Studies
The Graduate Certificate in Sustainable Landscapes features weekend residencies that alternate with online work. Students meet face-to-face for full weekends, several times per semester and spend that time in field and studio work.  Fieldwork includes soils labs and guided exercises in area botanical gardens, native plant preserves and specialized nurseries. Field trips have taken classes as far as New York City to examine the social, environmental and economic impacts of projects like the High Line, and to the Delaware Valley. Studio sessions include design mentorship and pin-up critiques that guide students in introducing affordable, effective and sustainable methods of stormwater mitigation, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in their design work.

The Sustainable Urban Planning Program spring studio focuses on evaluating sustainable development practices in the metropolitan region of Seoul, Republic of Korea. The studio is conducted in partnership with the Korean Research Institute on Human Settlements (KRIHS) and finishes with a trip to Seoul, departing Washington, DC in late May and returning in early June. Korea is a worldwide leader in sustainable development practice, and Seoul is an ideal setting for a studio focused on the subject. The final product of the studio is a detailed set of presentations summarizing the research findings of GW that will be delivered to KRIHS at a workshop on the final afternoon in Seoul. Students receive feedback from KRIHS staff and other experts and KRIHS will publish the GW report as part of its Special Report or Planning and Policy series.

School of Medicine and Health Sciences
In 2004, the GW School of Medicine and Health Science, in conjunction with the nonprofit organization Project Medishare, established a partnership in an effort to improve health services and education to the community of Thomonde in the Central Plateau of Haiti.  Students and faculty studying medicine, nursing, and public health embarked on nearly 15 week-long medical missions to Haiti.  Students and faculty participants care for as many as 1,000 patients for a variety of health issues including malnutrition, respiratory diseases, and arthritis. These medical missions contextualize how poverty and inequity influence health and the challenges of disaster recovery.

Alternative Breaks Program
Over the past decade, students have created, led, and participated in service opportunities through the GW Alternative Breaks program offered by the Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service. GW Alternative Breaks’ mission is to empower students, staff and faculty to understand their role in local and global communities through service-learning trips across many issue areas. It is a student-focused, student-planned, and student-led immersive experience that takes place over winter and spring breaks. The goal is to foster personal reflection, social awareness and active citizenship among the GW community. All of the trips for GW Alternative Breaks consider social inequity and many trips have focused on specifically issues of environmental sustainability. In 2014, nearly 350 students participated in seven alternative winter and eleven spring break programs. Destinations include Costa Rica, Florida, Guatemala, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Kentucky, Cherokee Nation, Chicago, DC, Detroit, Ecuador, Gullah Nation, New York City, and the Philippines. Following are four examples: 

1. Sustainable Disaster Relief in Tacloban, Philippines 
As the program’s inaugural trip to Asia, students spent a week serving in the city of Tacloban on the island of Leyte. ASB Philippines works with the Global Peace Youth Corps to conduct sustainable rebuilding throughout the region hardest hit by the typhoon. While working to quickly rebuild homes and return a sense of safety to families in the community, students were dedicated to building in a sustainable way that better prepares the region for future storms and restores the area’s natural beauty. Participants had the opportunity to immerse themselves in the exciting history and culture of the Philippines by interacting with members of the community, both learning and teaching sustainable methods of rebuilding, and explore the beaches and markets of Tacloban. 

2. Sustainability and Community Health in Los Santos, Costa Rica
The winter program in Costa Rica explored the issues of sustainability and community empowerment through a variety of activities. From the installation of eco-stoves in houses and working with youth in the community to exploration in the rainforest, this experience provided insight into the multiple facets of community service. Partnering with Green Communities Costa Rica, 10 GW students had the opportunity to lay the foundation for a lasting relationship with the communities they serve and the unique culture they experienced. 

3. Sustainable Housing and Rural Poverty in Harlan County, KY
Students served in Harlan County, Kentucky, with COAP, an organization that has been working in Appalachia since the 1970s to provide quality, sustainable housing. Participants built and repaired homes for low-income families. At the same time, they learned about economic and social issues in Appalachia including rural poverty, unemployment, and environmental degradation. 

4. Urban Farming and Community Empowerment in Chicago, IL
On this new Alternative Break to Chicago, students worked with Iron Street Farm to help promote sustainable urban farming and foster community empowerment. Students learned the ins and outs of sustainability in an urban setting, helping expand farms and building upon the site’s compost system, and exploring how Iron Street Farm employs at risk youth to develop community food systems and urban agriculture.

One format for these courses is the nine to fifteen-credit block course. Block courses engage students in understanding the complex social, economic and ecological dynamics of the region and wrestle with competing visions of the region’s future. These have included courses on the northern forest, the local foodshed, the Adirondack Mountains, the Hudson river, and sustainable building. For example, in 2014, a block course on climate change and adaptation was taught. This ten-credit block course was entitled “Local Resilience in a Changing Climate”. It included four classes and four professors: “Climate Change Law and Policy” with Christopher Brooks, “Sustainable Development: Theory and Practice” with Jacob Park, “Climate Dynamics” with John Van Hoesen, and “Media Advocacy and Campaigns” with Jason Schmidt. The interdisciplinary course explored the intersection of climate science, policy, community development, and media advocacy as tools to foster and develop community resilience in response to a changing climate. Students investigated best practices and mitigation strategies through relevant case-studies to develop recommendations for effective climate change adaptation and preparation. Through a collaborative service-learning project with the Rutland Regional Planning Commission (RRPC), course participants engaged in the local planning process to create deliverables to share with local communities about how best to position social and financial resources and strengthen their resilience in the face of global climate change.

Another immersion experience was a 3 week long study abroad experience during the 2015-16 winter break where students explored the cultural and environmental diversity of Nepal. The group, led by anthropology professor Mark Dailey and Vice President of Student Life Joe Petrick, explored the old medieval kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley, the beautiful upland Annapurna region with its views of the Himalayas, and the dynamic environments and lives of the lowland Terai region. Students prepared for the international experience by reading and discussing anthropological writings about Nepal during the fall term and then spent the next three weeks interacting with a variety of local people and environments. Along the way, they learned about ethnic politics, conservation and indigenous people, local agriculture and food, everyday religious practice, contemporary forms of yoga, and cultural tourism and rural development.

An additional format for immersion classes at Green Mountain College  is the “intensive.” Some of the intensives have been offered as part of the block courses and others have been offered on their own. For example, every summer a sustainable farm intensive is offered. During this field and table intensive, students plow the fields, milk the cows, plant the crops and manage the community supported agriculture program. They take classes and conduct research on topics like organic agriculture and farm systems. They also learn how to live differently. At the end of the day, dinner is about more than food: It's about coming together to cook, laugh and connect. The meal? It's made from produce harvested just down the gravel path from the dining table. Field work weaves into class, which weaves into living. Together, the experience helps students understand how consumption is tied to production, allowing them to navigate complex front burner issues about energy, agriculture and sustainability. Students also leave with a new appreciation for community - how to build it and what it means.

Miami's Center for Community Engagement (CCE) in Over-the-Rhine offers students a semester-long residency program in Over-the-Rhine, an underserved neighborhood in Cincinnati. The Center provides a site for learning that intersects with the needs of social movement in the the inner city. Through social engagement, the CCE's mission is to generate learning and knowledge among students, faculty, residents, and ultimately the community.

The Residency Program exemplifies the Center’s mission to work collaboratively with neighborhood organizations and residents -through courses, research, and service - in order to help formulate strategies and policies consistent with developing a community without displacement. It recently received $45,000 in funding from the John E. Fetzer Institute to implement several projects that build on the Center's collaborative residency program and the Over-the-Rhine People's Movement.

A uniqueness of the CCE is its relationship with the Over-the-Rhine People's Movement -  
 a coalition of individuals and organizations that engage with community members and students to ""foster respect, empathy and healing"" and build social capital across racial and economic divides. 

The inaugural project for the Miami University Center for Community Design's Atelier program received two awards since its completion in May 2015.  

The program has won several awards. One project students worked on: 
In October, Beasley Place at 1405-07 Republic Street was named the Ohio Community Development Corporation Association's 2015 Project of the Year. In November, the Cincinnati Preservation Association acknowledged it a with a 2015 Rehabilitation Award. The 17,000 square foot building was built in 1897 and long served as an affordable housing site in the center of Over-the-Rhine.  After a long vacancy, the historic structure now contains 13 affordable housing units,

SFU is one of six Lower Mainland post-secondary institutions involved in the City Studio Program.  
CityStudio Vancouver is an innovation hub inside City Hall where staff, university students and community members co-create, design and launch projects on the ground. The central mission of CityStudio is to innovate and experiment with the ways cities are co-created, while teaching students the skills needed to collaborate on real projects in Vancouver with City staff and community stakeholders. These projects improve our city and enrich our neighbourhoods, making the city more livable, joyful and sustainable.

CityStudio convenes stakeholders, defines problems and creates solutions while improving student skills and retaining talent in the city. CityStudio aims to create a culture change at City Hall and demonstrate future possibilities. The program is also working to build the next generation of change-makers and active city builders.

Combining the activities of dialogue process and design and strategic thinking, the studio is organized primarily around the activities of project work, from research to implementation.

Employing an integrated ‘dialogue and design’ process, students collaborate with city employees to frame problems, refine their designs, and implement their projects. The projects are vehicles for learning about how to build and nurture relationships and engage in a thorough design process. The city gets a steady flow of innovative, sustainability demonstration projects from which it can choose the best to replicate. City staff innovate more frequently and more easily as a result of this co-creation and the energy and enthusiasm students bring to the work. We have a vision for collaborative city building that provides staff, students and community members with deeply engaged experiences in 3 program areas:

1. One Year Studio Program

2. Partner Network of project-based courses on campus

3. Convening and Consulting Services for cities in Canada and around the world

Our 10 Year Vision: We aim to create City Hall in the model of a “Teaching Hospital” with universities and other cities collaborating with interdisciplinary teams of students who are co-creating and innovating solutions and real work on the ground.

In the past 3 years CityStudio has engaged 127 students in the Studio Program; 1878 students in the Partner Course Network; 75 Faculty across 6 campuses; 40 City of Vancouver staff; and over 100 guests in dialogue and consultation. We have had over 1500 people participate in our events and logged over 50,000 hours of training, projects and community action towards collaborative city building supporting the Greenest City Action Plan, and the Healthy City and Engaged City Strategies.",http://citystudiovancouver.com/,--

The professional internship consists of a minimum of 150 hours of supervised work, usually completed during the summer between the two academic years. Most internships are located in a public or nonprofit agency. Students may also elect a research internship where they would work on a university-based project. (http://ase.tufts.edu/uep/degrees/Internships.aspx)
 
First-year UEP master’s students are required to take the “Field Projects: Planning and Practice” course during the spring semester. This course integrates theory and practice by providing students with an opportunity to work intensely on real-world challenges in their areas of interest, while offering community organizations and agencies the opportunity to gain insight into priority issues and advance strategic objectives through expert analysis and advice. Students operate as consultants, usually in teams of four, on behalf of their chosen client, performing background research, gathering critical data, providing an assessment of a proposed course of action, addressing high-priority concerns, or revising a strategic plan. Examples of past field projects are surveying the opportunities for urban farming in Boston, preparing a community planning guide for public health on food access and sustainable transportation, coming up with ideas to save energy through creative competition and assessing ways to reform school food at the Boston Arts Academy. Past projects and additional information can be found on the UEP website: http://ase.tufts.edu/uep/degrees/FieldProjects.aspx

Internships in the undergraduate Environmental Studies program add first-hand experience by getting students out of the classroom and into environmental work. Internship locations are varied, but all involve at least 100 hours of service (paid or unpaid) in the summer or during the school year. Students are required to complete a poster of their work at the end of the internship and are strongly encouraged to present at the annual Tufts internship symposium. http://as.tufts.edu/environmentalStudies/internships/

Internships are required for Peace and Justice Studies majors or certificate candidates. Students who are not Peace and Justice Studies majors but are still interested in the internship and seminar have the ability to enroll. The goal of the internships is to help students think about the effectiveness of different strategies and their own personal role in the social change process. Organizations promoting nonviolence, public service, and social responsibility are the ""real world"" learning process in the Peace and Justice Studies program, and the opportunity to participate in their activities provides students with a different way to learn about ideas, interests, values, and personal growth. Students may select an internship based on their interests, such as Environment or Social Justice. http://pjs.tufts.edu/academic/internships.htm

Website URLs for several specific sustainability-focused immersive programs are included in the descriptions provided below. 

1) UC Irvine Costa Rica Program: Global Sustainability and Cultural Immersion 
The UC Irvine Costa Rica Program is an alternative-break experience sponsored by Student Housing and the Division of Student Affairs in partnership with the Division of Undergraduate Education. The program allows 14-20 UC Irvine students to experience a global sustainability and cultural immersion program leading to increased cultural competence and global leadership development. The participants serve as diplomatic ambassadors for the university as they immerse themselves in the community and culture of Costa Rica.

The program includes a 2-unit course in Winter Quarter, which lays the groundwork for the immersion trip and covers topics including: Costa Rican culture, cultural competency skills, personal identity, trip logistics, expectations, academic study topic preparation, and team building. Students participate in a field trip to the UCI Arboretum where they experience local nature and wildlife in Irvine, creating a basis for comparison once in-country. Early in the quarter, students go on an overnight retreat, within Orange County, designed to continue preparation for the Costa Rica experience. 

During spring break, students travel to Costa Rica where the in-country portion begins with a visit to the rural farm village of Mastatal and a stay at Siempre Verde, an environmental learning center specializing in organic farming and sustainable development. Students experience open-air living, farm-to-table organic meals, composting toilets, outdoor showers and rural daily life. They also have the opportunity to visit two other environmental learning centers, Rancho Mastatal and Villas Mastatal, that specialize in sustainable building, research and living and allow students to explore rural community structure, tropical ecology, medicinal plant use, Costa Rican education, sustainable chocolate farming, reforestation, ecotourism, sustainable development & building, indigenous issues and composting. While in Mastatal, students also participate in service projects for the community.  In 2012 and 2013, students continued work on a greenhouse at the local primary school, which was constructed using sustainable material (bamboo grown in the forest). In 2014, participants cleaned and painted a nearby primary school, and in 2015, participants worked on the Community Center in town and helped start a tree nursery.

Students with prior experience in the program serve to lead activities in subsequent years, fostering a student-centered knowledge base and co-teaching. Prior to the field program, students and advisors host two orientation meetings to introduce participants to the Imperial Valley region and discuss the logistics and responsibilities of the program. 

Based at the Steele-Burnand Desert Research Station in Borrego Springs, program participants spend the first days learning about desert ecology and sustainability through interactive talks, hikes with State Park rangers, tours of the Visitor’s Center and Paleontology Lab at Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, and a driving tour of the Salton Sea. The remainder of the program involves education and outreach activities at the Salton Sea, Borrego Springs schools, and the State Park. Specific activities may include giving presentations and leading hands-on projects on the Salton Sea, leading round-table discussions on sustainability, advising high school students on science fair projects and sharing the experience of being at UC Irvine, meeting with community organizations to discuss local health and equity challenges in the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, doing maintenance and grounds-keeping activities at the State Park (e.g., removal of invasive weeds), or assisting with the work of local soup kitchens. No credit is received for participation in this program.

3) Global Brigades:
Global Brigades is the world’s largest student-led global health and sustainable development organization. Since 2007, UC Irvine has established six chapters of Global Brigades on campus: dental, environmental, medical, micro-finance, public health and water. UCI students in the Global Brigades program have participated in immersive experiences of seven to 10 days during summer, spring and winter breaks. The Global Public Health Brigade and Global Environmental Brigade have most recently provided immersive experiences for UCI students in Honduras and Panama. In Honduras, UCI students worked with locals to install eco-stoves, latrines, water storage units and concrete floors. The stoves replace traditional wood-burning ones that emit harmful smoke particles and soot, reducing indoor air pollution; concrete floors cut down on dust contamination and the transmission of Chagas disease by dirt-dwelling insects; latrines allow for sanitary waste disposal; and water storage units provide sources of clean water. They also conducted a public health workshop for children and participated in a community assessment where they observed past and present construction projects and collaboratively discussed ways to improve future projects. Toward the end of the trip, they visited orphanages to distribute hygienic and educational supplies collected throughout the school year. In Panama, students worked to mitigate ecological degradation and develop sustainable environmental practices through projects such as environmental educational workshops & curriculum, greenhouse establishments, native species reforestation, eco-stove and composite toilet construction, and slow-sand water filter development. In 2016, the six sub-chapters of Global Brigades will continue organizing immersion trips. This year, the environmental brigade will travel to Panama, and the water brigade will visit Honduras.

The CORE 1 Course—which is subtitled “The World at Home:  Planning for the Future in a Complex World”—is future-oriented, to help students gain the intellectual tools, knowledge and insights they will need as informed citizens devising solutions to real-life problems. CORE 1 aims to understand the world at large as it is reflected in California’s current issues. By examining, for example, the local evidence of global problems, students grapple with the issues that affect them personally and professionally.

CORE 1 poses a set of questions as they are framed by the various domains of human knowledge known as the disciplines. In CORE 1, UC Merced faculty introduce students to how their disciplines define the challenges faced by informed citizens of this new century.

For example:
• Can advances in technology mitigate the effects of burgeoning populations and resource depletion?
• How will a changing climate affect the future migration of human populations?
• How do citizens decide among conflicting ethical choices, each with a compelling claim?

Faculty from all three Schools join together to show how such complex questions might best be probed through connecting the insights of their disciplines.

In CORE 1, students:
• work together in groups on joint projects or problems to build leadership and teamwork abilities;
• learn to think analytically and communicate effectively in the context of problems affecting their lives and futures; and
• use quantitative methods as well as ethical judgment to make decisions and defend those decisions to peers;

A hallmark of the course is a disaster scenario collaborative assignment where students complete an abbreviated drought plan for California. The prompt reads:  “As researchers who consult for the California Department of Water Resources, your team must develop a targeted two-year policy for identifying and distributing currently available water while balancing the needs of humans with those of the environment. The governor has asked for a statistically-informed narrative proposal with visual displays of information (including data pertaining to contexts such as residential, agricultural, industrial, commercial, civic, and/or environmental uses) in which your team details a plan for allocating a significant amount of our current water reserves toward an overall reduction rate of at least 25%.”

James Clark School of Engineering’s student group Engineers Without Borders (EWB), the University’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond the campus and the region to global projects in developing nations. Founded in 2004 and led by faculty advisor Dr. David Lovell, the UMD chapter of this national organization sends groups of students overseas to help communities meet common engineering problems with sustainable solutions. Students and faculty work with local groups over several years to assess needs and options, and to implement multi-phase projects. 

     Maryland's chapter of EWB has an ongoing relationship with a community in Burkina Faso. Several EWB teams have traveled to Burkina Faso to supply electricity and fresh water to a medical clinic in the small town of Dissin. Solar powered lighting and a solar-powered water pumping station, sanitation and distribution system were designed and installed at the clinic by EWB students. Teaching community members how to use and maintain the new technologies is also an important component of EWB's relationship with Dissin.

     In the fall of 2014, students from the University’s chapter of Engineers Without Borders turned their attention from environmental issues in developing countries to sustainable solutions in the campus’s own backyard. The Maryland Sustainability Engineering (MDSE) students turned classroom knowledge into civic action, the students created and implemented a bioretention system to help the nearby community along the Paint Branch Trail with stormwater management. Normally, rainwater runoff from parking lots, roofs, and other impervious surfaces runs into the nearby water, carrying pollutants and redistributing them over the ground when flooding occurs. To reroute and filter this polluted water, the students designed a bioretention system to channel runoff and filter out pollutants.

University of Massachusetts Lowell,2016-02-04,2016-02-04 11:33:15,Tyler_Arrigo@uml.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Civil Engineering Senior Project – In April 2014, 6 civil engineering students designed a warehouse for medical supplies in Haiti as part of their senior project.  The project included navigating the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding country-side for a week during their spring break.  Their work, done with limited resources, required making a host of engineering decisions, engaging locals to work with them for nominal sums, and navigating the bureaucracy of a foreign country. In the process, they learned firsthand what people who live in Haiti grapple with every day.  Whether their design will get built is unclear. Partners in Health is juggling a number of potential projects in the area, and whether the warehouse is their greatest need has yet to be figured out.  But for the students, the fate of their design is secondary to the hands-on education they got in trying to come to terms with — and solve — the problems of an impoverished area. It opened their eyes, they said, to what engineering can accomplish.  The project has already had an impact among his students: 18 have signed up to raise money to fund another senior trip to Haiti in 2015. For a program committed to connecting theory and practice, that’s a welcome development.",http://www.uml.edu/News/news-articles/2014/globe-lowell-haiti.aspx,--

Through a series of lectures from distinguished INCAE Business School Professors and Costa Rican government officials, stimulating class discussions, and research projects, students will learn about sustainable business development, social enterprise, and Latin American business strategies. Beyond the classroom, learning will be further facilitated during interactive visits to companies in local free trade zones, civil society organizations, and ecotourism excursions.

Example 2:Detroit, MI Sustainable Neighborhoods: Experiential Learning & Active Engagement in Detroit: Learn hands-on about sustainability issues facing Southeast Michigan through this four-credit, undergraduate course. Through this unique experiential course, participants will learn about: The confluence of food systems, the built environment, transportation, and social justice in urban settings; the concept and realities of sustainability in urban environments; ways communities and neighborhoods can respond to changing environments; Detroit’s history and culture.  The concept of sustainability is complex. Not only does it include multiple environmental, social, and economic dimensions, but it also depends a great deal on the context and conditions of the sustainability issue being considered. The view of sustainability is further complicated when applied to a declining urban center like Detroit, where issues of social justice are intimately entwined with concerns for environmental quality and the quest for economic stability. Interestingly, in Detroit and other declining rust-belt cities, hardships have opened new frontiers in what constitutes sustainable development. Cities like Detroit are in the process of redefining a different approach of how residents collaborate to create bottom-up solutions to resolve seemingly insurmountable problems. As a result, the movement toward more sustainable neighborhoods in this context requires careful, in-depth assessment of the local culture, the economic conditions, and environmental realities at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. In the ""Sustainable Neighborhoods"" course, we will focus our attention on how issues of sustainability and social justice co-mingle around the topics of transportation systems, food systems, and the built environment.

Example 3: Toward a Sustainable Environment in Light of the Changing Face of Rural & Urban China: In collaboration with the Beijing University of Technology's College of Architecture and Urban Planning, program participants research, document, and react to the changing face of rural China in one specific locale: the Shang Shui Guo Village in the Pearl River Valley Township near Beijing. Research will lead to the development of a new rural prototype house as well as a series of specific recommendations on how to convert the historic structures and environment to meet modern standards.  In an era where it has become clear that massive urbanization is becoming less and less sustainable (environmentally, economically, socially, and culturally), a larger aim of this project— which turns its attention toward the rural village (away from the long held architect’s obsession with urban-ism)— is to find ways to create a rural environment that is more viable as a contemporary place for human habitation.

The program will integrate students' academic, residential, civic, and global engagement centered around a thematic topic. During the first fall semester experience, students enroll in a one-unit course, live together in Lakeview Hall, travel regionally together, and have significant community-based learning. Then in the spring semester, students will participate individually in semester-long study abroad and investigate the topic globally. Upon returning from abroad, students will enroll in a .5-unit course that will connect the topic back locally through a capstone project. The first L2G topic is focused on water, social justice and energy development involving local and global civic engagement. Students learn to analyze the issues surrounding water from multiple worldviews/cultural contexts. Finally, the learning from the different local and global contexts will be synthesized during the capstone in the third semester. Any rising sophomore or junior can apply to participate in this program.

The Earth Lodge is a residential experience which aims to offer an immersive experience that provides students an opportunity to engage in communal dialogue about human connections with nature, environmental issues, and sustainability. The community of students is required to take a class, which varies from year to year, but with a common goal to facilitate the involvement of students with their local ecosystem. The final project of the class focuses natural resource stewardship within the local environment. For example, a project last year analyzed the potential impacts of a proposed natural gas pipeline in the state. Students live together for a year, taking the course in the fall and completing projects in the spring. As part of the requirements of living in the community, students must participate in a short service learning activity at a local park. They also participate in a five-day experiential learning trip in the fall and a two-day trip in the spring.   

The SEEDS Project is a student-run organization that exists to work alongside marginalized communities and to examine the complexities of American society to develop a better understanding of service both locally and nationally. SEEDS (Students Engaging and Enacting a Dialogue on Service) embodies its long-term vision by creating sustainable relationships with the communities they visit, while also developing meaningful friendships among the participants. Although they aim to provide support to marginalized communities, the primary goal of the SEEDS Project is to engage students in discussion and reflection on social injustice.

In order to fulfill its mission, the SEEDS Project offers two alternative spring break trips for students at the University of Richmond, one in Louisiana and the other in West Virginia. The group has developed a disciplined service-learning experience that involves manual labor and most importantly, conversations in and around the communities in which participants engage. The SEEDS Project highlights the history of the region, connects to a variety of leaders and people in the community, and initiates educational exercises and reflections before, during, and after the trips.

Many opportunities for meaningful engagement in sustainability are available to students through the University of Richmond Study Abroad program. Programs at the International Education of Students (IES) Freiburg in southwest Germany, the Danish Institute for Study Abroad (DIS) in Copenhagen, Denmark, offer a multitude of hands-on sustainability options.

Western Michigan University,2016-02-24,2016-02-24 12:21:49,jeffrey.spoelstra@wmich.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Several colleges incorporate social sustainability by providing services to nonprofit organizations at no charge.  For example, the College of Health and Human Services students and faculty extend the energy of the college and Western Michigan University through significant community engagement and service. With required internships, field placements and clinical rotations alone, faculty supervised College of Health and Human Services students provide more than 450,000 hours of service annually to children and families in the community and region. Substantial volunteerism increases this positive impact. For example, the School of Social Work offers a community organizing course in which students serve as block organizers.  The project is a collaborative effort of community organizations, including Building Blocks of Kalamazoo (BBC), to involve local residents in the physical and social revitalization of their neighborhoods, strengthening social bonds and increasing participation in the development of their own communities.

Utilizing grants and organizing support from the BBC, students organize neighborhood residents and help facilitate planning and implementation of a broad range of repair and beautification projects such as painting, landscaping and minor repairs. 

Residents volunteer their labor and work together to improve not only their own homes, but also their neighbors’ homes. They also volunteer their time preparing food, supervising, or volunteering their homes for meeting space. Most importantly, through cooperation and involvement in the project activities, residents bond with each other and ensure a sense of commitment to their street and neighborhood association.

As resident leaders emerge throughout the activities, students become facilitators and residents assume primary responsibility for completing project tasks, including recruitment, planning, choosing project activities, making arrangements for food, materials, and supplies.",http://www.wmich.edu/hhs/community,--

Courses offered in the 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016 academic year include:

Bhutan and Gross National Happiness
In this course students will learn about Bhutan’s culture, religious traditions, environmental challenges and how together, these shape the country’s conservation policies and the role of natural resources in rural livelihoods and national development. We will explore the diverse geology and biodiversity of the Himalayas, the adaptation by flora and fauna to unique ecosystems, and natural hazards of high alpine environments, along with human approaches to mitigate these hazards. This trip will include multiple hikes, field visits to community forestry projects and rural farms, a service learning project, and meetings and discussions with government ministers, Buddhist monks, sustainable forestry managers, and college students and professors at the Royal Thimphu College of Bhutan.

Europe on the Edge
The participants in this study experience will travel southward through Central Europe from Berlin to Venice, paralleling important historical and cultural borders including The Iron Curtain, The Eastern Front of World Wars I and II, the border between Slavic and Germanic linguistic and ethnic groups, and, at times, the boundary between the Christian, Islamic, and Semitic populations. Students will engage in site visits and reflective activities geared toward developing their abilities to think across boundaries. The roles these borderlands have played in the creation of geopolitical, cultural, psychological, and environmental boundaries in history and the social sciences will also be addressed.


An American in Paris
Hemingway famously described Paris as “a movable feast” and by this he meant that the city’s culture absorbed in youth would stay with the lucky traveler for a lifetime. Our May Term Study Experience emphasizes Paris’s remarkable cultural depth at the same time it challenges our students to respond to its variety in the course of an extended residence. But as Hemingway’s own life shows, Paris is not a place for passive touring. The group will focus on the active expression of their own ideas in response to the human and natural landscape around them. Paris became the center of the Western art world with the birth of Modernism. Artists, musicians, writers and dancers from all over the world gathered in this beautiful city to be a part of its vibrant scene. Of course, Parisian culture was built on creative expression since long before this time, and its artistic vitality continues today. We will live in Paris for the month. We will visit galleries and museums, and attend performances and events. We will experience significant art in the place it was made, and we will make art of our own. This trip promises a distinctive learning experience for Westminster students because it balances visits to inspiring cultural touchstones with sustained personal creative responsibilities. In the footsteps of Gertrude Stein and Richard Wright, Benjamin Franklin and Henry James, these young Americans will enjoy the conventional aspects of a study trip and harvest the labors of an extended artistic residency.

The Sciences and History of Hawaii
This course will take a multidisciplinary approach to studying the island of Hawaii.  Hawaii is one of the newest landmasses on Earth, and therefore can provide scientists with insights into how islands form and become inhabited.  The fact that this is such a new natural environment does not, however, mean that it is pristine.  Already this island is being adversely affected not only by the natural elements but also by commercial exploitation.  An important aspect of our discussions will be not only how this island has formed, but also the responsibilities that people have for responsible stewardship of the island known as “America’s Paradise.” Hawaii’s history is also unique, and the “big island” of Hawaii stands at the center of that history.  The islands were forged into a powerful independent kingdom from Hawaii.  British Captain James Cook landed there, establishing European contact but meeting his own death.  The islands eventually became sites for missionary activity, whaling, and commercial agriculture at the expense of the native population, whose numbers were decimated, as well as native flora and fauna, which also suffered.  In the late 19th century Hawaii became one of the first targets of American imperialists, who overthrew the native monarchy and brought the islands under American control.  This history raises important questions of social justice and native sovereignty.

Exploring Hopi and Navajo Nations
This course introduces students to Hopi and Navajo peoples. It includes social, educational, environmental, political, economic, artistic, health and caring aspects of their cultures. Special emphasis will be placed on the practical aspects of health care and observation in the schools. There will be a nine-day field trip designed for students to explore health issues, educational practices, and ecosystems on Hopi and Navajo reservations in northern Arizona and southern Utah. Students will visit Indian Health Services and private health care facilities, schools on reservations, Hopi and possibly Navajo families, museums, and possibly National Park sites. Students will participate in guided field and river trips. Students will also spend one day visiting related sites in Salt Lake City after the nine-day field experience.

Service Learning in Colombia:  Perspectives on Culture, Global Health, and Spanish
This course provides a cultural immersion and service-learning opportunity to explore health needs of rural and urban populations as they work alongside local health care providers and foundations while incorporating public health/medical/cultural Spanish vocabulary. Students will gain an understanding of the region's health care needs as well as an introduction to components of community assessment. Students will also explore traditional medical and folk practices in an effort to understand beliefs about health,  healing, and healthy and sustainable relationships with the environment. Students will travel though Bogotá, along the mountainous terrain of the Andes through cloud forests, coffee and plantain plantations, “páramos” (all high, tropical, mountain vegetation above the continuous timberline) and villages to Villa de Leyva (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site) to Armenia and to Bucaramanga where the landscape is stark, barren and dramatic. Finally, the group will visit the Caribbean in Cartagena de Indias and enjoy the natural scenery. It will be possible to snorkel near coral reefs, see the various  species of the Caribbean, listen to tropical music while serving and projecting the public health program. Students will also participate in a home stay with the local population in Bucaramanga and in rural/urban hotels in order to be exposed to agriculture, conservation, cooking local food, and immersion in the culture of the local residents.
