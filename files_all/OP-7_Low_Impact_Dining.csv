Students can easily build a balanced meal in the eateries where we offer “all you care to eat” service. Vegetable dishes are offered on every line, fruits are displayed prominently, the salad bar items rotate weekly and there is only one dessert option per meal. Designing a positive food environment for students is fundamental. It’s counterproductive to serve foods that contradict the nutrition messaging you promote. These menu changes are focused on balancing meals and communicating to students where their food comes from, what’s in the food, and how healthy eating can positively affect them and the environment.   

 For all students, but especially those trying to follow a particular diet, transparency is important. Our MyMeal program allows students to view nutrition information by menu item and individual ingredient online. This program has been available for our board dining menus for the past two academic years and is being rolled out this fall for the menus in the retail units. 

Students make food selections for a host of reasons, but we pay special attention to ensure safety to those who do so out of medical necessity. We provide meal accommodations to students with medically restricted diets, food allergies and dietary intolerances. Students who register with our Student and Employee Accessibility Office are connected to the dining services dietitian immediately. Our dietitian can offer individualized counseling so that these students can eat safely within our eateries and with their peers. 

Eating in college is about having an experience. We build spaces where students can gather to eat and socialize and students with special dietary needs are not excluded from this experience. When a medical necessity arises, a student can access our online ordering system to request meals that are prepared separately and free of certain allergens. The meals are eaten in the same dining centers among their friends. In our most popular eatery students are given access to an Allergy-Friendly Pantry. We not only offer special foods free of the top eight allergens, but there are separate toasters, microwaves and utensils so they can prepare their food safely. 

Students come to Brown with very well established food preferences and we pay attention to those needs. Herbivores dominate. There are specially segmented dining options for vegetarians and vegans. One eatery, The Ivy Room, is all vegetarian at night, our main dining center has one line dedicated to vegan and vegetarian dishes and options suitable for this group are available in every retail space.  We strive to make this food appeal to all our students, so even among our more liberal eaters, vegetarian options are popular. 

Brown Dining offers Kosher / Halal meal plans for observant Jewish and Muslim students. There is a section of the main dining center designated for Kosher and Halal meal service so that students can adhere to dietary laws while dining with friends.
","Brown Dining Services strives to provide the most sustainable, healthy and nutritious food possible.   Each recipe begins at the individual ingredient level so we think closely about the quality and sourcing of each item. To accomplish this goal our department has locally sourced 97% of its seafood and 95% of its cage free eggs.  It has purchased 100% of its coffee as fair trade and ecologically sound through Sun Coffee Roasters and has focused on providing hormone and antibiotic free beef through Niman Ranch.  Our partnerships with local vendors are extensive and go beyond the dining room. In addition to supporting local producers through our regular menus, we also host a weekly Farmer’s Market during the growing season.  Vendors set-up a market among the hustle and bustle, giving anyone on campus access to the same high quality, fresh picked produce we use.

The year 2015 was a banner year for dining services at Colgate and we spent significant time and energy ensuring that sustainability is well-represented and advancing in our food and dining service operations on campus.  Here are a few areas that we focused on:

Sustainable Dining Services Advisory Group.  Throughout 2015, a diverse group of faculty, staff, students, and key dining service representatives made progress to ensure that sustainability is well represented in Dining Services.  We are pursuing the recommendations and goals highlighted in our 2014 summary report to the President’s Staff.  We met more than a half-dozen times in 2015 and helped to guide the development of a new food procurement benchmarking and tracking system, hiring and training of our new manager of sustainability in dining services, working with the Chartwells team during their transition, and further defining what a sustainable dining services program entails.
Dining Services Contract.  This committee helped to select Chartwells as our new dining services vendor.  We spent significant time in 2015 on this process working with our consultants, the committee, our broader community, and the Chartwells team to ensure that our community’s priorities were expressed and sustainability was represented in a significant way. 

Manager of Sustainability in Dining Services.  In 2015, Colgate created and hired our first manager of sustainability in dining services.  This work included justifying and getting approval of the position, writing the job description, advertising the opening, organizing a search committee, reviewing applications, conducting interviews and making a final decision.  

Community Garden Project.  Last year was the garden's first full year at our new location on Broad Street (south of the Townhouses).  The garden produced over 4,000 lbs of produce and we sold half to dining services on campus and we donated half to the Hamilton Food Cupboard.  The sale of our produce covered our operating costs.

Tackling Food’s Role in Climate Change


How we eat is affecting the planet, but a handful of simple dietary choices and practices can have the same impact as switching from driving a large SUV to a more fuel-efficient sedan. Greenhouse gases created by the food system — including production, distribution, and waste — are responsible for one-third of global emissions. At Bon Appétit, we see that as opportunity to make positive change.

Launched in 2007, our Low Carbon Diet program was the product of two years of research aimed at reducing our carbon “foodprint.” In 2008, we launched our first Low Carbon Diet Day, an annual educational event about food and climate change tied to Earth Day. In collaboration with the nonprofit group Ecotrust, we also launched the Low Carbon Diet calculator at  EatLowCarbon.org, an educational website illustrating these principles.

Our standards
•Minimize our reliance on red meat and cheese, through menu choices and careful portioning.
•Source 100% of our meats, vegetables, and non-tropical fruit from North American farms.
•Avoid air-freighted seafood (and reducing other flown-in items, including tropical fruit)

Santa Clara University Dining Services by Bon Appètit takes pride in providing sustainable, fresh, unique cuisine and exceptional service for our family at Santa Clara University. ","Bon Appetit’s effort to reduce the impact of its animal-derived food purchases is demonstrated through the Circle of Responsibility (COR) Initiatives. COR highlights the commitment when purchasing: chicken, turkey, ground beef patties, shell eggs, fish and seafood, milk, and yogurt. Between the years 2002-2013, these commitments include the following: 
All seafood purchases are made in accordance with the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s guidelines; 
All of the milk comes from cows not treated with artificial bovine growth hormones (rBGH); 
Chicken and turkey is raised without antibiotics as a routine food or water additive; 
Ground Beef is “natural”, our suppliers committed to using no antibiotics, no added growth hormones, and no animal byproducts in feed; 
Extending our commitment to cage-free shell eggs to liquid eggs by 2015; 
All pork will be produced without gestation crate confinement systems by 2015. 

In addition, since 2008, all of Bon Appetit’s cafés take part in an annual ‘Low Carbon Diet Day’, which is an event that showcases the effort to reduce climate change through food choices. The Low Carbon Diet is Bon Appetit’s program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food service operations, and to educate staff and students about how food contributes to climate change. On this one day, the cafés undergo a menu transformation that highlights sustainable items that will help prolong the life of our planet – i.e. serving turkey burgers instead of beef burgers, as beef burgers emit methane gas into our environment.

Vegan items are clearly labeled, and alternatives made available almost every food station in the dining area.
The Byte, the library cafe, offers only vegetarian/vegan food options. 
We do not currently offer any strictly vegan promotions, but we hold an annual event called Low Carbon Diet Day (LCD). LCD educates our customers on the impact of food on climate change, especially beef and dairy. On that day we eliminate beef from our menus. When customers order a hamburger, for instance, they are told that we are not offering them on that day and why. They are then sold an alternative item (black bean burger, etc.)
On Mondays, the hot food station inside of the cafeteria offer and promote their 'Meatless Mondays' option.
","When Bon Appétit started the Low Carbon Diet program in 2007, it was with specific targets in mind for how much carbon emissions we wanted to reduce over five years. The goal of reductions of the equivalent of approximately 5 million pounds of carbon dioxide each month has been made.

In coming up with dining options, the catering service focuses on these four areas:
--Serving reasonable, clearly defined portions of animal proteins based on U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommendations
--Skewing the menu mix away from beef and cheese
--Emphasizing plant-based proteins
--Tracking the ounces of various proteins we serve per guest per meal period, to make sure we stay on target

When purchasing meats, focus is put on:
--No air-freighted seafood
--Purchasing meat from North American farms and ranches (fed with U.S.-grown crops)
--Serve tuna that comes with a signed statement that no fish aggregating device (FAD) was used.
--All ground beef served in Bon Appétit cafés should be sourced from suppliers that have met the strict standards of one of four independent animal-welfare organizations.
--Requiring that the pork BA serves be produced without gestation crate confinement systems, using higher-welfare group housing systems instead.

EATEC helps manage inventory while lowering food and labor costs and increasing efficiency. We also ask our suppliers for reports that we cross-reference with the EATEC reports to ensure the reporting is correct.

Our Sustainable Food Program Manager runs reports throughout the year to ensure our chefs are complying with our sustainability standards. In R&DE Stanford Dining, those standards for animal products include: organic and local milk from Straus Creamery, grass-fed beef from Australia, antibiotic free chicken, cage free eggs, organic and local produce, humane pork butt from Niman Ranch, Fair Trade coffees and teas, wild Alaskan salmon from Taku River Reds fishery, and Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch approved seafood.

R&DE has found that through the chef’s menuing efforts and education of students, animal proteins have decreased by 14% and vegetable based proteins have increased by 29%. 
",True,True,True,"R&DE provides vegan meals in all dining halls on all days. The dining halls have “Performance Dining” options that are all vegetarian, with at least one or two vegan options at lunch and dinner. Each Performance Dining area has a bean or tofu dish, whole grain dish, vegetable side, and leafy greens dish (i.e. chard, kale, spinach, etc.). R&DE always provides at least one
vegetarian soup, and many are vegan as well. Each of the 11 dining halls also has a make-your-own salad bar with homemade salad dressings. R&DE Stanford Dining labels all vegetarian and vegan options as well as the top eight allergens for all food. Vegetarian and vegan options are always labeled. R&DE Stanford Dining has a vegan Dining Ambassador who solicits ideas from vegan students and communicates with them about new menu items. 

In 2014-15, Stanford earned an A on Peta2's Vegan Report Card and is currently in contention for Peta2's Favorite Vegan-Friendly College Contest, with a 96% student satisfaction rating.

In addition, R&DE runs free cooking classes for students throughout the year, including vegan classes. Finally, R&DE Stanford Hospitality and Auxiliaries has vegan and vegetarian options in all cafes, catering operations, and concessions on campus. All R&DE dining facilities are open to all members of the campus community and their guests.
","R&DE is committed to reducing the impact of our animal-derived food purchases. We also strive to constantly improve our Sustainable Food Program and continue to minimize our impact on the environment and purchase more humane options.

One of the main principles of the Menus of Change program is to reduce animal proteins and increase plant proteins. Our chefs have been using these principles in menu development, including creating a burger that replaces half of the beef with mushrooms (this is our standard burger in the dining halls). A few years ago, we reduced the number of meat options at each meal from two to one. This year, we removed the daily grill option (chicken, burgers, and hot dogs), and replaced it a few days a week with a plated vegetarian and meat dish that does not focus on meat. 

R&DE partnered with the Stanford Design School and Stanford Medical School to run a study in the dining halls to determine how to get students to reduce meat consumption. We have taken the results from those studies and incorporated them in both the designs of our dining halls and our Performance Dining signage. Additionally, we design our menu to have plenty of delicious entrees

Currently, our systems don’t enable us to separate out and track expenditures on animal products",True,True,True,"Each of our eight restaurants and cafes across campus as well as our food truck offer at least one hot vegan entree at every meal.  Many of our restaurants offer made to order options or offerings that are highly customizable allowing students to choose create a variety of delicious vegan meals.  These stations include but are not limited to pasta sautes, hand tossed salads, stir-fry, sandwiches and grill items.  Non-meat protein options in these areas include Gardein, tofu, beans, portabella and hummus.  Two of our restaurants have vegetarian/vegan stations or complete vegetarian/vegan kitchens that provide foods tailored to students following this lifestyle.  
Vegan and vegetarian lifestyles are promoted throughout the restaurants by dining services.  Nutrition and Wellness boards are present in all restaurants that provide a key for the nutrition icons (including the vegan VG symbol and the vegetarian VT symbol), the nutritionist's name and contact information, and tips for how to eat healthy on campus including how to eat healthy within a vegan lifestyle.  Vegan and vegetarian lifestyles are also promoted from a sustainability standpoint.  Information from the Environmental Working Group is posted in the restaurants, showing the link between eating less meat and cheese and an improvement in health as well as a reduction in environmental impact.  
In addition to this, our full-time on-staff nutritionist meets with a group of vegan and vegetarian students at least once a semester to discuss their specific needs and issues.  These forums provide a lot of insight into the needs, wants and concerns of our vegan and vegetarian students and allows an open channel of communication.  
SUNY Geneseo also received an “A” from PETA on their Vegan Report Card.
","Another effort that has been made by dining services to reduce the impact of its animal-derived food purchases is to alter its recipes to be naturally vegan or vegetarian.  The nutritionist works with the culinary team when creating menus, and offers suggestions on how to replace bases, stocks, and other ingredients that traditionally contain animal-derived products with vegetarian and vegan alternatives.  The chefs incorporate these changes into their menus, allowing for a greater variety of naturally vegetarian and vegan options.  
Another effort involves focusing more on customizable, made-to-order menu items.  In addition to creating greater customer satisfaction by having each dish individually and freshly prepared to the student’s specifications, the pricing of the made-to-order dishes varies depending upon the protein chosen, with vegetarian proteins costing less than animal proteins, causing a financial incentive for students to choose a vegan or vegetarian option.

Specifically, Sodexo will champion animal well-being within the following supply chains:

Eggs:  Following their successful transition to cage-free shelled eggs, Sodexo will now move to sourcing only cage-free liquid eggs with a carefully phased-in approach that will be complete by the end of 2020. As the cage-free liquid egg supply grows, they will work with our clients and suppliers to incorporate cage-free eggs into their operations.

Pork:  Sodexo is on track to meet their commitment to eliminate gestation crates from their pork supply chain by 2022. In addition, they will work with suppliers to ensure the use of pain relief protocols, particularly as they relate to de-horning, castration and tail-docking.

",True,True,True,"We offer complete-protein vegan options at all meals in all Dining Services facilities on campus. All three of our DCs offer a vegan entree at every meal, as well as “Vegan Corner” dips and salads. Two of these DCs have exclusively vegan platforms. We also offer vegan options in our two retail locations as part of our Simply to Go lunch take out program.

Within our Dining Commons:
Blue Onion: Two of our Dining Commons have an exclusively vegan platform that features a vegan entre at each meal. No animal products are prepared at this platform at any time. Seasonality East at Cuarto DC also provides a vegan entre at each meal.

Vegan Corner: Each Dining Commons has an area adjacent to the salad bar with all vegan, house made sides, dips and salads. We feature Romesco, hummus, pickled veggies, flatbread, etc. at this station, all of which are vegan.

SPE: Our SPE Certified Taste platform regularly serves vegetarian and vegan options as main dishes. If the featured item contains meat, all attempts are made to offer vegan/vegetarian versions. 

Catering: Full vegan and vegetarian menu options are offered through University Catering.

Menu Labeling: All menu items are labeled in blue (vegan), red (vegetarian) and black (contains meat/fish/poultry).

Meatless Mondays: We compile a menu each Monday with all of the vegetarian and vegan options that is advertised as the Meatless Monday menu. We also do tabling outreach 6-8 times a year to engage students on Meatless Mondays.

UC Davis Dining Services has been offering vegetarian and vegan alternatives in Resident Dining since 1989 when there was a special dining facility devoted to vegetarian and “natural” food. Since then, many demolitions and renovations later, the menu has evolved and includes vegetarian and vegan options at all dining rooms, all meals and in the retail dining venue, the Silo, as well.

The menu signage used in Resident Dining is color coded and indicates whether any given food is vegan, vegetarian, or neither using colored font. Blue labels are vegan, red labels are vegetarian, and black labels contain meat, poultry or fish.

In June 2007, the house-made vegan desserts program was launched. Examples include: peanut butter cookies, ginger snaps, chocolate raspberry bar and banana oat cookies at lunch, with orange creamsicle cake, chocolate espresso cake and oatmeal fruit nut bars at dinner. When ‘frost your own cupcake’ bar is featured, vegan cupcakes and icing are part of the set-up. When there is a ‘make your own sundae’ event, Larry and Luna’s Coconut Bliss is available. Education on why a vegan lifestyle can be beneficial to human health and the health of the planet is presented regularly to market these selections.

In September 2007, UC Davis Dining Services began offering a completely vegan grill twice a month in Resident Dining. September 2007 also marked the beginning of promotion of the Meatless Monday campaign (in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health) in Resident Dining. 

Dining Services began producing seitan from hi-gluten flour in September 2007 for use as vegan protein in recipes. The flour used is Food Alliance certified Shephard’s Grain flour. This seitan is made in theculinary support center for use in all dining units as a vegan protein – the product can be ground, cut in strips, or used in steaks for a wide variety of meatless dishes and sandwiches.

In September 2008, a new Vegan Corner concept was established in each Resident Dining facility.

The vegan council, a student advisory group, was formed to offer suggestions and help make decisions on which foods to add to enhance the vegan corner area of the dining room. Currently offered are: sprouted wheat bread, soft tofu, vegan spread/dip (rotates daily – includes romescu, hummus, babaganoush, etc. with pita chips), tahini, seed mixture for salad/entrees, Bragg’s Liquid
Aminos, and nutritional yeast for sprinkling on anything. 

In 2010, UC Davis was voted among the top 10 for PETA’s “Most Vegan Friendly American Colleges.”

2. Dining Services tracks sustainable food products separately, so totals for certified seafood, sustainably raised meats, and cage-free eggs were subtracted from overall food product category totals (total spent on animal products) generated by step one. 
3. The resulting dollar amount was divided by Dining Services total spending on food products, excluding franchises and convenience shops.",True,True,True,"Dining Services offers many vegetarian and vegan selections, including a vegan station in The Diner, Seasons 12 Mongolian Grill at South Campus, and a large selection of vegetarian and vegan items at 251 North. Each night, there is a vegan option or alternative for the daily Chef’s Feature meal. All vegan and vegetarian items are labeled in the nutritional database and on menu boards. ","Students from numerous groups interested in sustainable food joined with Dining Services and the Green Dining interns to hold the first Leave Small FoodPrints event in Spring 2014. Coinciding with Earth Day, Leave Small FoodPrints encouraged students to choose low-carbon meals (meals with lower carbon emissions associated with food production and transportation) in the North Campus Diner and South Campus Dining Hall. The pilot event highlighted a vegetarian spinach lasagna, a less carbon intense option than meat lasagna. Students and Dining Services staff sampled the spinach lasagna, and this eco-friendly option sold out at both dining halls. Dining Services worked with the Office of Sustainability to obtain numbers and statistics on the meals’ carbon and water footprints for the event; these numbers were displayed on signs at the Chef’s Feature station, where the dishes were being served.

Students tabled at each dining hall, sharing information about how to Leave Small FoodPrints, methodology behind the water and carbon numbers, and a whiteboard for students to vote on which low-carbon meals they would most like to see in the dining halls. (The results of this vote will be used to plan future Leave Small FoodPrints events.) Table tents were placed in the dining halls for the event as well.
The pilot Leave Small FoodPrints event served as a guide for future events focused on exploring low-carbon meals available in the dining halls and educating students about how their eating habits impact the climate. There are opportunities to highlight not just foods that emit less carbon in their production, but also local foods with less transportation-related emissions. There have been several additional Leave Small FoodPrints events: Food Day in fall 2014, Earth Day in spring 2015, and Food Day in fall 2015.

The Dining Services sustainability office began hosting dietetic student interns in winter 2015. These students, who have completed their bachelors degrees, fulfill a year-long internship requirement to become a registered dietitian. Dining Services hosts these interns for a sustainability rotation. The interns craft “green eating guides,” which help inform students of meals with smaller environmental impact. Often, the interns focus on the footprint of animal products: they encourage meatless options or suggest opting for a lower carbon-intensive meat, such as eating chicken instead of beef. These green guides will be available for promotion and use in the future.

In 2013-2014, Dining Services began using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Guide to guide seafood selection and procurement. This guide categorizes seafood products as “Best Choices,” “Good Alternatives,” and “Avoid” options. Dining Services uses these guidelines to purchase Best Choice and Good Alternative seafood (seafood farmed or caught in ways that do not cause too much damage to other wildlife and the surrounding habitat). Dining Services also purchases seafood that has been certified sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, the Alaska Seafood Certified Responsible Fisheries, and the Global Aquatic Alliance.

Through collaboration with the Wide Net Project, Dining Services has been able to serve local, sustainable blue catfish in the dining halls. Blue catfish, an invasive species in the Chesapeake Bay, have a mild, sweet flavor. The Maryland Department of Fisheries recommends consuming the blue catfish to control the invasive population. Caught in nets with minimal by-catch, blue catfish are fished sustainably. Not only is the blue catfish local, but serving it on campus also helps to restore the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.",http://dining.umd.edu/nutrition/,6584769.0,2242197.88,55846.66,"University of Maryland Dining Services uses the fall semester to track progress on Sustainable Food goals.
