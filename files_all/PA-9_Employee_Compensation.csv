HR reviewed wages, made a plan to improve BU employee wages – especially those at the lowest levels.  The first steps of a plan were implemented in 2006.  Baylor encouraged its vendors to continue to be cognizant of how they may be able to make change.  It was up to them to decide if and how they could make improvements, based on their business needs and based on what Baylor was able to absorb through pass through costs.  Sustainability goes both ways.  Employers must be able to sustain business operations while also considering how it can help meet employees basic needs.  When the economy crashed in 2008-2009, there was a pause in subsequent steps from this initiative.  We met with our vendors through 2010 reviewing the concept of living wage.  However, through Baylor’s our normal compensation plan efforts to improve staff pay since 2007, progress continued and has impacted those most of those identified as needing improvement toward a “living wage”.   The Baylor Staff Compensation Plan and review processes provide for annual infusions of new and additional funds into staff compensation to provide for, sustain and improve a competitive and fair program.  New infusions are allocated to faculty as well.  Based on Baylor’s generous benefits and intentionally low-cost medical insurance for lower paid staff (where the university subsidizes 92% of the cost for medical insurance for a “gold” plan), and that the university contributes 10.8% of one’s wages/salary to a retirement account without requiring an employee match, that employee only dental benefits are provided at no cost to the employee, that Life and Long Term Disability insurance are provided at no cost to the employee, that free tuition for employees and their dependents at a prominent school (Baylor) is provided, we believe Baylor’s total compensation and benefit plans and policies formally contribute to meeting basic needs.  Baylor is a union-free environment because employees are in effect represented by a caring administration that is committed to the mission of the university which is inclusive of creating and sustaining a desirable working environment.",True,2590.0,--,"$28,260 annual or $13.59/hour represents the federal living wage guideline for a family of four.  The allowable 20% offset of $28,269 is $5,652 annual in the form of employer paid benefits.  This would reduce the underlying hourly pay to $10.87 per hour and when combined with benefits will equal the $28,260 amount for a family of four per the federal living wage guideline. 
Illustration: Employee A at Baylor earns $10.87/hour or $22,615 annually.  For Employee A, Baylor contributes $2,442 to Employee A’s retirement account and contributes $15,096 to Employee A’s cost for medical insurance for a family of four.  Baylor’s contributions for dental insurance for Employee A is another $288.  Therefore, the 20% allowance is vastly offset with Baylor contributions toward one’s basic needs.  At this time, Baylor’s ongoing efforts to improve wages for its 2600 full-time benefit eligible employees has resulted in the number of full-time employees being less than 10 who are below $10.87 per hour.

Administrative Compensation
Each administrative position at Colgate has its own salary range that is determined using data obtained through the annual College and University Professional Association for Human Resources (CUPA-HR) Administrative Salary Surveys. These data are supplemented by other available market data to ensure that the ranges are competitive.

Ranges are also created for positions that are unique to Colgate or for which no external data are available by comparing those positions to other Colgate positions with similar levels of responsibility and scope for which appropriate salary ranges exist.

Technicians Pay Program
The technical staff includes those positions that require specialized knowledge or skills acquired through experience or academic or vocational training such as computer programmers, technicians, and lab assistants.These positions are recruited from local and sometimes regional markets. Wages for technicians are market-based using data collected by a third-party consultant. The survey group includes our reference groups schools (many of these jobs are specific to higher education) as well as several local colleges and employers. The survey data is updated every three to five years and is used to set unique salary ranges for each position.

The technical staff pay system also includes a five-tier title and promotion structure. Merit is incorporated into the system by providing the opportunity for a ""fast-track"" promotion when a supervisor or department makes the case that based on exceptional contributions, learned skills, or taking on significant additional duties, a given technician should be promoted earlier than the five-year interval, but at no more frequent intervals than three years.

Support Staff Career Progression Program
The Support Staff Career Progression Program is designed to provide career growth opportunities to staff members within their current jobs, to identify potential promotional opportunities, as well as to link pay opportunity to what individuals actually do on the job.

The foundation of this program is the Skill and Competency Model. The model establishes an individual's pay opportunity through an assessment of skills and competencies demonstrated on the job.

To ensure Colorado State University provides sustainable pay, the University has instituted a wage floor of $9.31/hour for regular State Classified employees, which exceeds the state minimum wage in Colorado of $8.23/hour (http://www.hrs.colostate.edu/pdfs/state-classified-by-title-FY15.pdf). State Classified Positions are positions classified on the basis of duties and responsibilities to classes described in the State of Colorado Class Descriptions that indicate title, general duties, level of complexity, decision-making, purpose of contact, and line/staff authority. State of Colorado Classified Employment Positions are covered under the State of Colorado’s Annual Compensation Plan and are administered via the Colorado Division of Human Resources (https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dhr/fy-2014-15-annual-compensation-plan).

The second classification of Colorado State University employees, Faculty/Administrative Professionals, is exempt from the State Classified Personnel System. Faculty and Administrative Professional compensation is determined by the University using as guidance market data, primarily from the College and University Personnel Association (http://www.cupahr.org/surveys/fhe4-tenure-surveydata-2014.aspx). The compensation interests of these University employees are represented by the Colorado State University Faculty Council’s Standing Committee of Faculty and Administrative Professionals and its Benefits Committee (http://www.facultycouncil.colostate.edu/files/manual/sectiond.htm#D.1). For a list of policies/guidelines for each employment category at CSU, please visit the HR page: http://www.hrs.colostate.edu/compensation/.  Annual compensation increase guidelines for Faculty/Administrative Professional employees are defined in the Salary Increase Exercise Guidelines  are detailed here (http://www.budgets.colostate.edu/docs%5CSALX%20Guidelines_FY15_2014_05_01.pdf#zoom=100).
",True,8317.0,--,"For pay rates for Faculty and Administrative Professional (categorized as University employees), the University utilizes salary data from organizations such as the College and University Personnel Association to understand market value. Within the AP framework, CSU uses Towers Watson and Mercer data to set an informal compensation standard. Internally, the Office of Equal Opportunity and Institutional Research conduct internal salary equity evaluations for Faculty, Administrative Professional, and State Classified employee groups. Colorado State University also considers the US & Denver/Boulder Consumer Price Index (http://www.ir.colostate.edu/pdf/cpi/CPI_updated_Jan_2015.pdf#zoom=100) as a sustainable compensation standard in the institution’s locality. In FY14, Faculty/Administrative Professional salary increases were set at 3%. In the same year, the US CPI change and the Denver/Boulder CPI change were 1.5% and 2.9% respectively (page 155, 2014-2015 University Fact book, http://www.ir.colostate.edu/pdf/fbk/1415/2014_15_Fact_Book_Employees.pdf).

The University holds the primary compensation guideline/standard, as outlined in the Salary Increase Exercise Guidelines, which state:  “Colorado State University administers an annual process for salary adjustments that are implemented on July 1. Colorado State has a duty and responsibility to treat all employees in a consistent and fair manner relative to salary and benefit administration within the annual salary increase pool. Each unit shall develop a plan that must include a merit-driven process to guide individual salary decisions. While each department and unit must be concerned about consistency, the University must exert an effort to assure that there are no material inconsistencies between department/unit implementation of the salary exercise. Justification for all salary adjustments must be formally documented, and able to withstand independent review (page 3, paragraph 1).”  These internal and external evaluations ensure that there is sustainable compensation across the campus.

However, acknowledging that there can be some debate about a fair level of compensation for lowest paid employees, CSU is in the process of implementing a Navigator Program which explicitly helps our lowest paid employees access more community resources to support them in their efforts for financial security. This program considered the assessments mentioned above, and strives to go beyond them in providing for employees at CSU.

For State Classified employees (categorized as employees of the State of Colorado assigned to work at Colorado State University), compensation is by the State of Colorado via legislation and Colorado State University does not have control of these pay rates. However, State Classified employees at Colorado State University are represented by the Classified Personnel Council , which is a multi-stakeholder representative committee and represents the interests of Colorado State University’s State Classified Employees (http://cpc.colostate.edu/) . Classified Personnel Council hosts a Legislative subcommittee that is charged with advocating for Colorado State’s State Classified employees regarding legislation that has direct impact on the State Classified employee group. Also, the Classified Personnel Council appoints a member to the Statewide Liaison Council, a network of state classified representatives from various higher-education institutions.

FLSA governs compensation in many ways including establishing minimum wage, requiring overtime pay for non-exempt (hourly) employees and establishing pay classifications and accompanying rules on deductions for those classified as exempt (salary) or nonexempt (hourly). 

Elon makes every effort to assure that salaries are competitive with or above those in the community, local industry and among peer institutions. The university has as part of its long range plan, the Elon Commitment, a specific goal aimed at employing a world class faculty and staff. To achieve this goal, the university understands the importance of offering very competitive salaries in order to secure the best employees to move the university forward. In its effort to assure that salaries paid at Elon rank in the top three of the university’s peer institutions, the university has implemented a salary plan that will further increase compensation of faculty and staff in a three-year program that began in December 2013 and concluded with the completion of Phase three on June 1, 2015. The university’s three-year salary initiative provided an additional salary pool each year which targeted employees based on identified salary bands. The salary amounts being paid to employees were divided into three bands – lowest to highest.  The first year of the initiative provided the additional salary pool for those employees who were earning salaries in the lowest band. The second year targeted those employees in the mid-range among all employees, and the third year targeted those employees above the mid-range. This three-year salary initiative was in addition to the university’s annual review process and salary increase pool for employees. 

The university has had a salary increase pool each year unlike many other colleges, universities and businesses which have not provided salary increases for employees. Additionally, there have been no layoffs at Elon despite the economic downturn in the country which began in the fall of 2008. 

To further support the goal of competitive salaries, the university is also completing a review of its current salary ranges to re-establish a minimum, midpoint and maximum annual salary for each pay grade. Elon will again be collaborating with its contracted food service vendor and campus book store vendor requesting that they consider using the same overall minimum salaries for pay ranges so as to maintain alignment with the university’s initiative. Pay ranges are being determined using local, regional and national survey information. More specifically, the university is utilizing the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources’ annual salary survey, the HEITS Salary Survey for employees working in Information Systems positions and numerous state and regional salary surveys of positions at the university that are commonly found in business and industry. Elon has also sought to identify salaries for positions that can be found at other colleges and universities that are considered to be Elon’s peers as well as a number of institutions that the university aspires to be more like. The university has contracted with Willis, Inc. out of Atlanta to assist in the development of its pay range system, and the salary study will be completed in the near future.",--,--,--,,,,,,,--,--,True,--,--

The Graduate School emphasizes to all colleges that an institutional goal is to appoint GAs at no less than a grade 12, and preferably a grade 13 ($18,225 for Fall/Spring for 2013/14).  This is formalized in the Strategic Plan for the Graduate School (draft submitted to the Provost), and colleges are asked to work towards their programs meeting this target.

For Centre County, PA, the location of the University Park campus, which is where the majority of Ph.D. students (who hold the majority of assistantships) are enrolled, a living wage is calculated at $18,469 in 2014  (http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/42027).  For academic year 2013/14, the numerical average stipend amount of all ½-time fall/spring assistantships (93% of all the assistantships are ½-time) was $18,488, and most GAs receive some form of summer support on top of this, so we are on average providing more than a living wage in terms of the stipend plus summer support.

 In addition to the stipend, every assistantship includes full graduate tuition, a university contribution to the GA’s health insurance premium (for individual GAs, the University pays 80% of the premium; for a spouse/partner, the University pays 75% of the premium; and for children the University pays 76% of the premium), and for students appointed to a fall/spring GA, qualifies the student for up to 9 credits of summer tuition at no cost to the graduate student in the subsequent summer.  In addition to the stipend, the value of these other forms of compensation total approximately $54,116 for GAs who are PA-residents, and approximately $71,937 for GAs who are non-PA residents.

Saint Louis University,2016-03-24,2016-03-24 17:16:23,bverhof1@slu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,6124.0,6124.0,True,1.0,--,"Saint Louis University is committed to a compensation administration philosophy which, consistent with its mission as a Catholic Jesuit institution, will provide fairness, internal equity and competitive pay rates for the purposes of attracting, retaining, and motivating employees.

Annually, University administration will review recommendations, taking into consideration competitiveness of the current labor market, availability of labor (especially in critical-skill occupations), turnover data, and """"replacement cost"""" data, and set the institutional pay policy for the coming fiscal year. The pay policy will reflect the market position at which the University wishes to recruit and pay employees based upon organizational objectives and philosophy.

This philosophy is carried out through compensation policies which have been approved by the President's Coordinating Council (PCC).  All Saint Louis University compensation decisions are approved by the shared governance of the PCC which includes the president, vice presidents, and a representative from the following governing bodies of the Faculty Senate, Student Government Association, Staff Advisory Committee, and Council of Academic Deans and Directors.  

To accomplish these goals, the compensation plan:
*Should be structured to help attract and retain the numbers and kinds of employees required to operate the University. 
*Must be reasonably competitive with pay levels and practices that prevail in the various labor markets in which the institution competes. 
*Should help to maintain the University in a reasonably competitive position in its product market. The resulting level of compensation must not place the University in a non-competitive cost situation in which the overall compensation results in tuition, fees, and other charges being too high. 
*Should be designed in such a way that the associated administrative time costs will be reasonable and in proportion to the other priorities and time demands on the University's financial resources and available management time. 
*Must gain employee acceptance. This does not necessarily mean that employees must """"approve"""" pay actions, or that compensation policies and practices are somehow subject to popular vote. It does mean that employees must understand the policies and practices and accept both their concepts and specific actions as being reasonable and impartially administered. 
*Must play a positive role in motivating employees to perform their duties to the best of their abilities and in a manner which supports the achievement of institutional goals. 
*Must gain acceptance by the institution's """"public,"""" which includes, but is not limited to, the Board of Trustees, the government and, to some extent, the general public. 
*Must provide opportunity for employees at every level to achieve their reasonable aspirations in a framework of equity, impartiality, and reasonableness. 

The Saint Louis University compensation structure is market driven and recently underwent a University salary structure redesign with assistance from an outside consultant, pricing all of our salary grades to market driven rates.

According to Statistics Canada, all 4 of Sheridan’s campus fall under the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto. The 2011 census population of the Toronto, CMA was 5,583,064. Therefore, all campuses would be considered to be part of the “500,000 inhabitants or more” category in Table 2 of the Low income cut-offs (1992 base) before tax.

As per Table 2 (Low income cut-offs (1992 base) before tax), the 2011 Low-income cut off for a family of 4 is $43,292.  For a person working 40 hours a week, this yearly wage translates to $20.81 per hour.  AASHE indicates that sustainable compensation should be 120% of the low-income cut off value for a family of 4 (the additional 20% can come in the form of employee benefits).  Therefore, employees without benefits should earn $24.98 ($20.81 x 1.2) in order to be earning a sustainable wage.

Stanford University,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 01:12:01,mbhafer@stanford.edu,2.0,Not Pursuing,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,"Note 001: Sustainable Compensation at Stanford
Stanford University enacts a sustainable compensation policy for all of the institution’s employees and for employees of contractors who work on campus (described in more detail below). Additionally, all of Stanford’s faculty and staff receive sustainable compensation, which is reviewed on an annual basis. Contractors who meet Stanford's living wage criteria/applicability must also follow the living wage guidelines and policies. The applicability is described online:
http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/suppliers/dobusiness/policy_living_wage.html
However, due to shortcomings in the STARS reporting tool, Stanford is not able to earn points for this credit because the university does not centrally track the number of employees of contractors working on campus. Every school/unit could have contractors working on campus at any given time. Because there is no uniform methodology to quantify employees of contractors in Stanford's various departments, the university has been forced to not pursue this credit. In this situation, the absolute requirements of the STARS reporting tool have precluded Stanford from realizing any recognition for its sustainable compensation guidelines and practices. For more information on sustainable compensation at Stanford, please see below.

Note 002: Details on Stanford’s sustainable compensation guidelines and practices
Stanford’s staff compensation philosophy notes:
Stanford University is committed to providing a fair and competitive staff compensation program that will attract, retain and motivate high-performing employees at all levels. The university is also committed to providing a competitive total staff compensation package tied to the application of knowledge and skills, the attainment of individual and group results, and the achievement of organizational goals.  In addition, we recognize that a sound compensation program must comply with all State and Federal laws and regulations governing pay.
The staff compensation program is designed to advance Stanford’s ability to attract and retain top talent and provide maximum flexibility to managers in making compensation decisions that reward performance.  No distinction is made whether an employee is part-time or full-time status.  Lowest paid employees are evaluated to ensure they are not paid below the living wage’s hourly rate. This review is done annually and adjustments are made accordingly if needed.
Stanford University annually assesses its wage and benefits programs for staff and faculty/academic employees using market-based surveys. Stanford’s compensation programs are annually assessed against other higher education institutions, general economic conditions, local pay practices and competitive market survey data as applicable. The university leadership reviews and recommends any adjustments that are to be made to the organizational pay structures and to base pay.  All faculty salaries are approved by the Dean of the School and the Provost.  Salary increases are annually reviewed and are based on performance, applicable compensation policies and budgetary considerations. The two applicable collective bargaining agreements at Stanford are based on negotiations with the respective unions and reflect local competitive pay practices.  
Additionally, since September 1, 2007, Stanford University has recognized the importance of paying a living wage to all service workers at Stanford, whether they are directly employed by Stanford or by contractors.  This consideration is included in the annual staff pay analysis and is reflected in the terms and conditions applicable to vendors doing business with Stanford. Through these guidelines, Stanford seeks to establish minimum pay, access to healthcare benefits, and compensated time off for service workers. These guidelines are not intended to prevent contractors from providing wages and benefits in excess of the minimums created here.
Based on the recommendations of the 2005 Stanford Presidential Advisory Committee on Workplace Policies, University Compensation developed a new classification and pay system for non-academic temporary and casual jobs. The Temporary and Casual (Non-Academic) Employee Compensation System is modeled on the compensation system used for regular staff employees.  The minimum wages are also reviewed annually in keeping with the regular staff employee compensation practices and incorporate the university’s living wage analysis that is utilized for contractors.  Wages are calculated to provide for a higher rate since no benefits are provided to this classification of employee.
Lastly, Stanford maintains an Undergraduate Wage Scale in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section 24 of Stanford’s Administrative Guide. In keeping with the University’s general budget plan, the recommended wage rates have been increased by approximately 2% from 2012-2013 levels. The rate paid for a specific position should be in accordance with the skills and experience needed to perform the job. The minimum suggested wage is $12.85 per hour for Level 1 undergraduate employees.

A Living Wage Standard is included in the agreement.  
The unclassified service consists of faculty, professionals, management/confidential, and graduate assistants. 
Faculty – we conduct a regression analysis each year of our full-time faculty salaries, comparing their salaries with entry Assistant Professors within the specific discipline based on CUPA data.  Years of service and time in rank are also part of the analysis which then results in a predicted salary for each faculty member.  When possible, money was set aside from discretionary pools to correct inequities.
Professionals and Management/Confidential – SUNY System has a schedule of salary ranges assigned to each salary level within the professional staff and within the management/confidential levels.  In addition to that, about eight years ago SUNY Cortland established a compensation plan within those ranges with the help of a consultant, Astron Corporation.   Using position descriptions and salary surveys, positions were placed in job groups and years in title were used to establish predicted salaries.  When possible, money was set aside discretionary pools to correct inequities.   In 2014, we contracted with a new consultant, HR Performance Solutions, to again analyze our positions using position descriptions and salary surveys.  The national index, SUNY peer institute and job description were the basis for this comparison.
Graduate Assistants – In the Fall of 2014, minimum and maximum salaries were established for campus Graduate Assistants.

Compensation packages must encourage recruitment and retention of outstanding faculty, staff and administrators. Stevens should be prepared to pay appropriately for outstanding individuals who add to the intellectual vibrancy of our campus and help to propel the University to higher levels of achievement.

The goal for Stevens is to have an average Total Cash Compensation of faculty [and staff] in the 50th to 60th percentile range of a peer group of comparable national universities as carefully selected by an independent compensation consulting firm. As an alternative, the average base salary of faculty [and staff] should be in the 50th to 60th percentile range of the peer group. It is expected that there may be significant variability in the compensation of individual faculty members based on one’s stature in the profession, excellence and productivity in teaching, research and service, as well as length of service to the University and profession. In recruiting new faculty members, every effort will be made to ensure the compensation packages are competitive relative to those at institutions we compete with.

The objectives stated ... above should be reviewed and, if necessary, revised at least once every three years. As the overall stature and productivity of Stevens improves, either (i) the peer group should be reviewed so that Stevens remains within the middle of the peer group in terms of its stature and ranking, or (ii) the expected average base salary and/or Total Cash Compensation should be increased to a level higher that the current suggested 50th to 60th percentile range of the peer group.",True,845.0,--,Employee compensation was assessed against 120 percent of the national poverty guideline for a family of four.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,8.38,--,--,--,--

The complete text of the law is available on the web at http://www.perb.ca.gov/laws/HEERA.aspx.

The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) is a quasi-judicial administrative agency that is charged with administering the eight collective bargaining statues covering California public employees and conducts representation elections and investigates and makes decisions regarding unfair labor practice charges filed by employees, labor organizations and the university.  

Please visit http://www.perb.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx#PerbsJuristiction1 for more details on the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) and http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/faq.html#2_1  on the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) 

Additionally, HERRA law protects employees from reprisals, discrimination, coercion or interference with their exercise of HEERA rights, including the right to form, join and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations and for the purpose of meeting and conferring over those matters. Employees also have the right to refuse to join employee organizations or to participate in the activities of these organizations. Employees cannot, however, refuse to pay an agency fee (fair share) in lieu of paying membership dues. 

Employees who are managerial or confidential within the meaning of HEERA, and some student employees, are excluded from the law's coverage. Supervisory employees have some rights to union representation under HEERA; however, the law prohibits collective bargaining of supervisors' terms and conditions of employment.

About Collective Bargaining in the University of California System

HEERA gives employees the right to form, join and participate in the activities of employee organizations for the purpose of union representation on matters governing the employer-employee relationship. Employees have the right to refuse to join a union or engage in union activities. However, employees in a recognized bargaining unit who do not want to join the union are still required to pay the “agency fees,” which are discussed in the FAQ’s “Agency Fee” section.

There are fourteen collective bargaining units (CBU) on the UC Merced campus. The current contract for each bargaining unit is available on UCnet http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/bargaining-units/index.html.  HEERA prohibits the University from negotiating directly with represented employees (""direct dealing"") or consulting with any academic, professional or staff advisory group on any matter within the scope of representation.

The Negotiation Process
HEERA requires that in negotiating contracts the parties engage in good faith negotiations to try to resolve their differences and to attempt to achieve a signed contract. In the event the parties cannot reach agreement, HEERA provides intervention through an impasse procedure. This procedure includes mediation and fact-finding. If mediation fails, the mediator can elevate the issues to fact-finding. In the fact-finding process, the parties present their respective positions on the unresolved issues that are designated by law as mandatory subjects of bargaining to a three-member fact-finding panel. The panel issues recommendations for resolving the differences between the parties. At the conclusion of fact-finding, if the parties cannot reach agreement using the fact-finder's recommendations the recommendations become available to the public.
",True,1885.0,--,"The University of California is recognized world-wide for excellence in education and research, and the excellence of its medical enterprise.   The University values maintaining excellence in its compensation programs as an overarching theme in perpetuating its reputation of excellence.  Our Compensation Program Guiding Principles serve as a reference point in designing, delivering, and administering cash compensation programs in relation to other programs to ensure the University fulfills its commitment to employees and obligation to the public at large.   

Guiding Principles

To support program excellence, the University will manage each element of cash compensation as follows:

1. Align our compensation with leading academic research institutions (public and private) as well as national, regional and local organizations with whom the University competes for talent;

2. Align our jobs to the market based on their assigned responsibilities taking into account job scope, accountabilities and value to the University;

3. Build funding of compensation programs into the annual budget process in order to provide for competitive pay and total compensation package alignment;

4. Reinforce a high-performance culture so as to attract, develop, motivate and retain the talent needed for the University’s success;

5. Emphasize total cash compensation by providing cash incentive opportunities, where appropriate, with actual payouts tightly linked to results and accountabilities;

6. Compensate individuals and/or teams for their relative levels of contribution to the success of the University, and where appropriate, making accommodation for individual skills, competencies and credentials  that may be of strategic importance to the University;
 
7. Establish consistent linkage of system-wide programs, systems and processes while accommodating a level of flexibility in administration to allow campuses to operate with relative autonomy within their respective markets;

8. Clearly communicate the value of the University’s compensation philosophy, principles and programs to current and prospective employees.  Given UC’s status as a public institution, the compensation programs must meet the highest standards for transparency and compliance with legal requirements.
","October 1, 2015 the UC system implemented the new Fair Wage/Fair Work plan which will increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour over the course of the three years for UC employees hired to work at least 20 hours a week. The plan affects any UC employee currently hired to work at least 20 hours a week and earning less than the newly created UC minimum wage. It also affects anyone working for a third-party with whom UC contracts for services, for any new contract or contract renewal beginning October 1, 2015.

The Fair Wage/Fair Work plan will take effect beginning this October 2015, and minimum hourly pay will increase in phases as follows:
•	At least $13/hour beginning October 1, 2015
•	At least $14/hour beginning October 1, 2016
•	At least $15/hour beginning October 1, 2017

Additionally, UC Merced Chancellor Leland approved the adoption of a three-year strategy for implementing a new compensation policy for UC Merced.  It is designed to:

1. Attract and retain talent by increasing the average range of market percentile for UC non-represented staff from the current 31% to at least 45%;

2. Achieve greater fairness at UC Merced by addressing salary inequities across the campus within similar job functions and between recent and early hires; and

3. Invest in job functions most critical for achieving campus priorities for Project 2020.
Specifically, the Chancellor has approved an $800,000 down payment for FY 2014-15, which will serve to address the grossest inequities in a range of job functions that senior leadership has determined most critical to achieving UC Merced’s goals by 2020

","The lowest paid faculty at UC Merced are the non-senate lectures.  Lectures and graduate students are each represented by a union, therefore the compensation and benefits are governed by the union contract.  At UC Merced these two appointee groups are paid based on academic-year (nine-month) salary scales/ranges.  The salary scales/ranges are used for all ten campuses and issued by Academic Personnel and Program, Office of the President, at the direction of the President.  General range adjustments to all of the scales are determined through collective bargaining negotiations.  The referenced scales are published online at http://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/compensation/2015-16-academic-salary-scales.html.  The majority of Lecturers are hired at the minimum rate on the scale, with incremental increases in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement.  While specifics of the benefit packages for these two groups is also negotiated, basically the academic appointee benefits package depends on the length of the individual’s appointment, the appointment type, and the appointment percentage (number of hours to be worked).

The Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) is the state law that authorizes and regulates collective bargaining between the University of California and the labor organizations that represent UC employees. The complete text of the law is available on the web at http://www.perb.ca.gov/laws/HEERA.aspx.
The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) administers HEERA. PERB conducts representation elections and investigates and makes decisions regarding Unfair Labor Practice charges filed by employees, labor organizations and the University.

The law protects employees from reprisals, discrimination, coercion or interference with their exercise of HEERA rights, including the right to form, join and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations and for the purpose of meeting and conferring over those matters. Employees also have the right to refuse to join employee organizations or to participate in the activities of these organizations. Employees cannot, however, refuse to pay an agency fee (fair share) in lieu of paying membership dues.

Employees who are managerial or confidential within the meaning of HEERA, and some student employees, are excluded from the law's coverage. Supervisory employees have some rights to union representation under HEERA; however, the law prohibits collective bargaining of supervisors' terms and conditions of employment.

History of Collective Bargaining at UC

Under HEERA, a bargaining unit is a group of titles with a sufficient ""community of interest"" (e.g. similar working environment, occupational category, level of education) that a union can reasonably represent the employees in the unit - particularly the negotiation of the employees' terms and conditions of employment.

After the enactment of HEERA in 1979, PERB made a number of determinations about appropriate units at the University of California and conducted representation elections. The current contract for each bargaining unit is available on UCnet (link is external). HEERA prohibits the University from negotiating directly with represented employees (""direct dealing"") or consulting with any academic, professional or staff advisory group on any matter within the scope of representation.

The Negotiation Process


HEERA requires that in negotiating contracts the parties engage in good faith negotiations to try to resolve their differences and to attempt to achieve a signed contract. In the event the parties cannot reach agreement, HEERA provides intervention through an impasse procedure. This procedure includes mediation and fact-finding. If mediation fails, the mediator can elevate the issues to fact-finding. In the fact-finding process, the parties present their respective positions on the unresolved issues that are designated by law as mandatory subjects of bargaining to a three-member fact-finding panel. The panel issues recommendations for resolving the differences between the parties. At the conclusion of fact-finding, if the parties cannot reach agreement using the fact-finder's recommendations the recommendations become available to the public.

","At UCSC, most payroll titles are assigned either a grade or a step scale. Graded titles have a minimum and a maximum rate and employees can be paid anywhere within the range. Titles with a step scale (ie. step 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.) have a succession of steps, beginning with step 1.0 and ending with a negotiated maximum step (differs between titles). 
Generally speaking, positions in the Professional and Support Staff (PSS) program and the Managers and Senior Professionals (MSP) program are assigned a salary grade,

The Institution also reviewed the physical plant staff and increased wages to be competitive with the surrounding community.
Administrative staff compensation is reviewed against national CUPA data.
Faculty compensation is reviewed against national AAUP data.

All open positions are evaluated against competitive peer and aspirant institutions; as well as the local labor market.

",True,481.0,60.0,"For our support staff we recently underwent a complete assessment with an outside consultant and compared our positions through professional compensation surveys of northeastern Ohio employers. Our faculty and administrative staff are evaluated against CUPA data.

Administrative pay:

As part of the process to determine the pay for any new administrative staff member the following process is used:
•         The position is brought before the entire President Council to determine if the position will be replaced.
•         Once the position is approved, the HR department will utilize the data-on-demand tool of the College and University Association Salary survey, published annually. (CUPA)
o   Data-on-demand is a tool to request data on a list of specific institutions as related to a specific administrative (even faculty) position.
  For instance, Mount Union has a list of approximately 20 peer and aspirant institutions, I log-in to the secure CUPA salary survey website, indicate the position I would like to have assessed against our list of peer and aspirant institutions, I indicate that I would like to have data related to the minimum dollar amount paid to the incumbent in the position, the medium and the highest salary paid. I also request longevity in the position.
•         This information is analyzed against the wage of the current incumbent and others at the institution in similar positions, to ascertain the appropriate starting wage. (there are times that the new hire is paid at or higher than the former incumbent.)
•          The practice of Mount Union is to pay at or above the 60th percentile of similar positions at our peer and aspirant institutions. 

Evaluation of pay in times of institutional raises:

•         Each VP is given a spreadsheet of the wages of their entire staff.
•         HR performs a data-on-demand assessment of each position within the VP’s area to determine if any substantial wage movement has happened in the area over the past 12 months in the positions they are responsible to oversee.
•         Wages are then adjusted to either match the 60th percentile of the CUPA wage information or the VP has to provide performance related examples of why the person should not receive a larger then annual cost of living wage increase.

The University of North Carolina at Greensboro’s compensation philosophy is committed to the creation of an inclusive, collaborative, and responsive university by attracting, retaining, and developing a diverse community of talented individuals in support of the university's mission. As a public research university, UNCG must govern its resources in an efficient and effective way. Within the boundaries of financial feasibility, employee compensation will be administered in a manner that is externally competitive and internally equitable, recognizes performance, and includes, but is not limited to consideration of job independence and discretion, job complexity, scope, supervisory or lead roles, relevant experience and credentials, and additional position responsibilities.

COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES
Administering compensation to reflect this philosophy means that:
 Salaries will be reviewed on an on-going basis by the University. These analyses will
support the institution's efforts to obtain appropriate salary funding from the state
legislature. As funding permits, salary increases shall focus on maintaining market
alignment, supporting internal equity, retaining key personnel, and recognizing
performance.
 Within the parameters of discipline, function, job-related experience, and performance,
and individual effectiveness, employees shall be paid similarly for similar work.
 Salaries for new employees should be established at levels that recognize the individual's skills, competencies, and experience while considering the salary levels of current employees with similar job duties.

Further, UNCG ensures that contracts are closely monitored to ensure that proper compensation guidelines and policies are included.

The UNCG compensation standard has been adopted by the University's Executive Staff, which consists of stakeholders from all divisions including the Provost's Office, Student Affairs, Business Affairs, Information Technology Services, and Advancement. This standard has been reviewed and updated on an annual basis to adjust to market conditions. It represents an ongoing effort to recruit high quality talent, maintain market competitiveness, and ensure retention of faculty and staff in support of the university's educational mission. In addition, the University is conducting ongoing equity reviews to address compression, compensation for similarly situated positions, and strategies to address the living wage. A major initiative to create a career ladder program for housekeeping and grounds workers is underway with a projected implementation date of July 1, 2015.

SPA employees are compensated within the guidelines of Career Banding established by the Office of State Human Resources, and pay is based on the following factors: 
i. Financial Resources -The amount of funding that a manager has available when making pay decisions. Agency business need (budget)
ii. Appropriate Market Rate - The market rate applicable to the functional competencies demonstrated by the employee.
iii. Internal Pay Alignment (equity) - The consistent alignment of salaries among employees who demonstrate similar required competencies in the same banded class within a work unit or organization.
iv. Required Competencies - The functional competencies and associated levels that are required based on organizational business need and subsequently demonstrated on the job by the employee.

Salaries paid to faculty members are set by the Office of the Provost and is based on peer data in accordance with University policy. 

Salary ranges for deans are set by the Office of the Provost and is based on discipline, national peer data, and CUPA-HR data for the BOG approved peer institutions. Requests for salary exceptions are forwarded with recommendations from the Chancellor and the President to the BOG Committee on Personnel and Tenure. 

Senior Academic and Administrative Officers (SAAO) with a Tier I status - salaries must be set within ranges authorized by the Board of Governors.
 
For both SAAO Tier I and II administrators, and EPA Non-faculty Professionals, employee compensation will be administered in a manner that is externally competitive and internally equitable, recognizing performance, and includes, but is not limited to consideration of job independence and discretion, job complexity, scope, supervisory or lead roles, relevant experience and credentials, and additional position responsibilities.

•	Grounds and Housekeeping staff. The Associate Vice Chancellor for Facilities Operations is looking to create career ladders and operational efficiencies among our lowest paid employees.

A special provision of FLSA for public agency employers like USF allows use of compensatory time off at a rate of not less than one and one-half hours for each overtime hour worked instead of cash overtime pay.
Every Staff and Administration job at USF has a position description which includes its formal title, department, primary purpose, essential functions, qualifications, and other significant characteristics. In the classification process, a position description is prepared by a supervisor or manager, reviewed by administrators, and submitted to HR where it is associated with a formal job classification.

Every new job is assigned a position number and classified by HR before it is filled. When duties change significantly, jobs are reclassified by HR. During the classification process, the exemption status under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act is also evaluated. Therefore, evaluation of sustainable wages is ongoing.

Although USF requires that contractors comply with the Davis-Bacon Act, the university does not evaluate the wages and benefits policies and guidelines for the employees of contractors operating on campus.

Employees had not received across the board increases in several years due to reduction in state funding and the economic recession. This year, when resources were available, the lowest paid workers received a higher percentage increase than the more highly compensated employees to ensure a more sustainable wage. In addition, benefits, both individual and family, have been provided for all employees working over 30 hours per week effective January 1, 2014.

The following is our current language: 
In accordance with the compensation philosophy the support staff and administrative staff salary programs are reviewed regularly to assure that they remain competitive with the appropriate labor market. Jobs are compared with a designated group of peer colleges and universities, similar jobs in a geographic area, or with organizations with similar functions.

The Office of Human Resources reviews the salary structure annually to determine how inflation and the influence of the various labor markets have impacted salaries. Input from department heads concerning the competitive environment of specific professions is solicited. Information about other organizations is gathered through salary surveys. Decisions to revise a salary structure are based on external market conditions and the College's operating circumstances.

Market competitiveness:
""Benchmark"" jobs are those that have a comparable job in the labor market with reliable survey data. These jobs form the anchor of the salary structure, and are identified based on individual department and institutional survey data. Human Resources reviews selected jobs annually.

Those jobs that do not have comparable jobs in the labor market are slotted in relationship to benchmark jobs based on similar functions and responsibilities."
