First, there is a Delicate Balance poster symposium at the end of every semester that takes place in the student center. A majority of
the residents on campus walk through the poster session. Second, after the class is over, the final reports and abstracts are put into a database that is available under the My GMC webportal that the campus uses for logistics. Staff interested in a project can view the abstracts and request more information from the administrator in the Dean's Office. New Delicate Balance students in future semesters can also view the abstracts to help get project ideas. Additionally, staff and faculty may add project ideas to the database so that future students may decide to take them on.

Healthy Food Transition:
The goal of this transition is to re-evaluate the Hampshire College farm center, dining services, and land use. This section of the website provides information about the ongoing process of transforming campus dining services. It also highlights the 210-member Hampshire Farm Center Community Supported Agriculture program; Mixed-Nuts, the student-run food co-op; the summer Food, Farm, and Sustainability Institute; and a National Science Foundation grant awarded to professors Jason Tor and Chris Jarvis to develop curriculum around food fermentation.

Sustainable Operations Transition: 
The goal of this transition is to reduce the college’s environmental footprint and costs, and manage the campus and the built environment as both laboratory and classroom. This section of the website provides information about on-going operations sustainability initiatives, such as the climate action plan; the Zip-Car program; installation of a roof-top solar-canopy with 2,880 square feet of photovoltaic modules; fundraising for renovation to achieve LEED certification of the building housing the indoor sports center and café; collaboration with the Hitchcock center to explore sites on campus to build a state-of-the-art environmental education center; participation in the Five College Blue Sky Sustainability Initiative; and the sustainability revolving fund, which provides loans for campus improvement projects that benefit Hampshire’s sustainability by improving efficiency and conserving resources. This website also offers tips for reducing environmental impacts in campus offices. 

Creative Curriculum Transition:
The goal of this transition is to provide Hampshire's extraordinary faculty and intrepid students time and resources to develop and experiment with courses and projects that spark discovery and solve problems in the connections among mind, art, science, health, enterprise, and social change in the anthropocene era, and challenge students in every discipline to consider their role in human survival.

Engineering Building
Epler Hall
One of the goals of Epler was to make stormwater management interesting and engaging for the public. As a result, the system was designed to be visible and interactive. The ""show"" starts when it begins to rain. Rain falling on the roof is directed to several river-rock ""splash boxes"" in the public plaza. From there, water travels through channels between the brick pavers in the plaza to several planter boxes. The water is filtered as it passes through the planters before entering a large underground storage tank. The water from this tank is then treated with UV light before returning to the surface for use in the public toilets and irrigation. Epler's stormwater harvesting system was awarded a $15,000 Emerging Technology Grant from the City of Portland Office of Sustainable Development's G/Rated Program. It reduces the building's need for municipally-treated potable water by approximately 110,000 gallons annually, saving PSU roughly $1,000 each year.

Shattuck Hall
PSU Project Manager: Jennifer Sharp, Facilities and Planning
Design: SRG Partnership
Construction Management/General Contractor: Howard S. Wright Construction Company
Funding: $13.7 million in State Authorized Deferred Maintenance Funding

The renovation and upgrade of seismic, heating and cooling, electrical, plumbing and communications systems in Shattuck Hall have been completed and the 95 year old building that originally served as an elementary school is now home to ten general classrooms, the Department of Architecture, a computer lab, wood and metal shops, a fine-art foundry, and the Campus Public Safety Office (CPSO). The very successful deferred maintenance project is an inspiration for future PSU and State of Oregon projects, especially with its potential for achieving Gold LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council. Fitting features for Shattuck Hall, also the home of PSU’s Department of Architecture, include spaces where the inner-workings of building systems are visible by design giving students actual working examples of innovative construction elements and remodeled components.

Campus Loop
PSU Project Manager: Mark Fujii, Facilities and Planning
Design: Winzler and Kelly
Construction Management/General Contractor: Fortis Construction
Funding: $17.5 million in State Economic Stimulus Funds

Building upon the work completed in Phase I, Phase II of the Campus Steam & Chilled Water Loop will further expand and connect partially networked and stand-alone heating and cooling systems into centralized plants and add emergency power backup for essential operations. The project is scheduled for completion by end of August 2010.
- Science 2 to Millar Library and Millar Library to the East and to the West Heating Plants: replacement of and addition of new runs to connecting the campus buildings to the network of steam, condensate return and chilled water piping.
- Science 2 to Cramer Hall: installation of chilled water piping to connect the two central cooling plants housed in Science 2 and Cramer Hall.
- Peter W. Stott Center to Shattuck Hall: construction of a new tunnel completing the steam and chilled water loop that connects the core buildings surrounding the South Park Blocks. The construction of this tunnel will also serve as a future distribution point the inclusion of campus buildings on the eastside of SW Broadway Avenue.
- Science 2: installation of a new chiller and cooling tower that will add capacity to allow for future planned buildings and expansions.
- Cramer Hall and University Service Building: installation of backup generators in each building to provide emergency power to the campus buildings where uninterrupted service is essential. 

Each of these installation areas also has an educational sign to show the location of campus loop infrastructure, its cost, and what the end results of upgrades will be.

Science Research and Teaching Center (SRTC)
PSU Project Manager: Mark Fujii, Facilities and Planning
Design: IDC Architects (Division of CH2M Hill)
Construction Management/General Contractor: Hoffman Construction
Funding: $26.3 million in State Deferred Maintenance Funds and $19 million in State General Funds, Bonds, Federal Funds, and Economic Stimulus Funds.

This project is a combination of SRTC building infrastructure upgrades and the expansion and modernization of labs and teaching space resulting in the Science and Research Teaching Center. Included in the infrastructure improvements are seismic and code upgrades, electrical, plumbing and HVAC upgrades. Included in the modernization improvements are expansions and remodeling of labs and teaching space, and the addition of a new hazardous waste handling facility. Completion of the project is targeted for May of 2011.

There are multiple locations for finding green building features information. We are working to consolidate this information so it is more accessible to students, staff, faculty, and the community.

Nineteen students volunteered to live in the Green LLC this last year, opting for an eco-conscious stay while studying at USF. 2011 marks the third year that the Green LLC has been operating and it is thriving now more than ever.

“The second year, and this year, the students are more engaged and want to be involved with some green projects and issues on campus.” said Elizabeth Kaplon the Program Director, Housing & Residential Education.

According to Kaplon, ""about 40-50% of the Green LLC residents are Environmental Science majors and almost all of them had participated in some green causes in high school or in their community prior to coming to college.""

To assist students in their efforts, the housing staff staged an eco-friendly room that showed students how to make eco-conscious choices about the items they placed in their dorms.  Please see:

The Environmental Management and Business Institute (EMBI) was established in August 2008, and helps strengthen the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay’s leadership position in the promotion of environmental awareness and eco-friendly initiatives. 

A primary mission of the EMBI is to host an annual conference that joins the University, local businesses and community leaders to work toward the realization of a sustainable future. The annual conference is called Green Innovations, and features international experts and local panelists who can provide insight on important topics such as sustainability in transportation, wind energy, regional health, regional sustainability and water management.

The establishment of EMBI is a step in the evolution of UW-Green Bay’s historic mission of studying environmental issues and developing solutions to problems; solutions that recognize the critical interconnections between science, policy and business, and the social contexts within which they occur.

The EMBI will strive to work with public- and private-sector partners throughout the New North region to make the region synonymous with sustainability and environmental leadership. Helping businesses develop opportunities to reduce their environmental impact while increasing profitability is good for business. Today’s public view has evolved to where “good business” is not only profitable, but is also recognized for good stewardship of the environment.

In April 2013, the annual Green Innovations conference will be held with the themes of Urban Agriculture and Community Sustainability, with Dr. David Orr as the keynote presenter.This conference brings together faculty, students, business and government leaders to learn from each other. The schedule of events for the 2013 conference can be reviewed at the website URL.
