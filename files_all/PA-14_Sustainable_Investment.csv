The ASU Foundation aligns itself with the university’s long-standing reputation and mission to serve as a national model for commitment to sustainability and environmentally responsible practices. The Foundation’s investment committee has proactively investigated and deliberated on the topic of SRI for many years.

The ASU Foundation and the university it serves are committed to taking a leadership role in addressing issues that pose a threat to our global community. Climate change and broader sustainability concerns represent significant risks and opportunities to investment portfolios and the ASU Foundation will continue to actively investigate strategies that best serve all needs. 

The ASU Foundation’s attention to SRI resonates beyond the board room: in January 2015, the Foundation partnered with the Intentional Endowments Network to host the Intentionally Designed Endowment Forum: Aligning Investment Portfolios with Institutional Mission, Values, and Sustainability Goals. Recognizing the increasing importance of this topic to students, faculty, donors, and other stakeholders, the foundation and its partner convened more than 100 higher education presidents, business officers, trustees, endowment portfolio managers, private foundation officers, and others in an unprecedented forum to address how endowments can be positioned to support higher education in creating a more just, healthy, and sustainable society. 

In keeping with the ASU Foundation’s mission to support the success of Arizona State University, endowment returns support a wide range of ASU’s programs, scholarships, and research, including the innumerable activities that reflect ASU's university-wide commitment to sustainability and environmentally responsible topics. Further, the foundation seeks philanthropic partners to join us in this arena, most notably Julie Ann Wrigley, whose $50 million in gifts helped create the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability.

STATEMENT OF INVESTMENT BELIEFS
February 21, 2013
The Clarkson University Values Statement includes a description of “Vision”:  Having a vision of a sustainable future helps us prepare for it.  Embracing the inevitable changes in our world as opportunities allows us to anticipate, promote, and facilitate change.
Our investment strategy will seek to embody this value by taking account of the relationship between 1) good environmental management, 2) sensitivity to social issues, and 3) and strong corporate governance; and long-term sustainable business profitability.  We will seek to overlay this strategy across our investment portfolio.  Our main influence will be through our strategic asset allocation, manager structure, manager selection, performance benchmarks, monitoring, and reporting – and not by getting involved in the day-to-day investment decisions, which is the role of our asset managers. 
We will favor investing on a positive “best in class” selection basis, and encourage the use of engagement rather than negative screening.
We believe companies with strong environmental, social, and governance profiles are better managed for the long term, have lower risk profiles, and are positioned to outperform their peers.  We engage indirectly through allocating capital to investment managers who invest with companies and sectors with positive economic, ecological, and social impact.
We will consider environmental impact, social justice, and corporate governance issues as we cast our proxy votes.

Preamble
The Board of Trustees recognizes that Duke University’s ability to meet its educational mission and financial goals requires enhancing the value of the endowment over the long term by investing in companies that achieve real growth. It also recognizes the importance of ethical practices. A mechanism is necessary to assist the President in making recommendations to the Board of Trustees in keeping with the Board’s Guideline on Socially Responsible Investing, which is attached. The committee described below provides such a mechanism.
Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility (ACIR)
The Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility is a University body advisory to the President with the following functions:
a. Receive issues referred to it by members of the Duke community;
b. Monitor trends and activities in investment responsibility that have an impact on educational institutional investors;
c. Conduct research, update Duke’s files on companies, and provide analyses when requested by the President;
d. Make recommendations to the President on how to vote proxies when the committee believes proxies should be voted outside the standard protocol of “economic interest;” whether to sponsor shareholder resolutions; whether to correspond with the management of corporations in which the University holds an identifiable equity position; when to divest; and on any new issues, which may warrant attention.
ACIR Membership
The Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility shall include fourteen voting members: one trustee, two undergraduate and two graduate or professional students nominated respectively by the Duke Student Government and Graduate and Professional Student Council, one alumnus nominated by the Duke University Alumni Association, four faculty members nominated by the Academic Council, the University Counsel or his or her delegate, the Deputy Treasurer or his or her delegate, and two administrative appointees chosen by the President. Each representative body will be asked to nominate two individuals for each position and the President will select who will be invited to serve; the Board of Trustees will elect the trustee member of the committee.
Members shall be appointed for at least two years and may be reappointed, serving until their successors take office.
The ACIR Chair shall be appointed by the President from among the voting members.
￼￼￼
ACIR Organization
The ACIR shall meet on a regular basis and on the call of the Chair.
The ACIR may ask individuals, from within the University or outside of it, to attend its meetings as consultants or otherwise provide advice and information.
To assist in its review of social responsibility proxy issues, the ACIR will have confidential access to data compiled by or on behalf of the University on companies the securities of which are held directly by the University and on fund managers. It is understood that certain pooled or commingled investment vehicles may not permit the degree of disclosure possible for direct holdings.
ACIR Operations
The ACIR shall examine issues of investment responsibility involving the University’s endowment securities and propose to the President recommendations for action by the Trustees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the following factors: (1) the facts and information the ACIR has gathered in its study of the issues; (2) whether the offending firm’s culpability is substantial and proven; (3) the opinions expressed within the Duke community regarding the issues, including the degree of consensus; and (4) the legal and financial impact of the recommended action on the companies in question.
The Chair is responsible for setting agendas.
An annual report published by the ACIR will inform the University community of the issues examined, recommendations made by the ACIR, and the disposition by the President’s office and the Board of Trustees. The committee will also maintain a public website to provide information about its activities to the Duke community. It may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage the convening of occasional public meetings or forums of the Duke community to assess the views of members of the community.
In considering an allegation of substantial social injury, the ACIR shall investigate and analyze the allegation in whatever manner it deems appropriate and may then make a recommendation to the President, provided that the recommendation is first approved by the majority of the ACIR’s members. Recommendations may call for voting Duke’s shares in shareholder resolutions, making representations to management, divestment of securities, or other action as the ACIR deems appropriate.
The ACIR shall make its recommendation in writing to the President. The recommendation shall be accompanied by factual findings and an analysis of the question involved. Voting members of the ACIR who hold dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing with the ACIR’s recommendation.
Where the ACIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a proxy or divestment issue, the President will, where practicable, await a timely recommendation from the ACIR before taking action.
The President will make decisions on all recommendations for action under this policy.
￼￼2
Role of the President
The President will review the analysis and recommendation of the ACIR and, if he or she concurs, will forward a recommendation to the Board of Trustees.
If the President chooses not to forward the ACIR’s recommendation to the Board of Trustees, he or she will explain his or her decision in writing to the ACIR.
￼3
Guideline on Socially Responsible Investing August 20, 2004
To fulfill its educational and humanitarian purposes, Duke University must manage its investment assets wisely. Thus the primary fiduciary responsibility of the Board of Trustees in overseeing the management of the University’s investment assets must be to maximize the financial return on those resources, taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for the University.
At the same time, the University wishes to be a good corporate citizen and a responsible and ethical investor. The authority of its Board of Trustees to take ethical factors into account when setting investment policies and practices derives from the very stewardship responsibilities which attend the ownership of endowment securities. We recognize that sometimes a corporation’s policies or practices can cause substantial social injury—that they may have a gravely injurious impact on employees, consumers, and/or other individuals or groups that results from specific actions by a company. For example, corporate actions may violate domestic or international laws intended to protect individuals and/or groups against deprivation of health, safety, or civil, political, and human rights.
Thus for investments not governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), when the Board of Trustees judges that corporate policies or practices cause substantial social injury, it will give weight to this factor in investment practices related to corporate securities.
Actions the University takes may or may not materially affect an offending corporation, but such actions may have significant symbolic value. When the University community has engaged in substantive discourse on an issue and expressed broad concern that substantial social injury is being caused by such policies or practices, the president may make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees.
Where the Board of Trustees finds that a company’s activities or policies cause substantial social injury, and that a desired change in the company’s activities would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such injury, it may instruct the Duke University Management Company (DUMAC) to take appropriate action, including the exercise of the University’s practicable shareholder rights to seek modification of the company’s activities to eliminate or reduce the injury, using such means as
a) direct correspondence with management
b) proxy votes
c) sponsoring shareholder resolutions.
If the Board of Trustees further concludes that the company has been afforded reasonable opportunity to alter its activities, and that divestment will not impair the capacity of the University to carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing significant adverse action on the part of governmental agencies), then it may instruct DUMAC and its managers to divest the securities in question within a reasonable period of time.

3. Collaboration—work with global investors and endowments to develop and define sustainable investment best practices.

The $291 million invested in businesses selected for exemplary sustainability performance primarily comprises LEED-certified real estate investments. ",True,,"The fundamental goal of the University’s investment strategy is, and has been, “to maximize the total long-term return on investments” in order to support the University’s core mission of teaching and research. However, the guidelines reflect the Trustees’ belief that it is appropriate to consider investment-driven social responsibility issues in certain limited circumstances. While these guidelines were designed with investment issues in mind, the introduction to the guidelines suggests that they “can be applied more generally in order to help us consider other kinds of social responsibility issues more efficiently.”

The guidelines state clearly: “There is a strong presumption against the University taking a political position or playing an active role with respect to external issues of a political, social, or moral character.” The Resources Committee has the responsibility to determine when the strong presumption not to take a position regarding issues of broader social concern must be tempered by other considerations. The 1997 guidelines contain criteria for considering exemptions from the presumption and reflect the view that exceptions from maximizing return should be considered in limited circumstances.

The key criterion is that there be “considerable, thoughtful, and sustained campus interest” and note that the appropriate level of interest may require repeated raising of the issue over an extended period of time.” The Resources Committee must also consider the “magnitude, scope, and representativeness of campus opinions.” A link to the guidelines and criteria for considering exemptions can be found below.",True,"When the Resources Committee, based on the guidelines outlined above and linked below, decides that it is necessary to place a social or environmental overlay on investment decisions, it makes a recommendation to the University’s Trustees. Upon approval by the Trustees, PRINCO makes any necessary changes to its small amount of direct holdings and communicates the restriction to its external managers. 

The most recent example of such a scenario is the Endowment’s divestment from Sudan. In the fall of 2005, the Resources Committee turned its attention to Sudan and conducted a thorough review of the political and economic climate in Sudan, as well as actions taken by other institutions. The Committee found that action by Princeton regarding current or contemplated investment in selected companies conducting business in Sudan was necessary. Ultimately, the Resources Committee proposed that the University divest from assets directly held in any company actively conducting operations in Sudan that supports acts of genocide or renders assistance to perpetrators of genocide. For any such companies held directly by the Endowment, the Committee recommended that the University first engage these companies in dialogue and divest if those efforts failed. For Princeton’s external managers, the Committee recommended that PRINCO request a report on ownership of these companies, suggest that the managers give careful consideration to Princeton’s concerns, and ask for comments on Princeton’s decision. In June 2006, the University’s Board of Trustees adopted this policy of disassociation.",True,"As described above, the Endowment has maintained a negative screen against assets directly held in any company directly or indirectly involved in genocide in Sudan since 2006.

Where it has decided upon such a guideline, the University’s Statement on Investment Responsibility directs that the University will “normally vote according to existing University Investment Responsibility Proxy Voting Guidelines.” For example, Stanford has been active since 1998 in implementing a climate change guideline that states the following, “Stanford votes ‘Yes’ on resolutions that companies analyze levels of greenhouse gas emissions, develop action plans to reduce them, report on significant company actions to remediate, reduce and/or eliminate them, and continually assess and report on material impacts caused by company action and/or inaction with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.” 

Stanford has also adopted policies which preclude owning securities in specific companies with operations in apartheid South Africa and Sudan, as well as companies in the tobacco industry.  In each case the action was based on fiduciary obligations and clear ethical principles which were widely held across the entire Stanford community.

In May 2014, as a result of the APIRL process, Stanford announced that it would divest of direct holdings in publicly traded companies whose principal business is the mining of coal for use in energy generation; would avoid such direct holdings in the future; and would recommend that its external investment managers similarly divest of such holdings.
",--,"Coal - Acting on a recommendation of Stanford's Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility and Licensing, the Board of Trustees announced on May 6, 2014 that Stanford will not make direct investments in coal extraction companies. 

Tobacco – During the 1990s, the APIRL focused on the issue of health risks and illegal sales and marketing of tobacco products to minors.  Stanford implemented many proxy voting guidelines and engaged corporations in an effort to end injuries caused by company products.  In 1998, Stanford ended investment in core tobacco companies.

Human Rights – For more than four decades, the University has continued to address allegations of human rights abuses and the part corporations played by direct or indirect action or inaction, including Apartheid South Africa and Sudan.

In 2014 the University of California adopted a proactive sustainable investment strategy that will integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a core component of portfolio management. Including the measures listed below.  - Establish and Implement a framework on sustainable investment 
- Integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors as a core component of portfolio optimization and risk management and will evaluate all strategies for achieving ESG goals as soon as practical, including whether to use divestment.
- Allocate $1 billion over a 5-year period to solutions-oriented investments such as renewable power and fuels, energy efficiency, and /or sustainable food and agriculture.

This strategy builds on pre-2014 investment policy that addresses negative screens for ESG factors.

The world is changing and investors must keep abreast of how growing awareness of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks spreads rapidly via social and other media to influence markets. At the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents (OCIO) we believe ESG risks can present opportunities and that addressing these factors is in line with our fiduciary duty.

Some of our stakeholders have voiced concerns regarding the impact ESG risks could have on the future growth of our endowment and retirement funds. We have listened carefully to these concerns through meetings, one-on-one encounters and written exchanges. Based on this stakeholder engagement, as well as extensive research on ESG risks and opportunities, we agree that certain material ESG factors will increasingly become a focus of risk assessment for long-term value creation in the years to come. We continue to actively study how our peers and fund managers are improving measurement of these variables for integration into investment decision-making and are working to bring ESG evaluation more holistically into our investment culture.

There are key ESG risks that are driving new economic and financial trends and that can guide our investment decisions and fund manager selection and monitoring. This list is not intended to be static, but represents important core universal principles we keep in mind as we aim to ensure the best return on investments for our university and its many stakeholders.

These principles include the following trends and considerations:

    Climate Change: Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system.[1] A transition to a lower carbon economy, including low carbon sources of energy, is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of future generations. Given the scale of existing infrastructure and the challenge of quickly shifting the transportation sector to low carbon fuel sources, this transition requires a multi-generational effort.
    Inequality: Addressing inequality is not only a responsibility but also an opportunity.[2] Solving inequality of opportunity can create new demographics that can contribute to economic progress and widen the market for goods and services, thereby creating a more profitable and sustainable business climate.
    Human Rights: Businesses whose profits are derived from direct harm to public safety, the unlawful deprivation of human dignity, or the exploitation of children or other vulnerable workers undermine universally approved United Nations principles and create a serious threat to the conditions needed for a well-functioning, market-based global system.
    Food and Water Security: Global climate change, population growth and rapid urbanization are intensifying the strain on global water and agricultural systems. Human well-being is inexorably linked to water and food security, and failure to adequately ensure these basic needs for future generations will undermine global economic welfare, human security and political stability.
    Diversity: Diversity enhances economic, social and environmental outcomes for business and society.
    Ageing Population: Rapid aging of populations will be a transformational force affecting society and the global economy, requiring new approaches to health systems, workforce organization, intergenerational relations and public finance.
    Circular Economy: The “take, make, dispose” pattern of growth is an unsustainable economic paradigm. We must transition to a more circular economy in which intelligent design allows us to decouple economic growth and development from consumption of finite resources.
    Ethics and Governance: Our market economy system relies on trust as a fundamental cornerstone. Good corporate governance and proportionate, transparent and responsible regulation are vital to well-functioning and sustainable financial markets. As long-term investors, we seek the sustained returns associated with strong governance, rather than the rapid gains that can vanish quickly if they are rooted in corruption, fraud or falsification. Recent financial crises highlight how destructive such fraud and corruption can be to the proper functioning of credit markets and the preservation of personal and corporate wealth.

Since 2010, UWOF has invested more than $10 million in three sustainability-related projects. 

The first effort involves a $3.7 million investment matched with $1.3 million in grants for a total project cost about $5 million to construct the first commercial scale dry fermentation anaerobic biodigester in the Americas. This facility converts food, yard and other organic waste into biogas, which is burned to generate electricity. The feed-stock includes most of the food waste from UW Oshkosh (500 tons per year), food waste from area grocery stores and many suppliers from off campus. The plant presently processes some 10,000 tons of organic wastes annually and generates the equivalent of nearly 8% equivalent of campus electricity needs. If operated at full capacity the 320 kW turbine would generate about 2.8 million kW hours of electricity annually, or the equivalent of 13% percent of campus electricity needs at present levels of demand. An additional amount of heat energy will soon heat the Facility Services building at UW Oshkosh.  The digestate is being processed into high quality organic compost and is currently being sold to the community.

The value of the second investment stands at $7 million. This investment was used to construct a wet anaerobic digester on Wisconsin’s largest dairy farm in Rosendale. The facility began operating in December 2013. It will process 110,000 tons of manure from more than 8,000 cows to generate 12.3 million kW hours of electricity annually from a 1.4 megawatt turbine. Waste heat is now warming barns on the farm. The digestate from this facility will be processed into a high quality compost soil amendment. Carbon credits will be offered in the near future.

The third investment was made as a community redevelopment project in a blighted part of Oshkosh. Specifically, UWOF has invested more than $1.1 million dollars as a partner in a $16.7 million hotel renovation project that is centrally located along the city’s downtown riverfront redevelopment initiative. The hotel has been open for few years now and already has a significant and visible presence along Oshkosh’s Riverwalk.

WARREN WILSON COLLEGE ENDOWMENT FUND
Approved by the Board of Trustees on October 10, 2015
I.	Statement of Responsible Investment Beliefs 
The Investment Committee (IC) believes it has a responsibility to manage the endowment fund’s assets and underlying investments in a manner consistent with the values, culture, and mission of Warren Wilson College.  As such, the Investment Committee feels the need and importance to specifically highlight and illustrate within the endowment fund’s Investment Policy certain guiding principles and investment guidelines reflecting its responsible investing philosophy.
II.	Responsible Investing Philosophy
The Investment Committee intends the integration of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) considerations into investment management strategies, processes and practices in the belief that these factors can benefit the endowment fund’s performance, and provide a qualitative impact consistent with the values, culture and mission of Warren Wilson College.
III.	Guiding Principles
We will incorporate ESG criteria in the endowment fund’s investment analysis and decision-making processes, particularly emphasizing profitable investments with positive social and environmental impacts aligned with the priorities and values of Warren Wilson College.
A.	We will utilize positive screening as a way to proactively benefit the endowment fund’s performance.
B.	We will utilize negative screening to limit the endowment fund’s involvement in those ESG issues which are antithetical to Warren Wilson College’s values, mission, and culture. 
C.	We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the investment managers and funds in which we invest.
D.	We will work to continually enhance our effectiveness in implementing our responsible investment philosophy and practices.
E.	We will report on the endowment fund’s responsible investing activities and progress towards implementing its principles; and provide the necessary disclosures associated with our responsible investing efforts.
F.	Transparency supports adherence to institutional policies and allows for increased stakeholder awareness of endowment fund activities.  When institutional investors consider environmental, social and governance criteria, transparency about these processes increases their effects on social and environmental outcomes.
 
IV.	Responsible Investment Guidelines
A.	The IC’s goals and intentions are to work towards implementing its Responsible Investing Policy across the entire endowment fund and across asset classes over time.  Under the guidance of the endowment fund’s Investment Consultant, a strategic approach will be undertaken selecting investment managers opportunistically in asset classes consistent with the endowment fund’s overall Investment Policy.
B.	The IC's Responsible Investment Guidelines shall apply only to investments in which the endowment fund’s assets are invested in separately managed accounts and which the IC can exercise control of the investment guidelines. 
C.	With commingled funds and limited partnerships, the IC cannot exercise control of the investment guidelines because the investment manager or general partner is required to treat all investors and partners under the same set of investment policies.  However, the Investment Consultant will strive to include managers or partnerships whose commingled funds or partnerships are invested under responsible investment guidelines as similar as possible to, and consistent with, the IC’s Responsible Investment Policy.  Further, the IC and the Investment Consultant will seek to utilize a diverse group of investment managers including minority- and women-owned investment management firms.
D.	Responsible investing risk-factors and investment strategies shall span the following assets classes: 
1.	Fixed income – community development investing, government debt, and certain corporate debt (“green bonds”);
2.	Public Equities – positive or negative screening, ESG integration, and active ownership;
3.	Private Equities – product-focused investments, process-focused investments, economically-targeted investments;
4.	Real Estate – product focused investments, environmental, green and sustainable investments;
Although it reserves subjectivity in its assessment of the endowment fund’s investment managers and underlying investments, the IC and the Investment Consultant expects minimum environmental, social and governance standards, as recognized in the industry by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), will be adhered to by the underlying investment managers the Investment Consultant selects to manage portions of the endowment fund.  The Investment Consultant will advise the Investment Committee of new responsible investing products that investment managers develop, which may be relevant for the endowment fund
 
V.	Responsible Investment Strategies to be Employed
A.	Positive Screens:  Investment managers who are investing in companies involved in the industries and promotion of renewable energy, organic food, local food, sustainable agriculture, community development, diversity, and generally, invest in companies and investments that demonstrate commitment to:
1.	environmental sustainability, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable forestry;
2.	community / economic development and/or investment, particularly in communities with minority or low-income residents;
3.	social diversity in hiring, executives and boards with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation;
4.	transparency and accountability in corporate governance.
B.	Negative Screens:  To the extent possible while protecting the endowment fund from excessive costs and maintaining adequate diversification, investments in companies involved in the production and distribution of oil, gas, and other fossil fuel sources will be avoided.
C.	Monitoring separately managed investments.  The IC and its Investment Consultant will monitor the endowment fund’s investment managers and the underlying investments in the portfolio on an annual basis.
D.	Shareholder advocacy.  In cases in which there are concerns about issues of corporate responsibility, then the IC, acting on its own behalf or in concert with other investors, may engage corporations to change that behavior. An example of such engagement is the sponsoring of shareholder resolutions. The IC may participate with external organizations designed to advocate issues of corporate responsibility.

An ESG advisory committee established by the Investment Committee, and comprising students, faculty, staff and administrators, will assist the Investment Committee on issues relating to the endowment fund’s Responsible Investing Policy.
 
VI.	Reporting
On an annual basis, the IC and its Investment Consultant will provide a report illustrating the Responsible Investment Activities of the endowment fund’s portfolio.  The underlying separate account or all investment managers will be requested to provide information related to ESG characteristics for the underlying investments.  Each investment manager will be asked to communicate openly about its implementation of environmental, social and governance criteria.  The report will be made available to the Warren Wilson College Board of Trustees and the Administration.  At the discretion of the WWC IC, Board of Trustees and Administration the report may be made public under the terms of the aforementioned endowment fund stakeholders.
VII.	Reviewing the Responsible Investment Policy
On an annual basis, the IC will review the Responsible Investment Policy to measure the effectiveness of the endowment fund with the use of selective performance indicators.  Specifically, the assessment will seek to determine:  how well it is working; what progress towards goals have been made; how is the implementation working; what issues are we facing and need to address; what adjustments or revisions, if any, need to be made; has anything changed that requires the IC to make changes to the policy; are there new approaches to responsible investing that could be considered; are the policies consistent with the values, mission and culture of WWC.
