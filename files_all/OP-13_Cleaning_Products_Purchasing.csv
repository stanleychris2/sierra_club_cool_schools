They use the ECOLAB-Hydris system to produce disinfectant solutions. The Hydris system uses an onsite machine to generate weak bleach solutions from salt tablets and water.  According to ECOLAB this reduces the weight of freight by 99% because liquid solutions are not shipped, and it ensures that employees do not use more bleach than necessary.  According to the EPA approval document the Hydris system produces a solution of 0.09% sodium hypochlorite (http://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/001677-00241-20130917.pdf). Three solutions of Hydris are created for different cleaning purposes; 50 ppm, 100 ppm, and 250 ppm.The hazard of a spill of cleaning solutions during shipping is also elminated with this system. Rather than liquids, solid mineral salts are shipped and automatically mixed with water onsite in ECOLABs machine.

Building environments have a significant impact on human and environmental health, learning outcomes, productivity and overall sustainability. Based on extensive industry research focused on building maintenance and operations, technology, and cleaning science, Boston University has identified the best tools, products, and practices for maintaining sustainable buildings that protect human health and the environment. This policy adheres to the LEED v3 2009 for Existing Buildings: Operations & Maintenance standard.
The University began its sustainable cleaning program in the 1990’s to address concerns for personal safety and the desire to increase inefficiencies. A major step was the installation of cleaning command centers to control chemical use, minimize packaging waste, reduce the University’s carbon footprint, and lower the chances of chemical related injuries.  The program has developed over the years by following best business practices to protect the campus community, reduce waste, and meet the cleanliness goals of the University.  Concentrated ongoing efforts have resulted in better means and methods resulting in a more efficient custodial operation. The origins of the sustainable cleaning program at Boston University were based on the collective concerns of Facilities Management & Planning, faculty, staff, and students, combined with information from vendors as technology in the industry changed. 
The campus wide program gained momentum when President Brown launched the University’s sustainability program in September 2008. 
In 2006 the University conducted its first waste audit and determined its recycling rate was 3%. In 2011 the University’s recycling rate increased to 31%, but more importantly its total waste reduced by 10% from its 2006 levels. 
The following sustainable cleaning procedures contributed to this waste reduction:
•	Greater than 60% source reduction from folded to rolled paper
•	Greater than 54% source reduction from small toilet paper rolls to large coreless rolls
•	Greater than 30% source reduction from efforts to right size its waste liners 
•	Preventative maintenance program to extend lifecycle of equipment by over 20%
•	Cradle-to-cradle approach used for cleaning equipment where suppliers take back equipment at the end of its useful life to the University.
•	Greater than 70% chemical and packaging source reduction though concentrated chemical command centers.

Green Mountain College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:55:17,ihrker@greenmtn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,,"Green Clean Policy:

1. Scope
This policy applies to the general cleaning activities at Green Mountain College. 

2. Performance Metrics
Staff training records and equipment maintenance logs must be maintained by the Janitorial vendor. APPA audit and/or customer satisfaction survey results will measure the effectiveness of this program. Purchasing records will serve as documentation for compliance to the chemical and equipment portions of this policy. See section four below for goals and performance measures for each component of the policy.

3. Goals
The goal of this policy is to have a high performance cleaning program in place that reduces the exposure of building occupants and maintenance personnel to potentially hazardous chemical, biological, and particulate contaminants, which adversely affect the air quality, human health, building finishes, building systems, and the environment.

4. Procedures and Strategies
4.1 Sustainable Cleaning Products and Materials
•The use of sustainable cleaning products and materials carries a goal of 100% compliance to sustainable purchasing policy, practices, and spend. This will be measured through a cost analysis and product use verification on a quarterly basis and reviewed regularly for compliance. Ongoing analysis for improvements to products and spend of 3% year over year until the overall goal is met.
•The cleaning products meet one or more of the following standards for the appropriate category:
o Green Seal GS-37, for general purpose, bathroom, glass, and carpet cleaners used for industrial and institutional purposes.
o Environmental Choice CCD-110, for cleaning and degreasing compounds.
o Environmental Choice CCD-146, for hard surface cleaners.
o Environmental Choice CCD-148, for carpet and upholstery care.
•Disinfectants, metal polish, floor finishes, strippers, or other products not addressed by the above standards meet one or more of the following standards for the appropriate category:
o Green Seal GS-40, for industrial and institutional floor care products.
o Environmental Choice CCD-112, for digestive additives for cleaning and odor control.
o Environmental Choice CCD-113, for drain or grease traps additives.
o Environmental Choice CCD-115, for odor control additives.
o Environmental Choice CCD-147, for hard floor care.
o California Code of Regulations maximum allowable VOC levels for the specific product category.
•Disposable janitorial paper products and trash bags meet the minimum requirements of one or more of the following programs for the applicable product category:
o U.S. EPA Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines for Janitorial Paper and Plastic Trash Can Liners.
o Green Seal GS-09, for paper towels and napkins.
o Green Seal GS-01, for tissue paper.
o Environmental Choice CCD-082, for toilet tissue.
o Environmental Choice CCD-086, for hand towels.
o Janitorial paper products derived from rapidly renewable resources made from tree-free fibers.
•Hand soaps meet one or more of the following standards:
o No antimicrobial agents (other than as a preservative) except where required by health codes and other regulations (i.e., food service and health care requirements).
o Green Seal GS-41, for industrial and institutional hand cleaners.
o Environmental Choice CCD-104, for hand cleaners and hand soaps.
4.2 Sustainable Cleaning Equipment – Equipment will be selected based on its ability to protect and enhance: air quality, occupant health, building finishes, and operating systems. Equipment must be maintained and operated in a manner that will reduce exposure of building occupants and cleaning personnel to potentially hazardous conditions, and reduce the disposition of contaminants in the building. The equipment used on site has a goal of 100% to carry the appropriate sustainable seal of green standards. Equipment will be tracked through the equipment inventory list which notes the compliance of green requirements. The measurement will be documented through spend analysis for compliant replacement equipment and ongoing measurements will be repair cost of compliant equipment in relation to non compliant equipment repair costs.
The following standards will apply:
•Vacuum cleaners meet the requirements of the Carpet & Rug Institute “Green Label Program”, and are capable of capturing 96% of particulates 0.3 microns in size and operate with a sound level less than 70dBA
•Hot water extraction equipment for deep cleaning carpets is capable of removing sufficient moisture such that carpets can dry in less than 24 hours, and is certified by the Carpet and Rug Institute Seal of Approval.
•Powered maintenance equipment including floor buffers, burnishers, and automatic scrubbers is equipped with vacuums, guards and/or other devices for capturing fine particulates, and shall operate with a sound level less than 70dBA
•Propane-powered floor equipment has high-efficiency, low-emissions engines with catalytic converters meeting the CARB or EPA standards and operate with a sound level less than 90dBA.
•Automated scrubbing machines are equipped with variable-speed feed pumps and on board chemical metering to optimize the use of cleaning fluids. Alternatively, the scrubbing machines use only tap water with no added cleaning products.
•Battery-powered equipment is equipped with environmentally preferable gel batteries
•Where appropriate, active microfiber technology is used to reduce cleaning chemical consumption and prolong life of disposable scrubbing pads
•Powered equipment is ergonomically designed to minimize vibration, noise, and user fatigue
•Equipment has rollers or rubber bumpers to deduce potential damage to building surfaces
•A log will be kept for all powered housekeeping equipment to document the date of equipment purchase and all repair and maintenance activities, and include vendor cut sheets for each type of equipment in use in the logbook
4.3 Floor Care – The site will establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) that address effective cleaning of hard floor and carpeted surfaces. These SOPs may be part of the Janitorial vendor’s SOPs. Compliance to the SOP is 100% and measured through regular inspection of staff performance.
4.4 Hand Hygiene – The staff will be trained in the importance and methods of hand hygiene. The preferred method of cleaning hands is to lather and scrub your hands using simple soap and warm water for 20 seconds. An alternate method, when soap and warm water are not available, is the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. The use of antibacterial soaps is not recommended because they are no more effective in killing germs than regular soap and may lead to the development of bacteria that are resistant to the products' antimicrobial agents, making it even harder to kill these germs in the future. As a component of training and vital to the health and safety of the employee and the building occupants a 100% compliance goal is required. Those not compliant will be retrained on the proper procedures and training time documented.
4.5 Chemical Handling & Storage (& spill response) – Bulk storage of cleaning chemicals should be in a centralized secure area with containment that will protect against an inadvertent release to the environment (i.e. no floor drains in the vicinity). Cleaning chemicals shall be stored neatly using a shelving system that will allow for safe handling of the material. If necessary, appropriately designed step-stools or step-ladders shall be provided to access the upper shelves. Point-of-use storage, such as in janitorial closets, shall maintain the minimum quantity of chemicals as practical. Where appropriate, cleaning chemical dispensing systems shall be used to minimize the handling exposure to the employees and to measure the proper amount of cleaning solution for dilution. Proper Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE) shall be provided to employees handling the cleaning chemicals. All personnel that use the cleaning chemicals shall be properly trained in their handling, use, and spill cleanup. Hazardous spills or mishandling incidents shall be managed to minimize personnel exposure, damage to the environment, and damage to the building. All spills shall be reported immediately to building management and emergency response in accordance with the appropriate emergency response procedure. Critical to the health and safety of the employee and the building occupants a 100% compliance goal is required. Monthly inspections by the onsite Safety Manager will be conducted and documented. Those not compliant will be retrained on the proper procedures and training time documented.
4.6 Training – The building’s janitorial staff shall be trained in elements of the Green Clean Policy and in the associated Green Clean SOPs. This training will ensure that the staff is fully educated on the products, equipment, and procedures, as well as the goals and priorities that are critical to the success of the green cleaning program. All Manulife buildings will follow the established Green Clean Programs 100% of the time. Additional trainings will be provided for safety, skills training, and any other requirements or needs as identified on the site. All training will be documented and tracked for each employee by training type documenting the hours monthly, and reported to the Property Manager.
4.7 Continuous Improvement – The effectiveness of the Green Cleaning Program shall be evaluated periodically through either customer satisfaction surveys to the tenants or through an APPA (Association of Physical Plant Administrators) audit that determines the appearance level of the facility, or both. A quarterly goal of four (4) improvements is required. These improvements are evaluated, vetted, and approved by the client prior to implementation. The improvements are then tracked by the appropriate metric to determine if the delivery matches the expected return.
4.8 Customer Feedback is encouraged throughout the building tenants. The building occupants can comment on service through multiple tools: 1) enter a complaint work order through the CMMS, 2) an on-line survey request is sent to the service requester upon completion of a work order, and 3) a “man on the street” survey is conducted throughout each month. With this, the Facilities Manager will stop people in the hall and ask them a series of questions regarding their satisfaction with the work environment. This is rated on a scale of 1-5 and data compiled and reported on monthly to the Property Director.

5. Responsible Party
The site Property Director is responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy.

6. Time Period
This policy is effective immediately upon issue.

Policy Approved April 1, 2010

ISU Purchasing’s role is to support campus wide sustainability through the communications of guidelines, information, and by providing resources that will minimize any negative impact on society and the environment to the greatest extent possible.
ISU Purchasing is developing and maintaining information on our web site about environmentally and socially preferable products and services and will communicate, to the various departments, University policy in regards to sustainability.
We will promote the three R’s: reduce, reuse, and recycle.  Purchasing & Central Receiving manages all surplus items at the University.  From inception we have relocated reusable items back out on campus, as items have become available. For at least the last fifteen years we have hosted auctions where we sell items no-longer of use to the University.  The result has been to reduce the disposal costs and landfill volume and the auctions extend the useful life of items through their reuse.  Additionally, we recycle items that might have little appeal in the auction.
Purchasing encourages the use of durable and reusable products, giving some weight to the best long-term value when selecting products.  
Purchasing will be looking at the various vendors’ abilities to receive their products back for recycling at the end of their useful life.  Examples being: carpeting, asphalt, oil, batteries, electronics, and toner cartridges.
Procurement in bulk or concentrated form will be encouraged in an effort to minimize our impact on transportation resources.
ISU Purchasing has begun to encourage the broader long term view in the procurement of items such as printers, copiers, and fax machines that have the capability of duplex printing and the ability to cut paper consumption in half.
ISU Purchasing encourages the sending and storing of documents electronically, again saving on paper usage.

Mount Holyoke College is committed to providing a safe, clean environment to the entire College community. We are also committed to implementing practices that are environmentally friendly and promote sustainability. This green cleaning policy is part of that commitment.   

Benefits of Green Cleaning

Green Cleaning is a term that means cleaning in a manner that protects health without harming the environment. Green cleaning has many potential benefits, including reducing exposure to toxic and highly irritating chemicals, reducing exposure to carcinogens and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), reducing dust and chemical allergens, and reducing the number of chemicals needed to maintain facilities. Other goals of green cleaning include reducing use of energy and water, promoting safety and training. These factors contribute to efficiency and financial savings.  

Certifications

EcoLogo is North America’s largest, most respected environmental standard and certification mark. EcoLogo offers third party certification of environmentally preferable products and provides customers, public, corporate and consumer, with assurance that the products and services bearing the logo meet stringent standards of environmental leadership.

Green Seal is a non-profit organization that develops life cycle-based sustainability standards for products, services and companies and offers third-party certification for those that meet the criteria in the standard. Green Seal has been actively identifying and promoting sustainability in the marketplace, and helping organizations be greener in a real and effective way since 1989.

Purchasing

In accordance with the College’s commitment to sustainability, safety and the environment will be considered in making all purchases. The College preference is that all cleaning chemicals purchased will be Green Seal or EcoLogo-certified. When it is not feasible to use a Green Seal or EcoLogo-certified chemical, the least hazardous product possible will be selected. 

Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed when new products are considered or if new cleaning procedures are implemented. The review will be conducted by the Manager of Cleaning Services to ensure that we are using the best possible practices, our cleaning program is having as little impact as possible and that we are providing the safest environment for all members of the College community.","MHC has been using environmentally friendly “green” cleaning chemicals since 2002 in all of our buildings.

-Zone Managers will send all new chemical and equipment requests to their respective Deputy Assistant Directors, who will in turn present the information to the Director of Housekeeping
- Deputy Assistant Directors will then send these requests for purchase to the appropriate committees for consideration and review to ensure that the items meet Green Seal/CRI standards where applicable and required.
- Committees assigned to review the items will either be the Equipment Committee or the Chemical Committee. The Green Committee will be made aware of any decisions made as to their implementation and thereby include this in their quarterly meeting and inclusion on the Sustainability website for general University knowledge
- Once the item under consideration has been approved by the respective committee, then the suggestion to move forward with the use and purchase of item is presented to the Zone Managers at one of the bi-weekly meetings of the Zone Managers
- Zone Managers are then given a time period of 30 days to test the product in their zones and to provide feedback as to the effectiveness of the item in the cleaning process.
-During this testing process, the vendor supplying the item will provide initial training to the Zone Managers on usage of item
- Zone Managers will then designate 1-2 employees to use the product and then provide training to them via the vendor or Zone Manager
- At the next bi-weekly Zone Manager meeting the team will vote on the use of the new product, providing the necessary feedback. If the item is approved by the majority, then it will be considered as an item for use in the Housekeeping Department.
- Training will then be coordinated with the appropriate vendor to make sure every employee is properly trained on safety, usage, storage and preventative maintenance (if equipment) of the selected product.
- Subsequent training of new employees will be handled in each zone by the Zone Manager or General Utility Worker (G.U.W.)
- Refresher courses will be implemented into the OJT module as needed and deemed by the Unit Training Coordinator for new and existing employees

The procedures for checking and safe operation of the equipment that is introduced into the Green Program are as follows:
- All new equipment is reviewed, researched and approved by the Equipment Committee and Zone Managers to meet the standards required by the USGBC or CRI Institute
- Once approved, the procedure for using each piece of equipment will vary, depending on the type of equipment, but all use will follow these general guidelines
- Maintenance Mechanics must check each new piece of equipment for electrical safety and operation prior to its use by the unit to ensure that it is functioning within established parameters
- Operator of the equipment must wear all Personal Protective Equipment as outlined by the manufacturer of the equipment
- Prior to each use, the operator must inspect the cord (if applicable) to make sure that the ground plug is intact and that there are not any cuts or tears in the cord insulation that might result in the unsafe operation of the equipment.
- If defects are found, the equipment must immediately be removed from service and sent to the Maintenance Mechanics for servicing. This is accomplished by submitting a work order.
- Once the equipment has been inspected for safety prior to operation, then user will operate following the instructions given by the manufacturer, including training received from the vendor providing the equipment and from the Zone Manager in each zone throughout the unit
- Upon completion of the task, the operator will clean and store the equipment in the designated area, inspecting the cord (if applicable) for any damage.

Supplies/Materials and Soil Reduction items that are new will follow the process outlined below:
- Deputy Assistant Directors and the Director of Housekeeping will propose new paper products and soil reduction items (entrance mats) that meet the criteria for Green Seal/Recyclable materials as set forth by the USGBC.

There are a variety of certifications and principles that apply to cleaning products, equipment, and procedures. After researching various certifications and labels, the College has determined that Green Seal-certified and EcoLogo-certified products are in general the preferred options, with exceptions made on a case-by-case basis. 

>> Cleaning Products Cleaning products have one of the following certifications:
- General-purpose, bathroom, glass, and carpet cleaners: Green Seal GS-37
- Cleaning and degreasing compounds: EcoLogo CCD-110 
- Hard surface cleaners: EcoLogo CCD-146
- Carpet and upholstery care: EcoLogo CCD-148
- Floor care: Green Seal GS-40
- Digestion additives: EcoLogo CCD-112
- Drain or grease trap additives: EcoLogo CCD-113
- Odor control additives: EcoLogo CCD-115
- Hard ﬂ oor care: EcoLogo CCD-147
- Hand soap: Green Seal GS-41; EcoLogo CCD-104; foaming or other high-efficiency soaps 
where possible; no antimicrobial agents except where required.

Cleaning systems utilizing ionized or electrolyzed water as a sanitizer and general cleaner will be phased in as feasible as a means of reducing chemical use. 
The use of harsh disinfectants will be minimized and used only as needed at primary contact points, including bathroom sinks and toilets. Bleach and phenolic disinfectants will be used only when necessary. Disinfectants used will be H2O2-based and EPA-registered.

>> Floor Care Systems 
 - Floor sealers, finishes, strippers, and maintainers should be used on an as-needed basis rather 
than a frequency schedule in order to minimize their use. Green Seal-certified products (GS-40) will be preferred, though used only when effective and their use should be phased in. Housekeeping and the Sustainability Integration Office will continue to evaluate new Green Seal-certified floor care systems as they become available. 
- When possible, floors will not be sealed or finished in order to reduce the need for maintenance products and procedures. 
- To further reduce the impact of floor maintenance, the College utilizes the following 
procedures:
 - The use of dust collection mechanisms for burnishers
 - Autoscrubber or mop-on products in lieu of spray products.
- Low-water autoscrubbers equipped with chemical control systems and with a noise level of less than 70dBA.
- Orbital scrubbing/stripping machines that minimize water use and that do not require 
chemical stripper.
- Scrubbing and burnishing pads with recycled content.
- Equipment chosen to minimize water use. 
- Staff trained in minimizing water use in floor procedures.
- Gel and other less environmentally-hazardous equipment batteries.

>> Cleaning Equipment Cleaning equipment should be high-efficiency, low-noise, and low-impact. 
Specific requirements are as follows:
- Vacuum cleaners are certified by Carpet and Rug Institute Green Label Testing Program and operated with sound level of less than 70dBA
- Carpet extraction equipment used for restorative deep cleaning is certified by Carpet and Rug Institute’s Seal of Approval Testing Program
- Powered floor maintenance equipment is equipped with vacuums, guards, and/or other devices for capturing fine particulates and operates with sound level of less than 70dBA
- Propane-powered floor equipment has high-efficiency, low-emissions engines that meet CARB or EPA standards, and operates with a sound level of less than 90dBA
- Battery-powered equipment is equipped with environmentally preferable gel batteries
- Powered equipment is ergonomically designed to minimize vibration, noise and user fatigue
- Equipment is designed with safeguards, such as rollers or rubber bumpers, to reduce damage to surfaces

>> Dilution Systems and Packaging All cleaning products will be administered with an adequate dilution control system. Products with reduced packaging, recyclable packaging, and packaging with recycled content are preferred. 

>> Dusters, Mops, and Cleaning Tools The College uses only re-usable, launderable, microfiber cloths and mops as cleaning tools, in lieu of paper. These cloths and mops will replace all disposable cleaning tools as feasible, and should be washed in water- and energy-efficient, EnergyStar label washing machines and dryers. Additional preferred tools include recycled content PET plastic wet mops (100% post-consumer waste PET), bamboo mop handles, and other products with recycled content and/or rapidly renewable materials. 

>> Entrance Matting Permanent entry systems (including grills, grates, and mats) will be utilized in College facilities to reduce dirt and particulates entering facilities, which improves indoor air quality and reduces maintenance and cleaning needs. Entrance areas are vacuumed, swept, mopped, and/or dusted frequently. Entry systems should be made from environmentally preferable materials (such as rubber) and/or with recycled content where available, and should be recyclable. 

>> Deodorizers Automatic Aerosol Deodorizers are not a part of the College’s preferred Green Cleaning Program, because they contain high levels of Volatile Organic Compounds. Air freshening systems should be non-aerosol, including products that operate with a wick system or that otherwise have no aerosol propellants. 

>> Urinal Blocks Urinal blocks should not be used because they contain hazardous materials. 

>> Paper Products 
- Cleaning-related paper products should hold at least one certification as follows:
 - Paper towels and napkins: Green Seal GS-09; EcoLogo CCD-086
 - Tissue paper: Green Seal GS-01; EcoLogo CCD-082
- Products should also be Processed Chlorine Free (PCF)
- Additional considerations for paper products include:
 - The use of rapidly renewable materials or tree-free fibers
 - Waste-reducing design, including coreless rolls and regulated towel dispensers
 - Post-consumer recycled content
 - The impacts of whitening and/or bleaching processes
 - Forestry practices and related certifications (e.g. Forest Stewardship Council-certified)
- The installation of high-efficiency hand dryers are recommended, as long as they can be installed without companion hand towel dispensers. 
- Partial rolls of toilet paper and other paper products should not be discarded when replaced. 

>>  Plastic bags used in cleaning operations, including trash and recycling bags, should have the highest possible level of recycled content. Clean or unused bags that need to be discarded should be recycled. 

Additional Procedures:
Staff members cleaning a facility should make certain to turn off all lights and other powered equipment (as directed) when leaving work areas, and only turn on lights and equipment as necessary to complete assignments.","If products, procedures, or equipment must be used that do not meet the standards, they should be used for an isolated issue that can only be mitigated by using that item or action. Occasional deviation from the program is acceptable on a case-by-case basis as determined by Facilities and Campus Services and the Sustainability Integration Office.  Facilities and Campus Services will continually test environmentally-preferred products from a variety of manufacturers in order to best understand what will be effective for the College.  The Sustainability Integration Office reviews annual purchasing of green cleaning products and ensures compliance and provides assistance in researching and recommending alternative sustainable products when issues arise. Staff using these procedures will be trained on an annual basis to reiterate the purpose, goals, and details of the Green Cleaning Program.

promotes sustainability. Designing and implementing a welcoming, safe, supportive and
sustainable campus and its infrastructure are foundational to Spelman’s ability to deliver
signature experiences for the Atlanta University Center.
Spelman’s cleaning operations and the products used on a daily basis ensure that it
provides socially responsible services and an economic impact to the Spelman family. It is committed to purchasing resources responsibly and efficiently by weaving daily green
cleaning into our daily operations. Providing daily green cleaning products helps ensure human health and provides a cleaning service that minimizes its environmental footprint. The Spelman green cleaning program provides a more healthful indoor environment for educators, workers, students and staff. The green cleaning program also reinforces mindsets and habits that lead to more responsible personal habits. The environmental commitment uses safer chemicals to protect users while minimizing environmental damage, reduces packaging and transportation impact through the use of concentrated products. The green cleaning program reduces water use and pollution potential and aligns with LEED certification criteria. The economic picture reduces the quantity of cleaning products necessary for daily cleaning; transitioning from ready-to-use (RTU) to concentrate products saves money and reduces turnover rate through demonstration of worker safety priority.

The Office of General Services of the State of New York considers the continuation and enhancement of agency green cleaning programs to be part and parcel of compliance with EO 4, and that state agencies, including SUNY New Paltz, must utilize green cleaning practices to comply with EO 4.

The Office of General Services of New York State has developed a list of selected cleaning and maintenance products for schools and state agencies/public authorities to purchase and use. The OGS Approved Green Cleaning Products List organizes products in the following six categories: general purpose cleaners; glass cleaners; bathroom cleaners; toilet bowl cleaners; carpet cleaners; and carpet spot removers. The revised guidelines require that each product meet one of three criteria: 
1) Green Seal, Inc. certification under revised GS-37; 
2) EcoLogo certification; or 
3) Self-Attestation (see Section V. B. for details). 

Additionally, the Guidelines continue to include cleaning products that were not impacted by the revised GS-37 standard, such as floor finishes, floor finish strippers, hand cleaners/hand soaps and vacuum cleaners.

Additionally, it is intended to reduce the risk of both occupants and cleaning personnel from injury and/or health problems.

Cleaning methods set forth in this plan emphasize the removal of indoor pollutants and maintaining a safe and healthy environment while minimizing the amount of product used and the amount of waste that is created. Products include general purpose cleaners, bathroom cleaners, glass cleaners, carpet cleaners, disinfectants, floor care products, hand soaps, paper supplies for cleaning, paper supplies for bathrooms, and plastic trash bags. The product recommendations included in this plan are meant to meet or exceed LEED EBOM EQ Prerequisite 3 of acceptable cleaning products; however, substitute products may be used, provided they meet similar criteria. Products that do not contain environmental contaminants help reduce the ecological impact of cleaning products that are flushed into the water supply/filtration system. Green cleaning is one aspect in building maintenance that can reduce VOC as well as bacteria and fungi.

The Sustainable Practices Policy (“Policy”) establishes goals in nine areas of 
sustainable practices: green building, clean energy, transportation, climate protection, 
sustainable operations, waste reduction and recycling, environmentally preferable 
purchasing, sustainable foodservice, sustainable water systems.

Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP)
Sustainable Economy
1. The University seeks to compare the total cost of ownership when evaluating 
the cost of goods and services for the selection of suppliers. The total cost of ownership includes the initial purchase price and all other initial costs, including installation, freight, taxes and fees where applicable, operating cost, maintenance cost, warranty cost, collection, and end-of-life disposal or recycling costs. 
2.“Cradle to cradle” is the University’s preferred purchasing standard. It is defined 
as accountable, responsible, and environmentally preferable supply chain 
management from material extraction, production, marketing, sale, use, disposal, collection, re-use and the web of closed loop cycles and processes.
3.The University will complete the transition of all locations toward electronic and 
paperless e-procurement systems, and will use web-based catalogs, punch-out, and other electronic programs.
4.The University will incorporate the credit requirements set forth by LEED-NC, LEED-CI, and LEED-EBOM into product and service sourcing and procurement when applicable.
5.The University will use its purchasing power and prominence to advance the development of sustainable technologies and products by pressing markets to continually lower resource use in the manufacturing and distribution processes and increase productivity of their plants, warehouses, and distribution methods.
6. Each Commodity Team working on a specific RFI, RFQ, or RFP for products will 
determine the appropriate sustainability requirements to be included in these 
documents.  Additionally, the Commodity Team will decide if and how many 
Quality Points utilized in the Total Cost per Quality Point bid evaluation methodology will be allocated to sustainability requirements.
Sustainability and the Supply Chain
7.
The University will require all strategically sourced suppliers to present their 
organization’s continuous
improvement with the development of sustainable 
products and operational practices in the Procurement Services/Strategic 
Sourcing Quarterly Business Reviews.
8.
The University will require all strategically sourced suppliers, and eventually all 
suppliers, t
o report annually on the qualitative aspects of their business 
operations and to report quarterly on the sales of products, which will result in

In compliance with the Governor’s Executive Order No. 14 and Connecticut Public Act No. 07-100, on October 1, 2007, UConn was mandated to switch to Green Seal certified cleaning products whenever available through vendors. We encourage offices to comply with these laws when buying small items like desktop cleaners. Central Stores stocks green cleaning products and if you are going to purchase items outside the UConn system, look for products that are Green Seal Certified. It used to be that these cleaners were more expensive than conventional cleaners, but this does not hold true anymore.

• Purpose
• Responsibilities of Departments
• The purpose of this policy is to support campus sustainability at the University of Florida and to provide guidelines, information, and resources in procuring products that will minimize negative impacts on society and the environment to the greatest extent practicable.
• Develop and maintain information about environmentally and socially preferable products. Departments should use the list composed in this document as a guideline and may add or modify the list as needed.
• Inform employees of their responsibilities under this policy; provide them with information about sustainable procurement opportunities. Check the Purchasing web page for frequent updates on vendor commitments to sustainability, including new annual contracts and participation in vendor shows.
• Submit new ideas, problems or concerns to Purchasing (352) 392-1331 or e-mail purchasing@ufl.edu.
• Best Practices and Procurement Strategies
• Reduce waste at the point of purchase.
Faculty, staff and students can help achieve the university's waste reduction goals by practicing the three R's: reducing, reusing, and recycling. Priority should be given to reducing waste upstream by purchasing products made from recycled material that can be reused or recycled.
￼• Office paper, letterhead stationery, envelopes, and business cards made from recycled paper
• Office supplies
• Recycled, remanufactured, or re-filled toner cartridges
• Furniture made with a percentage of postconsumer or postindustrial
material and/or FSC 50% certified wood
To reduce disposal costs and waste, choose items that can be remanufactured, recycled, or composted. Many products made from recycled materials are available and are being included in the University of Florida contracts.
Contract information is available from the Purchasing website under contracts and UF Pricing.
• Purchase durable and reusable goods.
Using life-cycle cost analysis, rather than automatically choosing goods with the lowest purchase price, can help departments identify the best long-term value. Factor in a product's estimated life span as well as its energy, maintenance, consumable supplies and disposal costs.
• Consider durability and reparability of products prior to purchase.
• Invest in goods with extended warranties. Conduct routine maintenance on products/equipment.
• Save money and minimize waste by eliminating single-use items, such as non rechargeable batteries, in favor of rechargeable batteries. Use rechargeable cartridges.
• Lease and rent when appropriate.
Consider an operating lease or rental rather than a purchase or capital lease. Lease and rental contracts give vendors the responsibility for the upkeep of goods such as computers and copiers, and for managing them at the end of their useful life. Businesses that lease equipment tend to manufacture more durable items, salvage reusable parts, refurbish, recycle, or donate used equipment that can no longer be leased. Renting is a cost-effective option for short-term equipment needs.
• Specify product and packaging take-back.
• Increasingly, product vendors are offering to take back the products
they sell when they become obsolete. By utilizing vendors who offer an Extended Product Responsibility (EPR) program, especially take-back, recycle, and disposal programs, departments are ensured equipment and products are disposed of properly whether recycled, donated, refurbished or disposed of without the added cost.
• Other vendors will take back used items, such as carpeting and toner cartridges, when purchasers buy new products. For example,
￼several carpet manufacturers have invested in sophisticated recycling facilities that turn old carpet into new carpet or other goods and toner cartridges are disposed of properly or sent to be recharged and sold at a lower cost.
• Departments should require vendors to assume responsibility for some of their shipping materials, such as wooden pallets and excess packaging materials. When ordering large furniture or computer shipments request products ship blanket-wrapped or using reduced packing material.
• Buy goods in bulk or concentrated form.
This practice can significantly reduce the packaging associated with lower product quantities and save costs. Carefully estimate demand when purchasing in bulk; purchasing more than is needed can create excess that becomes waste.
• Manage surplus effectively.
The University of Florida can reduce waste by eliminating excess purchases. Reviewing past needs can minimize the procurement of unneeded items. Clean out your office supply cabinet and post re- usable items for UF Departments on GatorList.net or donate to local non-profit organizations such as Alachua County's Tools for Schools. Departments should utilize Asset Management Services for disposing of unwanted, out-dated property. Asset Management will effectively redistribute, recycle, or dispose of surplus property by bidding it out over the Internet through surplus on-line bids, police auctions, property warehouse, or federal warehouse. For more information see Asset Management Services Web Site: http://fa.ufl.edu/am/surplus/.
• Procure commodities that are certified to meet sustainability standards.
Paper and Forest Products:
• Forest Stewardship Council - www.fsc.org
• Chlorine Free Products Association - www.chlorinefreeproducts.org
Electronics and Appliances:
• Energy Star - www.energystar.gov/purchasing
• Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) -
www.epeat.net
EPEAT has tiers of environmental performance. UF's bundled computers will meet at least the EPEAT silver standard. UF's preference is that when the certification is available on the products being purchased, all purchases of computers and monitors meet or exceed the silver EPEAT certification.

Food:
• USDA Organic, Food Alliance Certified, Ranforest Alliance Certified,
Protected Harvest Certified, Fair TrADE OR Marine Stewardship Council's Blue Eco-Label
• Procure remanufactured goods and use refurbishing services.
It is generally much less expensive to buy remanufactured goods such as remanufactured toner cartridges, or to use refurbishing services for computer upgrades, carpet repair, and furniture reupholster, than to buy new items. ""Recharged"" toner cartridges typically save departments 30 to 50 percent per sheet of paper. Remanufactured items should require no sacrifice in performance. Check with Purchasing for current contracts in place for remanufactured products.
• Purchase goods containing fewer toxic constituents.
By procuring goods with fewer or no toxic chemicals, departments can reduce their hazardous waste disposal, future liability concerns, and the risk of occupational exposure and spills. Low-toxicity products such as mercury-free medical supplies, low mercury light bulbs/lamps with a content of 90 picograms per lumen-hour or less, printing ink low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and chrome and chlorine free cleaning supplies are increasingly available and cost-competitive. See the Cross-sector certifications to help selecting products. The University prefers all cleaning products purchased are either Green Seal or EcoLogo certified.
• Reduce paper use.
• Set all printers, copiers, and fax machines to the default duplex
mode if the function is available.
• Purchase office equipment that has duplex capability.
￼• Purchase paper with recycled content
• Utilize technology to send and store information electronically.
• Utilize internet fax when available.
• E-mail document files instead of faxing hardcopies.
• Instead of having forms preprinted and stored, fill out forms online
and print as needed when available and feasible.
• Store documents electronically instead of storing hard copies.
￼• Current Guidelines in Place
￼• All University of Florida personnel will purchase recycled and environmentally preferable products whenever practicable.
• University of Florida Departments will purchase hybrid or alternative fuel vehicles.
• The University of Florida will have a recycle container available within a reasonable distance of soda machines and in all dining establishments where canned or bottled drinks are served: http://www.ppd.ufl.edu/grndrr.htm. Contact Physical Plant's Solid Waste Coordinator at 392-7396 or 392-1148 x 301.
• University of Florida should promote the use of recycled and other environmentally preferable products by publicizing its sustainable procurement program. Materials produced for advertising, conferences, trade fairs, press releases, and other communications with clients and citizens can make reference to the University of Florida's commitment and leadership in the use of recycled and environmentally/socially preferable products.
• The University Purchasing and Disbursements Department will make every effort to secure contracts with vendors that are socially and environmentally conscientious, and certified green whenever practicable.
￼• Purchasing and UF's Zero Waste by 2015 Goal
• Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) Resources

GREEN-SUSTAINABILITY PURCHASING POLICY 
PURPOSE 
Responding to the growing need for environmental stewardship and the University’s commitment for the implementation of sustainable practices, Mount Union has adopted this Green-Sustainability Purchasing Policy. Green-Sustainability Purchasing is defined as taking into consideration the impact of products on the environment and human health when making purchasing decisions, giving preference to more environmentally friendly and energy efficient products when quality and cost are equal or superior. Green purchasing guidelines are a formal set of goals that direct the University’s implementation of green-sustainability purchasing. 
PURCHASING GUIDELINES 
Product specifications and requisitions for products must conform to the following guidelines: 
1) To the extent such information is known, requisition originators shall identify in the purchase requisition products available with recycled content or qualified ENERGY STAR products and vendors from whom such products are available. 
2) The Purchasing Department and/or Delegate has the authority to specify a minimum recycled content or approved ENERGY STAR qualified product in bid specifications. 
3) Specifications and requisitions shall not require the exclusive use of products made from virgin materials, nor specifically exclude the use of recycled-content or ENERGY STAR qualified products. 
4) Performance standards must be reasonable and related to function and purpose, and shall not be designed to exclude the purchase of recycle-content products or products that are ENERGY STAR qualified. 
The current list of ENERGY STAR qualified products is available on-line at www.energystar.gov. 
In addition, other considerations involved in requisition specifications include the ability 
of a product and it’s packaging to be reused, reconditioned or recycled through the University’s existing recycling collection program. 
PURCHASING POLICIES AND GOALS 
• To maintain a consistent “cradle to grave” supply chain and purchasing process which considers economic, ethical, social and environmental impacts for all contracts and purchases. 
• To integrate green-sustainability purchasing concepts and products into architectural designs, final construction documents and into the final construction or renovation of Mount Union buildings. 
• To utilize environmentally responsible biodegradable solvents and cleaning supplies whenever practicable as long as quality and performance is not compromised. Products shall be “Green Seal” certified or “Ecologo” labeled. 
• To purchase computers (desktop and laptop) that are Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) rated silver or gold when possible. 
• To conduct research and procure alternative energy when practicable, from certified alternative energy suppliers. 
• To evaluate the purchase of fleet vehicles that utilize alternative fuel and/or increase the average fuel efficiency of the overall fleet. 
• To ensure that proper MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) are identified in all purchasing specifications and kept on record as required by OSHA. 
• To work with suppliers in the area in the areas of reduction and reuse of packaging materials. 
• To make suppliers aware of Mount Union’s Green Purchasing Policy sending a clear message that Mount Union will favor those suppliers whose products meet the environmental objectives of the University. 
• More specifically, Mount Union will consider utilizing to the fullest extent possible, environmentally friendly or green products that have the following attributes or qualities: 
o Durable as opposed to single use or disposable items. 
o Made of recycled materials, maximizing post-consumer content. 
o Non-toxic or minimally toxic, preferably biodegradable. 
o Highly energy efficient in production and use. 
o Recyclable, but if not, may be disposed of safely. 
o Made from raw materials obtained in an environmentally sound, sustainable manner. 
o Manufactured in an environmentally sound, sustainable manner by companies with good environmental track records. 
o Cause minimal or no environmental damage during normal use or maintenance. 
o Shipped with minimal packaging (consistent with care of product). 


o Produced locally or regionally to minimize the environmental cost of shipping and the reduction of emissions during transportation. 

Hence forth, Mount Union will give preference to environmentally superior products, where quality, function and cost are equal or superior. Whenever practicable and possible, products and packaging materials will contain a prescribed minimum post-consumer recycled content and will be minimized and/or substituted with more environmentally appropriate alternatives. All products will be chosen based on efficient use of energy, natural resources and potential for safe, non-hazardous disposal. 
Whenever practicable means that the recycle products can perform the function intended at least as well as products from only virgin material, and the cost of the recycle product reasonably approximates the cost of the product produced only from virgin materials. 
Mount Union will work with give special preference to vendors who are socially and environmentally responsible in adhering to the above principals and guidelines. 
END.
","* A brief description of steps the institution has taken to ensure that the purchasing policy, directives, or guidelines are followed 
We operate on such a decentralized purchasing structure, so it is difficult to make sure we are following the Green Purchasing guidelines for most orders. For the everyday purchases, we trust that a manager, would try their best to shop green while keeping other factors like cost in mind.
If we do a large request for a quote through multiple vendors, UMU’s Purchasing Agent has more control of keeping the green purchasing policy in mind. In these instances, if it is applicable, UMU’s Purchasing Agent will include contract requirements related to the Green Purchasing Policy. For example, when we shopped for new copiers, we took into account electrical usage and how the vendor would recycle and dispose of our old copiers. Also, many of our vendor contracts are shopped through group purchasing organizations, and these will oftentimes include language that helps meet our Green Purchasing Policy. For individual users, UMU’s Purchasing Agent tries to remind them to review all policies and procedures out on the portal and to make sure they are aware they are out there.

Our mission is to provide an environment for learning and discovery at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. We will fulfill our mission while using environmentally responsible cleaning products, equipment, and sustainable processes.

Purpose

This Sustainability Initiative affirms our commitment to be a responsible member of the university community, communicates our dedication to provide a safe and healthful environment, and expresses our vision for the future.

Our goals

Use Environmentally Preferred Products. It is our responsibility to safeguard the environment and public health.

Practice Conservation. We will conserve energy, water, and other resources while providing high quality service.

Support Sustainability. We will use products and procedures which allow for the systematic reuse of materials and reduction of waste.

Environmental safeguards and strategies employed to meet our goals.

1.Aerosols, abrasive powder, and flammable products have been removed from the workplace.


2.The cleaning product line has been minimized. We use either Green Seal GS-37 approved products or products with low-volatile organic compounds (VOC). A tracking system is established to monitor chemical use.


3.Hand soaps do not contain antimicrobial agents. (triclosan and triclocarban)


4.All products used by Custodial Services are packaged in cardboard and plastic containers that are recycled after use.


5.Disinfectants are used only minimally on skin-contact areas in restrooms and for cleaning blood and body spills.


6.Cleaning frequencies and work schedules have been optimized for areas of greatest use.


7.Daily floor care maintenance is performed on a set schedule to prolong floor finish life. Periodic floor stripping and refinishing projects are performed as needed rather than on a set schedule to conserve resources and minimize the use of chemicals.







8.The broad use of new-technology reusable microfiber cleaning cloths, wet mops and dust mops minimizes waste, reduces the use of chemicals, and increases the effectiveness of the cleaning procedures.


9.Color-coded tools are used to prevent any cross-contamination from restrooms and enable correct use by employees who have English as a second language. Color-coded tools include:

◦Microfiber cloths which are color-coded for specific uses.
 Yellow cloths are used in restrooms on toilets and urinals.
Red cloths are used for general cleaning in restrooms.
Green cloths are used for general cleaning outside of restrooms.


◦Labeled, color-coded containers, which correspond to the microfiber color code, are used to organize cleaning tools on custodial carts and identify where the tools are to be used.


◦Cleaning chemicals on custodial carts are dispensed from color-coded containers and bottles with manufacturer’s silk-screen labels and directions.


◦A separate, color-coded microfiber wet mop is used in restrooms only.


◦Different colors of protective gloves are used with one specific color for use in

restrooms and a different color for other use.



10.Personal Protective Equipment including protective gloves, safety goggles or eyewear, dust masks, and nonslip footwear is provided to all custodians and required when cleaning restrooms, mixing chemicals, when working overhead, or when stripping floors.


11.Flip-top applicators, foam applicators, and coarse-spray only from trigger sprayers are required when applying chemicals to avoid the inhalation of fine particulates and the overuse and waste of cleaning products.


12.Safeguards and sustainable strategies are emphasized in all custodial training as all employees are encouraged and supported to work in an environmentally responsible manner. Employees are directly involved in the testing of new products and equipment.


13.Chemical management systems are employed wherever possible to facilitate the proper dilution of chemical products and limit employee exposure to chemical concentrates.

◦Chemical dilution systems are mounted in custodial rooms.


◦Portable dilution devices are available for remote work sites.


◦Ready-to-use products are used where appropriate for safety and efficiency.



14.Building entryways receive priority cleaning. High-performance entrance mat systems are installed to trap dirt, moisture, and pollutants before they can migrate into the buildings. The mat systems are cleaned regularly to retain their effectiveness.







15.Dual, large-roll paper towel and toilet tissue dispensers are used to minimize packaging and waste. Paper products must meet the EPA standards for post-consumer recycled content:

◦Paper Towels – 40% post-consumer recycled content.


◦Toilet Tissue – 20% post-consumer recycled content.



16.High density trash liners are used and only on a minimal basis in vending areas.


17.High filtration vacuum cleaners are used and carry the Carpet and Rug Institute’s Seal of Approval for vacuums. These vacuum cleaners employ HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, sealed casings and hose connections, disposable paper collection bags, are ergonomically designed and operate at a sound level of less than 70dbA.


18.Low-moisture carpet extractors with high pressure and high vacuum are used to decrease drying time, extend the life of the carpet, and protect against mold and mildew. Air movers are used to facilitate faster drying times.


19.Powered floor scrubbing machines are equipped with variable-speed feed pumps, on- board chemical metering, F.A.S.T. (Foam-Activated Scrubbing Technology) and other low-moisture and metered-solution systems to optimize the use of water and cleaning chemical.


20.Electrical-powered cleaning equipment is preventively-maintained on a set schedule. Properly maintained equipment is safe and efficient to operate and has a prolonged working life.


Our Vision

Custodial Services will advance our goals by emphasizing environmentally safe and effective practices and use of products. We will test the application of new advances in the industry and will adopt and implement concepts that lead to greater sustainability and the conservation of our resources.

* Discretionary use of disinfectants (considered toxic) are used only where necessary. Stripping of floors is only done on an “as needed” basis. We have purchased a floor stripping machine that strips large areas with only plain water or a very small amount of neutral cleaner added to the water.
* Marmoleum® flooring which does not require stripping and floor finishes is encouraged in new buildings. (Marmoleum is made with natural raw materials and installed with solvent free adhesives.)
* Presently, Housekeeping is using a neutral floor cleaner that is “low foam,” which eliminates the need of a foamer therefore using less chemicals and leaving the machine to use the “green” product exclusively.
* Carpet cleaning accomplished with shampoo sprayed carpet (instead of soaking carpet with chemical cleaners) and then extracted with water. 
* Carpet care systems use a special ""green"" formulation that uses no hazardous chemicals, which means no residues or special handling. It also uses 30 times less water than some wet cleaning methods to exceed water conservation standards outlined by the US Green Building Council.

The plan to address these issues is mapped out in the form of a manual and also includes customer communication protocols and policies that govern quality inspections, powered equipment use and what to do in the event of an emergency.

In 2013, U.Va.’s Building Services department received national certification of its cleaning program by Green Seal, the leading organization that sets the standard for approved cleaning products and programs. As part of that certification, we made a commitment to develop site-specific manuals for most of the academic and public buildings where we provide services

This sample manual provides Standard Operating Procedures in place for cleaning the U.Va. building Minor Hall. Together with individual procedures, it includes specific information that is unique to maintaining the area and surfaces of this particular building, all with the primary purpose of cleaning spaces effectively while protecting human health, the building materials and the environment.

The procedures spelled out and referenced in this manual govern the following:
• cleaning protocols
• chemical handling and tracking requirements
• equipment maintenance and operation procedures
• communication protocols and requirements
• training and inspection programs
• reporting and record keeping procedures

These guidelines form the basis for training of our custodial staff in Minor Hall and a copy has been provided to the Facility Coordinator for the space. All occupants of Minor Hall may access and review the manual at any time. As always, we encourage their input and ideas for improving our program.

•	GS-40 Floor Care Products
•	GS-41 Hand Cleaners and Hand Soaps

Supervision inspects custodial closets weekly to ensure no household non-green chemicals are brought in by housekeepers. In addition to the Green Seal Standards, Building Services utilizes green microfiber technology, CRI (Carpet & Rug Institute) standards for vacuum cleaners, carpet extractors and purchase low decibels cleaning equipment when possible.",True,338000.0,376000.0,True,"Green Seal is the nation’s most recognizable non-profit entity that uses science-based programs to empower consumers and organizations to create a more sustainable world. The number one priority is to create standards that drive ‘cleaning for health’.

In order to reach certification, organizations such as U.Va. Facilities Management Building Services must meet very rigid and complex requirements. Products used must not only be sustainable and safe for people and the environment, they must also equal the quality results of their non-green counterparts. All cleaning procedures and processes must be clearly spelled out and documented to help support consistent, high quality results. Regular and intensive training is a key requirement.

With this certification, U.Va.’s cleaning program becomes one of only three higher education organizations in the country to be awarded this prestigious recognition.

Obtaining Green Seal’s endorsement shows that U.Va. custodial staff are helping to improve the environment, support the good health of employees and customers, and maintaining the buildings across Grounds by following the highest standards in the commercial cleaning industry.

As the first university in the state and third in the nation to achieve GS-42 certification, U.Va., through its cleaning program, has demonstrated that it places a high priority on the health of everyone who enters buildings across Grounds — whether they’re faculty, staff, students or visitors.

As part of achieving Green Seal certification, Building Services showcased its cleaning products and procedures at Bavaro Hall, which was built in 2010. Home to the Curry School of Education, Bavaro Hall spans 48,978 cleanable square feet and is situated at 417 Emmet St. South. The Sheila C. Johnson Clinic for Human Services — which provides integrated clinical services for individuals of all ages — is also located in Bavaro Hall.

Bavaro Hall was selected as our platform building for several reasons, including that the building is already green-friendly by virtue of its LEED gold status. We also felt that we had a strong and highly motivated custodial team in place there. Finally, we believed that the Curry staff would be supportive of the many initiatives that had to be undertaken as part of meeting the standards that resulted in our program's certification.

2014 will see the rest of our educational and general buildings across Grounds follow suit with training starting in February and continuing through the summer. The training methodology is a Train-the-Trainer concept, with front-line top performers and supervisors being trained on both demonstrating and teaching the new procedures, as well as providing oversight to ensure continuing compliance.

The Building Services custodial staff at U.Va. must learn over 50 procedures that set forth the what, when, why and how of cleaning for health. Each staff member takes pride in knowing that their services contribute to the health and well-being of themselves, the environment and all customers.

The most important benefit to our frontline staff is that they are performing their work in a safe environment using products and procedures that minimize any harmful effects from chemicals.

We also hope that as U.Va.’s custodial staff demonstrate doing everything possible to support the health of our faculty, staff and students, they receive the professional recognition and respect that they deserve.",http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/281/6/507/2884/UVA%20Building%20Services.pdf,U.Va.'s internal (not contracted) custodial team is Green Seal certified.,http://www.fm.virginia.edu/depts/operations/greenseal/index.html,Our website URL is  http://www.fm.virginia.edu/depts/operations/buildingservices.html and here can be found descriptions of our top green cleaning initiatives.

A basic screen for environmentally-preferable products is to look for those that are reusable instead of disposable, recyclable, made with renewable energy, and contain a significant percentage of post-consumer waste recycled content. Additionally, third-party certification systems that indicate an environmentally-preferable product include: 
1. “Energy Star”: indicates a product has met strict energy efficiency guidelines as set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy (DOE). 
2. “EPEAT”: indicates electronics that are environmentally-preferable as determined by the EPA and Green Electronics Council. 
3. “FSC-Certified”: indicates products that have met the requirements of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for responsible management of forest resources, such as office paper. 
4. “SCS Recycled Content”: indicates a product that has been certified for recycled content and meets the stringent EPS standard for providing a measurable and significant environmental benefit over typical products in the same category. 
5. “CRI Green Label”: Product certified by the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) to improve indoor air quality. 
6. EPA Design for the Environment (DfE): EPA has screened each ingredient for potential human health and environmental effects and that-based on currently available information, EPA predictive models, and expert judgment-the product contains only those ingredients that pose the least concern among chemicals in their class. 
7. “Green Seal certified”: Products certified by Green Seal to meet environmentally-responsible design, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation requirements.

3.4. Records and documentation for all guidelines, training, occupant feedback, and other strategies must be maintained.

3.5 Quality Assurance / Quality Control- APPA standards have been used to set the expectation for the cleaning service provided. A level 2 has been set as a goal. With individual task frequencies set accordingly. Inspection guidelines have been developed to promote consistency of expectation i.e. individual items per area – baseboards, window sills, corners- floors, corners- walls, corners- ceiling. Parties responsible for quality control are as follows: custodians- self monitor work completed; supervisors- follow up custodians once work is completed, supervisors will have one official  inspection area of a building per day (e.g. classrooms); managers- follow up with the custodians and supervisors once work is completed and to insure consistency among supervisors and custodians, managers will have one official inspection area of a building per day (e.g. “Sample” Hall restrooms on 2nd floor); inspectors- inspectors will follow up with the custodians, supervisors and managers once work is complete to insure consistency among the different groups and to inspect larger areas on an on-going basis (i.e. one building, all areas per day). Inspection items are either acceptable or unacceptable and will generate a passing (above 80%) or failing percentage grade (below 80%) for the area inspected (i.e. “Sample” Hall 2nd floor restroom 205- 87%).  Items that failed will be noted i.e. mirror is spotted; partition walls had graffiti. This information is then passed along to the supervisor to assign the task for completion. Inspections will be gathered for the week to generate an overall grade for the building, as well as a building area grade i.e. “Sample” hall restrooms 87%. Monthly building grades and building area grades will be tracked on a weekly and monthly basis to develop a tracking system to monitor progress.

What is Green Cleaning?
Green Cleaning is defined as cleaning to protect health without harming the environment.  Green Cleaning is a new cleaning movement that takes into account: (1) the health, safety, and environmental risks of products and processes associated with cleaning; (2) the mission and use of the facility to be cleaned and the behavior of the facility occupants; and (3) the cleaning, maintenance, and sanitation needs of the facility and its occupants. 

In other words, it is an approach to cleaning that involves the use of alternative products, procedures, and equipment to reduce environmental and health risks while maintaining a satisfactory level of cleanliness.

Why do we Green Clean?
Studies have shown that facilities that go green have healthier occupants and employees, higher worker productivity, lower operating costs, and a positive environmental impact.

Green cleaning helps improve indoor air quality and reduce health problems that traditional products and processes can cause.  With green cleaning building occupants experience fewer incidences of irritations or sensitivities to the indoor environment.

Healthier employees mean happier employees.  Statistics show worker satisfaction, improved morale, reduced absenteeism and increased productivity and efficiency can occur when a facility is maintained using green cleaning processes and chemicals.  Employees and customers appreciate knowing that green practices are used in the building they occupy. A green cleaning program also helps WMU be the environmentally conscious university it is.

Green cleaning has the same effectiveness as traditional cleaning, and has little or no cost increase; the return on investment for switching to green cleaning is immense.

The bigger picture associated with green cleaning is that it is better for the environment.  In the United States, commercial buildings consume 17% of the water, 33% of the energy, 40% of the raw materials, and 71% of the electricity.  They produce, directly or indirectly, 40% of the landfill waste, 33% of the carbon dioxide, 49% of the sulfur dioxide and 10% of the particulate emissions.

When we take on the responsibility of switching to green cleaning and other green building practices, together we, as a university and a world, can make an enormous improvement to our overall environment...and that is why we green clean.

How do we Green Clean?
Building Custodial & Support Services achieves green cleaning through the use of green equipment, processes, and products.

Employing the use of green equipment and processes saves energy and increases productivity.  BC&SS uses several different types of equipment that allows for buildings to be cleaned effectively, while also promoting sustainability.  These items and processes include: 

- KaiVac Cleaning Systems
- CRI Vacuums
- Clarke CR28 BOOST Rider
- Strive Rider with Ready Space Automatic Extractors
- RODI (Reverse Osmosis De-Ionizing) window cleaning system

WMU has switched to the use of green paper products within BC&SS.  Toilet paper is 20% post-consumer waste and paper towels are 100% post-consumer waste as well as 100% recycled fiber.  BC&SS also has an ongoing donation program of partial paper product rolls to community service organizations.

A primary component of a green cleaning operation besides the guidelines and products in use above is the introduction of micro fiber cleaning technology in the form of micro wipes (cleaning/dusting cloths), micro fiber wet/damp flat mop pads, micro fiber dust mops, micro fiber dusting sleeves, and micro fiber floor finish applicator pads.

Many cleaning tasks can be preformed using water as the cleaning agent (97% reduction in hard surface bacteria, fungi and viruses).  Reduced chemical product use is another component of greening your program.

    Recent additions to the green cleaning tool box (2008 - 2009) are floor scrubbers using only H2O and no chemical products , trials  using baking soda and vinegar for general cleaning, and use of low moisture scrubbers and carpet cleaners.

The success of this goal requires the continual re-assessing of buildings, products, techniques, and staffing. There are several ways in which this goal is being achieved.
We use environmentally friendly equipment of the newest technology, such as vacuums that have filtration systems which will filter down to 0.5 microns. This equipment helps reduce all allergy discomfort and helps to provide improved air quality throughout WPI's facilities. We use only environmentally friendly cleaning products in East Hall, our LEED Gold Certified resident hall, and we recommend environmentally friendly cleaning products elsewhere on campus. We also educate our staff on the proper use of disinfectants and other chemicals, which helps to reduce lost time due to common seasonal illnesses.
