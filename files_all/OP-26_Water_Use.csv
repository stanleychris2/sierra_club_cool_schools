If there is something suspicious with the irrigation - (ex. excessive water flow in a certain zone) the system alerts a grounds operator who is dispatched to the field to correct the issue (repair/replace flow heads, pipes, etc). The campus is divided into 600 irrigation zones. Data is collected for each zone and the irrigation zones are tailored to this data. 

Additionally, rain cans are used to measure rain. Using these rain cans, irrigation can be completely turned off when there is sufficient rain fall. The system also takes plant types in the zones into consideration since plants have different water requirements. Additionally, visual observation by the grounds keeping crew helps identify problems and trigger corrective actions.

","Nearly all of Arizona State University Polytechnic campus grounds deploy a xeriscape technique with the exception of only a few small plots which we cultivate social gathering lawn spaces. A large majority of the land the campus rests on is still virgin desert while the maintained core of the campus remains true to the Sonoran desert pallet; palo verde, mesquite, saquaro, cresote and prickly pear are just some of the many native plants you'll encounter on campus grounds. Careful placement and hardscaping coupled with their drought tolerant characteristic allows us to limit, and in many cases completely eliminate, the use of irrigated water.","The Tempe campus specifies Calsense controllers for all new installations and renovations. 

The Polytechnic campus also uses the water management system called Calsense. This system calculates water requirements from an initially established baseline which is programmed for desert adapted plants. It measures rain fall and adjusts metering as needed in addition to accounting for time of day and the evapotranspiration rates for the landscaped vegetation. The current system monitors a substantial portion of the campus core. Coverage equals approximately 1,007,376 square feet which is a substantial portion of our campus. The majority is left wild and plans for switching the rest of the scaped areas include reliance on weather gages to ensure optimal water use.

Preventative maintenance is also used as a way of reducing water leaks, and overall usage by using equipment that is up-to-date and in proper working condition. ","California State University Channel Islands (CI) has developed a strategy that uses xeriscaping techniques with the goal to decrease the amount of existing lawn area & irrigation, minimize the required maintenance of planting areas adjacent to buildings, and provide an opportunity to educate people about the appropriateness of these types of plants in maintaining a sustainable campus grounds.  This strategy has been completed across approximately a quarter of the campus grounds that are currently actively maintained,  with plans to continue across the remainder of the core campus through funding from adjacent capital projects.  A new native plant field was installed last year behind the new Broome Library as a pilot project to provide an area for people to enjoy and learn more about the native species prevalent in the region.  An existing cactus garden was transplanted to an adjacent tract of land at the University Town Center that abuts the base of the coastal Santa Monica Mountain Range. Additional native gardens have been added around campus to areas like courtyards between buildings, and quads. 
The landscaping at the new entrance road finished in 2012, utilizes similar techniques that will achieve the goals stated above.  This includes native grasses planted along the new levee system, restoration of a native riparian habitat along the adjacent Long Grade Creek, development of wetland areas, and landscaping along the main road that uses native and drought-tolerant plant species.  Across this entire area, minimal to no irrigation is needed because of the drought- tolerant native flora planted. In the front of the Broome Library, there are Californian and Mexican desert plants.  Due to the adaption of these plants to this region, less water is needed; therefore, CI installed low precipitation rate spray heads. Plans to convert to turf/grass in the North and South quads to native vegetation will further lower watering rates on campus. 

",California State University Channel Islands utilizes and applies weather data to adjust irrigation. We also employ evaptransporation techniques to cut down water rates. ,"Positive shut-off valves on hoses are a standard practice; other practices include  no washing of campus vehicles unless absolutely necessary; we have also stopped pressure washing buildings and windows, and employ recycled water in every place appropriate. Conferences and Events has stopped allowing groups that use our facilities to play water games which has cut down on unnecessary waste.

Condensation in University, Medical Center and Health System cooling systems is reclaimed for use in Duke's Chilled Water Plant's cooling towers.  Cooling tower blowdown water is sent through an RO system and reused in cooling towers.

Water from the Asiatic Arboretum pond in Sarah P. Duke Gardens is used to water seasonal plants in the terrace beds of the Gardens.  Additionally, in the Charlotte Brody Discovery Garden at Duke Gardens, rainwater is collected to water the surrounding landscape.  Duke Gardens staff have also hosted workshops focused on rainwater harvesting at home.

The Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering, Medicine and Applied Sciences (FCIEMAS), which opened in 2004, has a 70,000-gallon cistern underground to collect rainwater that is used to irrigate the nearly two-acre complex.

Duke has multiple cisterns installed across campus that collectively hold approximately 260,000 gallons of stormwater.  Water from cisterns is used primarily for irrigation.

Drought-tolerant plants and green roofs on campus with succulents are significant examples of these efforts. Ornamental stones are used to hold water, manage runoff, avoid rutting, and prevent weeds. These projects are self-sufficient once they are established, making them an economically efficient investment in sustainable practices.

In the Duke Gardens, water conservation is a high priority and xeriscaping plays a large role in plant decisions. Plants are preferred that require little irrigation once established, and plants that need more water are sited appropriately for efficient water use.  Proper mulching is also a standard procedure for all planting areas. 
","Rain sensors are an ordinance in the city of Durham. After a quarter inch of rain, programmed irrigation systems at Duke University shut down. The Duke Gardens and the new Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center site have Smart Controllers for their irrigation systems. The irrigation system for the Doris Duke Center is currently controlled by a ‘smart’ control valve.  This system has sensors that respond to recent rainfall and adjusts the duration of irrigation accordingly based on soil moisture.  
Where feasible, Duke University Grounds and Sarah P. Duke Gardens use drip irrigation to further conserve water used for landscape irrigation.","Recent Initiatives

A new reclamation pond will collect rainwater and runoff from 22 percent of the main campus area for use in a nearby chilled water plant, which pumps water across campus to cool buildings.  The pond is expected to save about 100 million gallons of potable water a year.  Duke is also helping to improve the watershed it relies on through a stream restoration project on campus.

Conservation measures identified by a water audit of 6 buildings in 2012 are expected to produce an 8 million gallon reduction in water consumption each year at Duke. 

Sustained Conservation

Through dedicated efforts on campus, Duke reduced its water use by 50 percent month over month from the previous year during the drought.  In the years following the drought, there has been an estimated sustained reduction in water consumption of 35 percent.  While many of the measures below were first initiated during the drought, they continue to contribute to sustained water conservation on campus.

Conservation Measures – Buildings

Earlham College follows the practices of Xeriscaping throughout its campus buildings and grounds. From www.eartheasy.com there are 7 practices of Xeriscaping.
 
1.	 Reducing the use of water: Each plant is chosen for the location of the building with regards to the direction and the sun. Mulch is used routinely, and no irrigation system is in place we water by hand only when necessary.
2.	 Soil improvement: we use cow manure and peat moss while planting the chosen flowers, mulching each year to retain the soil quality, and choose organic fertilizers when necessary.
3.	 Create Limited turf: with a campus as large as we are we have a hard time creating limited turf area however we do plant trees and have a large amount of trees on campus to help with the area and create a canopy. We also mulch the leaves during the fall to help promote the soil.
4.	 Choose the right plants: We try to us drought friendly and native hardy plants wherever possible we use natural grasses, succulents, Native plants, and wildflowers along with conifers to create a show of color for each building. While choosing annuals we use marigolds,
5.	 Mulch we use several tons of mulch per year to all our areas of landscaping. It is applied at least 3 inches thick and placed around all plants to help keep in moisture. We use mulch from a wholesale dealer in Indiana
6.	 Irrigate: we only hand irrigate when necessary.
7.	 Maintain your landscape: we have a crew that constantly maintains the landscaping of the college. In drought conditions we do not mow the grass and let it grow and we weed regularly by hand or by low grade chemicals.
 
Other comments: while construction is involved on campus we try to maintain areas of top soil from being removed and put into place erosion control barriers. We buy our plants from reputable dealers that field raise their plants. On steep slopes we try when possible to leave natural or plant erosion controlling plants. Our mowing height is around 2-3 inches and we do not pick up the clippings but let lay to decompose back into the ground. And when at all possible we use IPM to deter pests from becoming a problem.","Irrigation is only used on the Athletic Fields, and the sprinkler system is attached to a rain gauge that prevents the system from operating if there has been a measurable amount of rain.

All residence hall faucets and toilets are low flow. As fixtures need to be replaced they are replaced with low flow features. All toilet and urinals on campus are low flow. In the Science Building there are also waterless urinals. ,"Within the Science Building and three of the dormitories there are waterless urinals. Each waterless urinal saves an average of 40,000 gallons (151,000 liters) of fresh, potable water each year. That’s the equivalent of 3 large, home swimming pools. 

The fuel cell on campus at the Science building is designed to operate in water balance, the fuel cell requires no consumption or discharge of water under normal operations. The fuel cell saves over 3.8 million gallons of water annually—enough water to fill nearly six Olympic swimming pools. 

Eastern's heat plant used to use water to cool down, but now utilizes air to cool down conserving water. ","In front of Eastern's Science Building there is a bioswale which includes native vegetation, pervious pavement and rainwater collection system of troughs. At one of the lower points on campus during rain events, storm water runs off toward the Science Building and is slowed down by planted vegetation on steep slopes, pervious pavement and bioswale collection.  

Eastern's landscape is designed to enhance native plants which require less energy intensive practices, low to no-use of fertilizers, and incorporates storm water management practices throughout. From adding vegetative surfaces into parking areas, to added vegetation on steep slopes, there are few places on campus that experience flooding. 
",Eastern has rain sensors installed on irrigation systems around campus. This means that there is no over-watering or water wasted during rainy times. ,,http://www1.easternct.edu/sustainability/green-buildings/,"Total water usage data was collected from Sue Kennedy, and facts about the fuel cell were verified from case studies about the fuel cell energy use etc from ISE.

We’ve also upgraded our irrigation efficiency by using water from Furman Lake. That change alone covers 30 percent of our irrigation needs.",,"In the past decade, Furman has used a number of different LID practices and products on a multitude of projects – both new and renovation. These include: structural grass pavement and gravel pavement, porous concrete pavement, pervious brick pavement (with underdrain filtration), rainwater harvesting and storage for irrigation, detention ponds, grass filtration strips, buffers on both sides of Little Creek, and manufactured structures such as catch basin inserts, cyclone separators and offset bay separators. And, of course, the new Synthetic Turf Football Field that catches and slows the runoff rate, cleans the stormwater of sediment, and does not require the use of nutrients that damage the environment.

Some areas of campus are maintained with xeriscape landscaping techniques, including drought tolerant and native species as appropriate. The area surrounding Cliffs Cottage, the Susan Shi ornamental garden, is a highlight of the university's xeriscaped landscape. Other areas of campus which employ xeriscape techniques include the landscape at Farmer Hall, our new Child Development Center, Tennis Center, Track Infield, and several recreation fields on campus.

At the Shi Center, we harvest rainwater coming off of the high-pitched roof into gutters, which flow into downspouts and then proceed through underground pipes headed for the 12,000 gallon capacity cisterns.  In addition, any excess water flowing from the gutters flows down 2 water chains on  each side of the porch, which flow into successive bog (rain) gardens before finally reaching our lake.

  The water collected from the cisterns is used primarily to water the Susan Shi garden.  The water from the rain chains flows into 3 small bog (rain) gardens (6 total) located below the porch.  From there, they  are directed underground into the large bog before reaching our lake (after filtering impurities).  Various water loving plants are sustained in our bog gardens which create an environment for numerous bugs, insects and wildlife (plants such as iris', grasses, hibiscus, dwarf horse tail, cat tails, rush, etc.)  In essence, a bog (rain garden) mimics a marsh, which is nature's way of filtering dirty water into clean water for the environment, while at the same time providing food and habitat for all of earth's inhabitants.

The university has several on-campus gardens that use rain barrels or cisterns to collect rain water for reuse in the gardens.  For one large building the university uses untreated ground water for irrigation.

The university also has a certified LEED Sustainable Site which was a former parking lot, now a green space, with a rain water collection system and rain barrels to irrigate the grass and plants, and for source water for a fountain. As part of the project planning and management process, the GW Operations Team seized the opportunity to make GW’s urban campus even more environmentally friendly. They embarked on a process to create a plaza on Square 80 that would be beautiful, enjoyable, and acts as an urban resource that protects the Potomac Watershed. Permeable brick pavers include an under-tray system used to collect rainfall.  Three below-ground cisterns totaling 33,000 gallons hold the rainwater.  Runnels capture non-permeable hard-scape run-off and direct it into tree pits and planters.  Rooftop water is diverted from adjacent buildings into the cistern system.  Where parking is required by zoning laws, Grass-Pave™ is installed and planted with Buffalo grass.  All plantings are native (70%) and adapted (30%) species, further reducing water demand.  The fountain draws from the cistern system, and auto shuts-off when the water supply runs low. 

The GW Law Learning Center has one 6,000 gal cistern that is being used to irrigate the Center's surrounding property.  Another 16,500 gallon cistern holds storm water back from the sewer during rain events and releases it slowly to the sewer.

In addition, the newly-constructed Milken Institute School of Public Health captures 8,796 gallons of graywater for reuse in all bathrooms for flushing, within the building that makes up approximately 4,682 square feet in total, making up 28% of the buildings square footage.

GW's newly-constructed Science and Engineering Hall also has a water reuse system to store rainwater in a cistern for reuse later in the toilets throughout the building.",Water coming into all university-owned buildings is metered.  Most campus buildings are separately metered although a few adjoining buildings share a meter.

Most meters are owned and maintained by local water distribution companies while a few submeters owned by the university are also used.,"In January 2015, during the reporting year, all toilets in the International House residence hall were replaced from an older model using several gallons per flush to a low-flow model.  In August 2015, just after the end of the reporting year, toilets were replaced or rebuilt (to reduce water usage) in three more residence halls.","In the Ross Hall boiler room a new type of air compressor was installed that does not need continuous cooling water flowing through it.  The old air compressors had a 24/7 cooling load where the cooling water was discharged directly to the sewer.

In residence halls we typically replace water fixtures as they fail with low-flow-rated fixtures.  During the performance year, GW replaced all of the toilets in the International House residence hall.","As part of GW's Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy, the university will promote non-invasive/drought-resistant/adaptive/native plants on university grounds, using the following criteria for plantings - appearance, adaptability, security, and survivability.

The seven principles of Xeriscaping are a central part of the landscape planning at GW.
Proper water usage, plant selection, and cultural practices are essential for the success of any urban landscape. Large-scale irrigation systems and areas requiring frequent watering are not efficient on a campus with large amounts of foot traffic, so proper planning and appropriate plant selection is essential.

Example: Outside the entrance to Lisner Hall, there is a very shallow, dry planting bed. The building eaves, large existing trees, depth of the planting bed, and ambient heat radiating from the concrete vault surrounding the bed were all taken in consideration when planning this planting. Previously, plantings required consistent irrigation to thrive, requiring the use of additional water and employee time. The solution was to fill the shallow, well-drained beds with Prickly Pear Cactus (Optunia ssp), an incredibly tough Southwest US native cactus. The cactus thrive in the dry heat, require little care, flower prolifically, and have since been used to acquire cuttings to establish cactus beds in similar dry, hot areas, especially on the south side of buildings with large overhangs that block all precipitation. This is an example of using a species best adapted to the area being planted to reduce water and labor input.","By using native and adaptive species of plant material, GW has eliminated in-ground irrigation around our LEED-certified buildings.  GW installed seven soil moisture detectors during the previous performance year (FY14) to more efficiently irrigate several particular public-meeting-and-event areas.","Until the previous reporting period (FY14) the university had a boiler room with air compressors cooled by once-through potable water; we now cool this equipment with a closed-loop chilled water line.

During this reporting period the university started remotely monitoring for the first time temperatures on selected steam traps to determine when they fail and begin to lose steam.",http://sustainability.gwu.edu/water-sustainability,--

Renovations to SAGE Hall in 2009 prioritized responsible water usage. Low-flow showerheads, sink aerators and dual-flush toilets were installed.

In Spring 2009, students Ben Jankowski and Ronnie Black used a Student Campus Greening Fund grant to purchase and replace 2.5 gallon per minute showerheads in residence hall showers with high efficiency 1.5 gallon per minute showerheads. These new showerheads use 40% less water per minute than the old system. 

In the fall of 2014, a student project began exploring the possibility of replacing the already low efficiency shower heads with even more efficient heads, and using a model that can easily be adjusted by students allowing for varying degrees of pressure and for the ability to pause the flow so that students can lather up before continuing. The student researchers are currently collecting data to see how much additional water can be saved. ","In an effort to reduce waste and minimize support for the commodification of water, GMC banned the sale of bottled water on campus in 2014. The move came after a student-led campaign that garnered signatures from over 25% of the student body. ","The vast majority of cultivated vegetation on campus continues to be native species that are well-adapted to the climate and need no irrigation.

Several buildings use non-potable water for other purposes. Examples include: 5 Cowperthwaite St. and Wasserstein Hall capture ground and roof water to be utilize for irrigation.	The Sherman Fairchild Building uses re-captured “gray” water from laboratory processes on-site for toilet flushing.

Rainwater harvesting is employed by Harvard in many buildings, including undergraduate housing and the new Harvard Art Museums. The rainwater is stored in underground cisterns and reused for toilets and irrigation. The first three construction/renovation projects in Harvard's historic House Renewal (undergraduate dorms) have stormwater retention systems that recapture rainwater for use in irrigation and/or toilets. The total capacity of all three tanks is over 27,000 gallons. 

The Harvard Art Museums an innovative water-recovery system collects rainwater from the museums and neighboring Carpenter Center and diverts it to a 10,000-gallon underground cistern. The reclaimed water, which otherwise would be discharged to the surrounding storm sewers at a daily rate of 21,600 gallons, is instead used for irrigation, gray water in toilets, and to recharge the underground water table

The gray water system used at 5 Cowperthwaite is a 32,800 gallon tank that collects storm water from the roof for use in irrigation.","All buildings employ some form of water metering. All buildings on campus are metered individually with respect to water/sewer consumption. Some projects include separate metering for irrigation, kitchen, boiler, DHW, and other end-uses.","Harvard University's Green Building Standards require compliance with LEED credits concerning low-flow fixtures for a minimum 35% reduction in water use below EPAct 1992 baselines

LMU understands this dilemma and has make great strides in conserving water across the entire campus. The city of LA entered water restrictions in 2009, LMU decided to go above and beyond these water restrictions based on our environmental commitments as a university. Our reclaimed water system was actually adopted by LADWP to use as a community system. 

The WateReuse Association selected LMU as the 2010 WateReuse Customer of the Year. Currently, 75% of LMU’s irrigation needs are supplied by reclaimed water. LMU implemented a hydrogen peroxide treatment station in 2008 which produces odorless, clean water for use on campus landscapes.This technology has been since adapated by LADWP and used for municipal reclaimed water treatment a testament to our design!

Most of the campus doesn't have meters for water. One of the meters covers at least one building.  We have 7 campus water meters 1 for lower campus 4 for upper campus and 2 for reclaimed water.   We have weather station that controls irrigation based on weather. Seven irrigation zones are run by flow control to avoid excessive water loss given a break in the system.  Timers for irrigation. We base water use of evaporation rates. An initiative is currently being worked on to add more detailed water meters across campus buildings.

Washers: All campus laundry facilities had the washers upgraded to front loading models using 50% less water and electricity than the previous top loaders.
Toilets: For restrooms, all new construction and renovation work use 1/8 gallon per flush (gpf) urinals and 1.28 gpf water closets. Due to a mix of rebates and incentives, the recent replacement of urinals across campus with water-efficient models cost the university almost nothing, and energy savings, in addition to thousands of gallons of water annually, will be realized within the first month of installation.
Showers: All showerheads in residential dormitories have been replaced with low-flow efficient models.

LMU subscribes to this ""landscape ethic"" by using drought-resistant plants for much of the campus landscaping. Such plants are acclimated to the Southern California climate and require little or no irrigation. Over the last six years LMU has focused only on installing drought tolerant plants and removing water intensive green space. Removed about 1 1/2 acres of turf in the past year alone to replace with drought tolerant landscaping.

","Campus irrigation uses RainMaster sprinklers to further conserve water consumption. The control-based sprinkler system utilizes weather-based logic in addition to data taking into account such variables as type of surface and slope in order to minimize runoff. Effective irrigation methods can reduce water consumption to 2.0 gallons per hour as compared to older traditional irrigation which could use up to 1 gallon per minute. Weather information is based off onsite weather station. We also conserve water when it rains but shutting off systems also based on this weather system on campus.

The system is tied back to a controller and remains off except during hot, dry spells. The spray heads used in the irrigation system reduce Loyola's water use by 30%. 

Watering takes place during early morning hours when evaporation rates are the lowest
During dry spells, grass and other vegetation are watered only three days a week with varying times of 3-5 minutes to 15-20 minutes. Each zone in the irrigation system has a rain sensor that shuts down watering if rain is detected. Due to the ""smart"" system that senses moisture due to rainfall, the irrigation system was used only once in August during a cool, wet summer in 2010.","We have addressed a number of our water intense mechanical systems.

Reduced watering schedules Since 2004, the College has significantly reduced the watering schedule for campus landscaping, down to a base for two times per week (aside from athletic turf, which must be watered daily due to different maintenance requirements). Watering occurs more than twice a week when weather or other conditions require it.

Grounds installed pressure regulators on irrigation equipment in order to reduce water use. ","The Pomona College Open Space and Landscape Guidelines contain a section on irrigation and water conservation, prescribing the use of the college weather system, drip irrigation, and deep root watering systems wherever feasible. The section on Planting also requires the identification of areas for possible turf removal and replacement by drought-tolerant plantings. The College has already began systematically planting drought-tolerant vegetation and native plants. For instance: in Summer 2009, 1,428 square feet of turf was removed and replaced by drip irrigated plants and 21,179 square feet of shrubs were replaced with mulch.

Additionally, permeable pavement and drainage areas have been constructed on sites such as the Sontag Greek Theater and the new North Campus Residence Halls.",http://pomona.edu/administration/sustainability/initiatives/water/efforts.aspx,"Pomona College's master plan calls for the removal of parking from the interior of campus to improve pedestrian access and green areas.  Since 2011, three major parking lots have been removed and drought tolerant plants put in their place.  This removal of impermeable ground improves the groundwater recharge when it rains, yet does require additional water, particularly to get the native plants established in the first few years.  Additionally, Claremont and the rest of California suffer from the drought with only 6 of our usual 13-17 inches of rain falling last fiscal year.

Since the early 2000s, smart timers, soil probes, and rain gauges have been used for even more precision and conservation.  The department is responsible for over 1.9 million square feet of turf and over 680,000 square feet of shrub and flowerbeds.  The irrigation systems on campus contain 67 control units, over 600 in-ground control valves, and more than 10,000 irrigation heads.  The Grounds Department recently installed a new centralized irrigation control system that allows the control units to be set remotely and to incorporate weather data to help determine how much water is required.  The system includes a weather station that automatically adjusts the irrigation based upon the weather.

In the fall of 2008, Rice began capturing condensate water from the air conditioning systems of the Biosciences Research Collaborative to use as make-up water in the cooling towers of the South Plant.  This is a free source of water that Rice would otherwise have to buy from the City of Houston during the summer of 2011, Rice completed a project to capture condensate water from many of the science buildings to bring back to the Central Plant's cooling towers.  Combined, these systems are estimated to save at least 12 million gallons of water per year, which is equivalent to about 5 to 6 percent of Rice's annual water consumption in a typical year.","Several Rice buildings are individually metered for building-level water consumption, including (but not limited to) Alice Pratt Brown, Dell Butcher Hall, The Rice Stadium, the Greenbriar building, McNair Hall, the Rice Children’s Campus, the Gibbs Recreation and Wellness Center, the Biosciences Research Collaborative, and the President’s House. Otherwise, many buildings are served from master meters.  Irrigation water is typically metered separately.  ","(1) Dual–flush toilets are located in Duncan College, McMurtry College, the Biosciences Research Collaborative, Brockman Hall, and the Gibbs Recreation Center. There are more than 405 dual-flush toilets on campus. The toilets have two options, full flush and partial flush. Full flushes use 1.6 gallons of water and partial flushes, which vary between buildings due to toilet model, use either .8 or 1.1 gallons of water. It is estimated that 788,715 gallons of water per year will be saved because of the dual-flush toilets. 

(2) During the spring of 2011, the Rice Housing and Dining department partnered with the student eco-rep for Hanszen College to test a new showerhead that reduces water consumption by 40 percent with an economic payback of just a few months. The student and his roommates reported that the low-flow showerhead provided a better shower than the showerhead it replaced. With student support, during the summer of 2011, both Hanszen and Lovett Colleges were retrofitted with these new showerheads.

The BMP garden includes 3 rain barrels, 2 biorentention areas and a pervious path. 

As part of the construction of SLU’s Doisy Research Center in 2008, approximately 7,200 square feet of vegetative roof was installed on the 212,000 square foot building. The roof is an extensive system (4”) and is planted with five (5) varieties of sedum. These varieties were chosen based on their survival capacity and adaptability to a vegetative roof environment in the Midwest (Missouri) climate. 

In addition, Grounds Services uses more sustainable grasses, like Fescue, in new installations. Fescue grasses are drought tolerant, require less fertilizer, develop a deep root system and are more heat resistant. This type of grass also requires less chemical application to treat and maintain. New Installations include: Medical Center Recreation Stadium, Chaifetz Arena, Education Union, & Doisy Research Center.","All irrigation systems separate turf zones from shrub and perennial zones to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful watering.

It is the year the campus refers to for all water-based comparisons reported internally and externally. Stanford has traditionally tracked its water consumption by fiscal year; however, since the inception of the drought in California in January 2014, Stanford has monitored its water consumption even more closely than in previous years, allowing for easy calculation of calendar year data. Because of this, Stanford has opted to use calendar year 2015 as its performance year, since that data reflects the most current state of Stanford's water consumption and conservation efforts. ",--,--,"INDOOR USE OF RECYCLED WATER:
Until April 2015, the service area for Stanford's reclaimed-water facility was more than 1 million GSF. Cooling tower blowdown at the Central Energy Facility provided water for toilet and urinal flushing in the Science and Engineering Quad and Graduate School of Business, as well as several School of Medicine buildings. However, since the campus moved to its new energy system in April 2015, evaporative cooling towers are only needed approximately 20 days out of the year since the waste heat is recovered and inserted into the hot water loop for building heating. Because of this, the new Central Energy Facility is 70% more water efficient than the old cogeneration plant, and campus potable water has decreased by 15% overall. These efficiency gains also mean that the supply of recycled water has diminished.

IRRIGATION WITH SURFACE WATER:
Approximately 85% of Stanford's irrigation water comes from nonpotable lake water collected in two campus reservoirs. Landscaped areas are irrigated via the university's lake water system and allows Stanford to preserve potable water for domestic, research, academic, and academic support facility use.

REVERSE OSMOSIS REUSE AT SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
Existing reverse osmosis (RO) wastewater is being reused for quenching (reducing the temperature) of the 180F wastewater from new cage washing equipment. Water savings from RO reuse is estimated around 180,000 gallons/year.","All buildings on Stanford's campus are individually metered for water consumption. In addition, most buildings have a separate outdoor irrigation meter. This information has provided the necessary level of detail to enable Stanford to reduce domestic water consumption significantly since 2000, despite campus growth. ","Over the past 15 years, Stanford has replaced more than 12,000 academic and student housing bathroom fixtures with water-efficient fixtures, including low-flow showerheads, sink aerators, high efficiency toilets and urinals. Almost 90% of the academic and student housing inefficient toilets have been retrofitted.
Additionally, in 2014, Stanford Dining replaced water fixtures such as kitchen sprayers in all of its dining halls, which allowed the department to reduce its water consumption by 9%. ","(1) In February 2015, Stanford Residential & Dining Enterprises (R&DE) approved installation of new sprinkler heads on all R&DE maintained lawns (primarily around Student Housing facilities). The project was completed in May 2015 and has led to a 46% reduction in R&DE's water consumption, which equates to 33 million gallons of water saved. 
(2) Since May 2008, Stanford Utilities Services has provided 363 rebates to Faculty/Staff for installing residents’ high efficiency toilets or clothes washers and over 95 water wise house call inspections. 
(3) 77 water misers (devices that monitor the steam condensate temperature and apply cold water only when needed as opposed to continuous flow) have been installed on campus autoclaves and steam sterilizers. 
(4) All once-through cooling for equipment has been replaced with re-circulating systems.
(5) Replaced single pass water seal vacuum pumps at the School of Medicine, Herrin and Mudd Chemistry labs with new efficient equipment.
","Stanford’s landscape design guidelines encourage selecting drought-resistant plants and discourage planting water-intensive turf lawns unless absolutely necessary.  As part of Stanford’s Water Conservation Master Plan, selected water-intensive landscape areas were retrofitted with lower water-use plant materials.  A Water Wise Garden serves as an educational model for the entire campus community regarding native and drought-tolerant plants (http://bgm.stanford.edu/groups/grounds/special/waterwise). In addition, the majority of campus irrigation occurs at night to minimize evaporation loss.","Stanford uses a Maxicom central control system throughout most irrigated landscape areas on campus.  Based on evapotranspiration and weather station data, computers at the Grounds Department calculate sprinkler run times and communicate irrigation schedules to field controllers which automatically run the sprinklers. The sprinklers used for landscape manages by Residential & Dining Enterprises are also weather-controlled. ","(1) From 2011 to present, Stanford Utilities Services has installed >30 real time water monitoring devices on existing meters and implemented Best Management Practices (BMPs) to ensure new landscaping and buildings are working efficiently. Real time monitoring has also improved responsiveness to leaks and reduced the amount of time that leaks go unnoticed.
(2) Stanford created a demonstration program to test new water efficient equipment and fixtures for campus-wide applications for new and existing facilities.

http://sustainable.stanford.edu/resources/2013-2014-sustainability-stanford-year-review

(2) The area of so-called ""vegetated grounds"" in acres has not changed substantially since 2000. Stanford's lands are vast (8180 acres) and the building footprint / hardscape (approximately 1182 acres) has not varied significantly. Negligible changes to the vegetated grounds are further confirmed through Stanford's General Use Permit and the accompanying Sustainable Development Study.

During this same period of time, the campus population increased.  One of the possible reasons for the increase in water use is the change in the methodology used to track water.  Until 2013, SUNY New Paltz tracked water use by taking visual readings of meters at each building on a monthly basis.  Now, badger water meters have been installed and real time data is uploaded into our centralized online building management and metering system.  The college is assessing the reliability of these new meters, which have reported unusually high readings for short periods of time (i.e. a three or two month period) for certain meters during the 2013-14 performance year.  These high readings for a few meters for a few months at a time explain the ~ 2.4 million gallon increase in SFY 2013-14.  Every other year's water use prior to the 2013-14 academic year shows substantially less water use:
SFY 2008-9 - 36,961,717 gallons
SFY 2009-10 - 36,644,879 gallons
SFY 2010-11 - 35,278,187 gallons
SFY 2011-12 - 35,530,923 gallons
SFY 2012-13 - 36,796,812 gallons
SFY 2013-14 - 38,673,933 gallons

It is likely that the water data for the 2013-14 academic year is incorrect.  The Office of Campus Sustainability is piloting a smart valve in one building that is anticipated to improve water meter data quality.

SUNY New Paltz only tracks total water use and does not break down water use between potable and non-potable water uses.

The number of residential students in the baseline year was not available at the time of submission, so we assumed that the number of students that lived on campus in the performance year was the same as the baseline year.

The use of drought tolerant plants is particularly emphasized in new landscapes developed as part of new road or building construction projects. When existing landscapes must be modified the decision to utilize drought tolerant plants depends on the surrounding context and budget constraints. 

The campus has also recently completed a Landscape Management Plan which functions as a tool for evaluating existing campus landscapes and identifying those that are suitable for conversion, typically to xeriscape, because the maintenance levels and water required to retain those landscapes is out of balance with the use or purpose of the landscape. This effort is being spearheaded by the Public Garden Pilot Project Team composed of campus staff from the Arboretum, Campus Planning and Landscape Architecture, Grounds, the Riparian Reserve, and Civil and Industrial Services.

The UC Davis Arboretum also has a very well-developed sustainable horticulture program with a significant community outreach component (Arboretum All-Stars) whose main purpose is to promote ""valley-wise"" gardening - which is the use of plants that are climate appropriate for the Sacramento Valley. Where possible, plants from the Arboretum's ""All-Stars"" list are specified in planting plans for campus projects designed in-house, and consultants are encouraged by campus staff to consider selecting plants from this palette as well in their design work.

","Water use has stayed relatively flat over the past 40 years, and on a per-capita basis, campus water use has been decreasing for many years due to aggressive conservation measures and an on-going commitment by the campus to use water wisely. Key actions are summarized below.
Design & Construction Management has revised the Campus Standards and Design Guide for new construction and building renovations to:
·         Eliminate single-pass cooling for laboratory equipment
·         Meter water use by building for benchmarking
·         Require low-flow fixtures, ultra-low-flow urinals, and bottle-filling (hydration) stations
·         Require water-conservative landscaping, water efficient irrigation, and application of heavy mulch to landscaped areas to reduce evaporation.
Facilities Management has:
·         Replaced nearly all single-pass systems in favor of closed-loop systems for equipment cooling
·         Approximately 1/3rd of the campus fixtures have been replaced with low-flow versions, with retrofits occurring at the time of fixture breakage or facility remodels/renovations
·         Student employees in the LEED-EBOM program investigate for leaks and water saving opportunities in buildings that are part of the LEED-EBOM program (two dorms, two office buildings, one classroom building, three labs)
·         Campus cooling towers have been retrofitted with Dolphin valves for water efficiency during flushing
·         Most steam condensate leaks have been repaired, and when new ones arise, they are repaired as quickly as possible.
Grounds and Landscape Services has taken many measures over the last 10 years to reduce campus landscape water consumption, including:
·         Turf reduction and drought-tolerant landscaping installation
·         Widespread mulching
·         Aggressive irrigation preventative maintenance
·         Stormwater swales that collect rainwater
·         Subsurface turf irrigation at Student Housing facilities, and
·         The operation of a “smart” central irrigation control system.
Student Housing has:
·         Installed low-water use fixtures (faucets, toilets, urinals, showerheads and washing machines)
·         Switched to cleaning equipment and procedures that reduce water use, and
·         Conducted communication and education campaigns with residents and staff regarding water efficiency.
Dining Services has adopted a wide variety of practices, including:
·         Instituted trayless dining (thus avoiding washing trays)
·         Installed low-flow and motion-sensor based pre-rinse nozzles, faucets and handwashing sinks in kitchens, re-circulating dishroom water troughs and a water-efficient warewashing system
·         Only performs water-bath thawing in emergencies
·         Uses cleaning equipment and procedures that reduce water use (such as micro-fiber mops, which use up to 80% less water than traditional mops)
·         Uses a linen service provider that is a member of the Laundry Environmental Stewardship Program®.
Additional Dining Services practices in the dining commons include:
·         Utilization of waste pulper in all three resident dining facilities that recycles waste water
·         Defrosting of meats in refrigerators rather than under running water
·         Avoiding use of running water to melt ice
·         Washing food in a partially filled sink as opposed to using running water
·         Using the correct size pots and pans for boiling water to avoid boiling more water than needed
·         Reporting and repairing leaks and dripping taps immediately
·         Turning off ice cream scoop wells when not in use, and
·         Installing air-cooled vs. open looped water cooled Ice makers.
Utilities has undertaken some key actions. Campus central plants accounts for roughly 14 percent of the total campus-wide domestic water use, and reductions in heating and cooling demands by the campus result in a proportional decrease in water use.
·         Installed a reverse osmosis system with the latest boiler expansion project. The higher quality water greatly reduced water use in supplying the boilers.
·         Many building projects implemented under the SEP and plant efficiency upgrades, like the condensing economizer, have decreased campus water use.",http://sustainability.ucdavis.edu/progress/water/index.html,"In early 2014, the state Department of Water Resources recognized that California was in a drought. California Governor Jerry Brown called on the state to reduce water use by 20%. UC Davis is responding to this call with a Drought Response Action Plan that outlines a set of actions that can be implemented to strive for a 20% reduction in water use from calendar year 2013, during the drought state of emergency. The actions cover operations, dining services, landscape management, research and agricultural water use, communication/behavior/education/outreach, utilities infrastructure, and new construction and renovations. Of note: While enrollment has nearly tripled since 1969, our campus is using the same amount of water as it did in the 1970s. That is because we have worked hard, often in response to previous droughts, to reduce water consumption throughout our operations.

Then, in April 2015, Governor Brown issued mandatory reductions, and the Davis campus had a 25% reduction to meet during the emergency drought regulation period of June 2015 - February 2016. The campus did in fact meet that with a 25.7% reduction in potable and landscaping water use. Because most of that period falls in a fiscal year (FY) that has not ended, this year's data report provides the prior FY data.

The campus has implemented water reuse projects with our tertiary-treated wastewater. During FY 2014-15, the Davis campus sent 212,879,000 gallons of recycled water through a waterway that functions as stormwater detention and habitat in order to keep the waterway clearer of algae and provide better habitat for pond turtles and other wildlife; and during the last month of FY 2014-15, the campus launched a water reuse project in cooling towers; during that short period, the towers used 2,963,900 gallons of reuse water in place of potable water, and through the summer and fall of FY 2015-16 when cooling needs were highest, it is projected to have saved 61 million gallons of potable water (data analysis is underway for actual water reuse).

UCI works collaboratively with the Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD), a pioneer in treating wastewater for reuse for agriculture and landscape irrigation. UC Irvine's blackwater is locally treated one-half mile away from campus at the IRWD Michelson Treatment Plant. Through IRWD the campus reclaims approximately 34% of blackwater produced on campus for landscape irrigation resulting in the conservation of more than 230 million gallons per year of potable water supply.



","Both potable and reclaimed water used on campus is metered, monitored, and analyzed by campus facilities staff and UCI's Water Resources Working Group as part of the tracking and monitoring of Water Action Plan implementation and progress.  Landscape irrigation is managed using a weather-based control system to match application rates to current evapotranspiration and rainfall data. 

","UCI has completed Phase 1 of an extensive campuswide plumbing retrofit program, replacing all pre-1994 plumbing fixtures (toilets and urinals) with high-efficiency fixtures. Phase 1 has resulted in annual savings of 14.8 million gallons per year.  The next phase of this program will involve replacement of targeted post-1994 fixtures (urinals with gpf greater than 1, toilets with 1.28-1.6 gpf, and faucets with gpm exceeding 0.5 gpm) which will result in an additional 10.6 million gallons per year in savings.","As part of the UC Sustainability Policy, UC Irvine focuses its procurement of appliances and equipment to be ENERGY STAR-rated or WaterSense certified.  ","A key goal of UC Irvine's campus landscape management plan, the 1995 Green and Gold Plan, is to ""develop a landscape that is sustainable and provides for long-term conservation of resources: energy, water, labor, and reduced production of green waste."" In support of this goal, the plan specifies the use of native and other environmentally suitable, low-water-use plant materials and irrigation-water-use efficiency.  This sustainable landscape program has guided campuswide landscape planning, design, implementation, and maintenance over the past 20 years.   

As an example, a recent demonstration project involved the conversion of a turf area in a high-visibility area (adjacent to the campus administration building) into a low-water-use California native woodland garden. The garden replaced a large area of water-intensive turf, reducing irrigation significantly and providing a demonstration project for the campus community.  Follow-up projects including a high-visibility location with a student housing community was implemented as a turf replacement native garden project in May 2015. This area was planted with native water-wise plants for demonstration and outreach to students, campus community, and visitors as a sustainable alternative to turf.",UC Irvine uses a central control system (Rainbird Maxicom) in conjunction with a weather station on campus. The central control system adjusts irrigation needs based on monitoring of evapotranspiration data and rainfall data.  ,"As part of the UC Irvine Water Action Plan opportunities for improved efficiency and conservation include the following:
1. Community engagement, education and outreach 
2. Plumbing fixture retrofit program Phase II
3. Improved leak notification and response
4. Condensate recovery and reuse in landscaping or fountains
5. Stormwater capture and reuse
6. Turf removal and native landscaping
7. Irrigation system improvements",http://www.sustainability.uci.edu/SustainableCampus/Water.html,"UC Irvine's water conservation initiatives have significantly reduced per capita water use on campus over the past decade.  Using the recently adopted UCI Water Action Plan as a roadmap, the campus is pursuing a range of initiatives including education, outreach, management practices, and projects to achieve an aggressive 30% additional water use reduction by year 2020.

For the rest of campus, metered buildings are random.","UCLA has installed 273 low flow urinals across campus, as well as many high efficiency water fixtures. New building projects are required to meet LEED Silver or higher water requirements and a specific number of water points. ",,"UCLA incorporates drought tolerant landscaping for all new projects on campus and is also strategically replacing ornamental turf with drought tolerant landscaping as funding becomes available. A recent installation near Murphy Hall replaced 45,500 square feet of turf grass saving more than 3 million gallons of water a year. A major turf replacement project on the intramural field employing artificial turf will save 6.4 million gallons a year. UCLA is being honored by LADWP (the utility) as the #1 in energy savings initiatives for 2015 and #3 in water. 

A team of undergraduate students in the Education for Sustainable Living Program, a course-credit program run through the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, designed and re-landscaped the area next to UCLA's gateway entrance at Hilgard Avenue and Wyton. The goal was to replace a portion of existing landscaping on campus with a more water-efficient one.  Students worked with staff in the Facilities Management Department and Housing & Hospitality Services, as well as students in UCLA's Extension program. The new landscaping features a range of low-water-using plants and a new drip irrigation system. Typically, such designs and plants result in using 30 to 50 percent less water over traditional landscapes, although higher efficiencies are possible.

We promote biodiversity and self sustaining systems. For example, Facilities supports several student projects from riparian planting, vernal pools and native planting at Krieger Child Care slope, Sunset Canyon Rec Area, the native and drought tolerant plants at the Wyton/Hilgard entrance and the on-campus housing landscape on south and south/west slopes area and planter beds. The new Court of Sciences Student Center features a native plant garden on the roof with different California plant communities such as Chaparral or Riparian. ","The campus utilizes weather data from the CIMIS station in Santa Monica to inform our irrigation in relation to temperature, cloud cover, humidity, wind, and precipitation.","So far, UCLA's water conservation efforts have reduced annual water use by over 70 million gallons since 2000. Our comprehensive approach to water conservation includes water recycling, high efficiency fixtures such as ultra-low flow urinals, drought tolerant landscaping, and smart climatologically-based irrigation and drip irrigation. New projects, such as a filtration system to treat water for re-use in our cogeneration plant, are under evaluation by the UCLA Water Taskforce, a group that includes staff and administration from Plumbing, Energy Services, Capital Programs, and the Medical Center, as well as faculty from the Engineering Department. UCLA’s Chief Sustainability Officer worked with the other nine campuses in the University of California system to develop a new section of the Sustainable Practices Policy focused on water conservation and efficiency. The new policy sets a target of 36%reduction in potable water use per capita from a 3 year campus baseline by 2025 with an interim target of 20% reduction by 2020.

The 1996-99 baseline was the earliest point in which UCSB had complete water consumption data. A three-year period was selected to provide a snapshot of water consumption, rather than one year's worth of data--a single year could have been a dry or wet year, thereby distorting policy regarding water consumption. ",--,--,"UCSB partnered with Goleta Sanitary District to build a recycled water facility, which is located at the Sanitary District, close to the campus. The facility produces recycled water, which we then use to irrigate 90% of the landscape on the campus. We also use recycled water in the toilets located in all the restrooms of the lab wing in Bren Hall.The University expanded the recycled water line along UCen Road. This expansion allows landscapes that were previously irrigated with potable water to now use recycled water.


","Utility & Energy Services gathers and stores energy and water use information for each campus facility for use in the development of conservation projects, verification of demand response performance, and utility billing of campus customers. The analysis required to support these functions relies on the ability to gather accurate, real-time utility usage and demand data, and the ongoing re-evaluation and improvement of the campus smart metering infrastructure is a high priority for the Utility & Energy Services team. 

UCSB’s Enterprise Energy Management(EEM) software suite is the data storage and analysis tool used to facilitate many of the campus’ energy management duties. EEM houses an extensive database that includes real-time and historical data on energy and water use, individual building system performance, campus-wide utility trending, and detailed weather information. A set of diagnostic and query applications allows users to perform detailed analyses of campus facilities across a range of variables.
","UCSB has made it a campus priority to update inefficient plumbing fixtures with high-efficiency fixtures, such as high-efficiency urinals, low-flow toilets, and new aerators on faucets. UCSB Facilities Management has received over $1,000,000 in grants and matched funding for retrofitting restrooms with efficient high-efficiency fixtures. 
Additionally the residence halls and dining commons have significantly improved their water conservation infrastructure in the past two years. Faucet aerators, high-efficiency shower heads (1.75 ga/minute) and dual-flush toilets (1.6/1.1 gallon per flush) have been installed in all of the residence halls. In the San Rafael residence hall, 100 new high efficiency toilets (1.28 gallons/flush) have been installed.
",UCSB conducted a campus-wide inventory of restroom fixtures to determine the restrooms with the least water efficient fixtures. UCSB is making it a priority to retrofit the least efficient water fixtures first.,"Architects are encouraged to utilize drought tolerant plants and native plants where appropriate. The stone swale adjacent to Girvetz Hall is lined with native and drought tolerant plants. In addition, more than 233 acres are protected and being restored to native plant communities, many which are drought tolerant.","UCSB's irrigation control system contains weather sensors that automatically adjust irrigation practices, based on weather conditions. We have two control stations, one for the main campus and a second for Housing & Residential Services. The campus-wide irrigation system is evapotranspiration-based and is controlled by the central control station. The central control station is operated through an on-campus weather station that measures local temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and dew point. The combination of the central control station and the weather station ensures that the University's irrigation schedule conserves water through proper irrigation techniques by avoiding watering after heavy rains and during inappropriate times of the day and by allotting specific amounts of water that meet the exact requirements of the vegetation. The irrigation system can also be manually adjusted by Facilities Management via a computer.
","To further water conservation efforts, UCSB has developed a Water Action Plan (WAP) and utilizes it as its primary guidance document for water conservation and efficiency programs and practices in both wet and dry years. The UCSB WAP highlights historical water conservation efforts, as well as providing recommendations for future efforts, which include over 20 management and infrastructure recommendations that are each complete with a full financial analyses. If all the recommendations were to be completed, UCSB would be able to cut their potable water use 15% by 2020. The UCSB WAP has been recognized as one of the most comprehensive water guidance documents for an institution of higher education and has received several awards.
To ensure sufficient maintenance and upkeep of campus water infrastructure, a Water Efficiency manager position has been created and filled within Facility Management. UCSB also adopted a voluntary water goal, which matches our local water district’s reduction requirement of 12% from Governor Jerry Brown’s most recent statewide 25% water reduction mandate.
As part of the campus’ overall strategy, residence halls host annual water saving competitions between the individual halls, granting prizes to the most water efficient residence hall.
Additionally a big part of our communications campaign focused on water conservation in the last few years. Our Chancellor’s Sustainability Committee (CSC) Subcommittee on Communications partnered with the Subcommittee on Water to create an outreach campaign regarding the current drought and UCSB’s efforts to conserve water. The campaign included DigiKnows, a movie trailer (played in local theaters), and signage placed all around campus regarding potable water reductions and recycled irrigation. We also collaborated with the Goleta Water district and hosted a Community Lecture Series, “Water We Going to Do?”, to raise awareness about the state of California’s water resources and water conservation and efficiency efforts.

General Planting Selection:
a. Planting areas outside building compounds should relate to the surrounding native
plant community and utilize native plants, closely related species, or, in specific and
limited locations, ornamentals successfully used on campus.
b. Planting areas within building compounds should respond to the uses and functions
of the buildings and spaces: providing sunny seating areas, shady resting areas,
colorful entries, and screening or buffers when necessary. Plant sizes should be chosen to assure long term adaptability to specific site locations.
c. Ground covers and vegetation shall be designed to minimize erosion.

3. Water Usage:
Selected plant species should be water efficient, requiring little or no irrigation, so as not to affect drainage and availability of water to existing native species, and to minimize water usage on campus.
4. Maintenance:
Plant materials should be selected for ease of maintenance so as not to require
substantial pruning, leaf and litter collection,or pest control. Avoid large deciduous trees
in interior courtyards that require substantial leaf collection.
5. Invasive plantings of non-native species should be avoided, to protect the natural floral diversity.
6. Fire Resistant Planting should be chosen in
areas of high fire hazard such as within the
chaparral plant community.
7. Deer Resistant Planting required
8. Lawn Areas:
a. Minimize lawn areas to conserve water usage on campus within a new building
complex. (General lawn areas are to be specified according to each particular
project program requirements.) When lawn areas are provided, provide a few larger
areas of lawn, as opposed to many smaller patches of lawn, in order to minimize
maintenance costs.
b. In layout of lawn areas and other specialized landscape areas, consider the ease of
lawn mower or other maintenance equipment access to such areas.

","UCSC Operates 26 of the major irrigation zones, including all recreational fields using centralized control with radio communication and RainMaster OASIS Advance Et. Rain Master's Advanced ET water management system provides the most sophisticated tool in the industry, tailored after the university accepted ""water budget"" method of irrigation. Advanced ET uses the latest scientific principles and methodologies, considering such factors: monthly plant crop coefficients, soil types, slope, precipitation, distribution uniformity, root zone depth, management allowable depletion, etc. to track the percentage of moisture maintained within the root zone on a per station basis. Central software automatically determines the proper frequency of application, run times, and water days, to insure that no runoff, deep percolation, or any form of water loss occurs. Equally important, the Rain Master system insures that your landscape obtains the right amount of water at the right time resulting in healthy robust plants.

Total accountability. In order for any system to be effective, the total water entering and leaving the root zone must be accurately measured. Accurate measurement of ET and rainfall is mandatory. Rain Master's weather center provides a direct method of measuring ET based upon one simple principle, evaporation. Because the central system utilizes water usage statistics obtained from the field satellite controller, precise accountability for all irrigation is possible. For example, if an automatic rain shutdown or wind shutdown should occur, lost irrigation will automatically be tracked and ""made up"" without any operator intervention. In a similar fashion, should any supplemental manual watering be performed, Advanced ET shall account for this by reducing the next scheduled irrigation cycle by the appropriate amount. 

The remaining 80 independent irrigation controllers are updated manually based on run times calculated by the same et loss method using average monthly et.","ET based scheduling as per above. New systems are designed for maximum irrigation distribution uniformity. Old systems are retrofitted for maximum irrigation distribution uniformity. Systems are maintained for optimum performance.

Water from the new water reclamation plant is used in the cogeneration facility processes that can be run with non-potable water. The water reclamation facility allows UConn to save up to 450,000 gallons of water a day. Rainwater collection is a feature of the new Oak Building. The water will be used for irrigating adjacent quads. There are two 25,000 gallons tanks that are designed to collect ground water and infiltrating rainwater from around the BMP and LID features near Oak Hall.

UConn also recently installed a rainwater and groundwater harvesting system at our new LEED-Gold certified Oak Hall academic building. This features two 25,000 gallon underground tanks which intercept groundwater and harvest roof runoff. In turn, this non-potable water is used for all irrigation of the surrounding landscaping as well as for the large lawn area and plantings throughout the nearby Student Union quad in the center of campus.
UConn continues to seek a permit that will enable us to use non-potable water from the new $25 million Reclaimed Water Facility at our wastewater treatment plant for irrigation of certain athletic fields and other landscaped areas on our main campus.
","The club sports fields located at the Depot Campus are equipped with soil moisture sensors to control the amount of irrigation used.  
For other Athletic fields, when UConn reaches drought conditions (as measured by real time instream flow gauges in the rivers near our water supply wellfields), Athletics is required to limit irrigation by time of day and volume (50%) until the drought restrictions are lifted.
","As the owner/operator of the public water supply system for the main campus and surrounding municipal, commercial and residential users, UConn has implemented supply system improvements and demand-side installations and retrofits.

Conservation and efficiency strategies include:

• UConn instituted an ongoing leak detection and repair program to find and fix broken water mains and distribution pipes 
• Improved controls and pumping schedules that prevent routine overflows and loss of water from our storage tanks and underground reservoirs
• Reclaimed water facility is used to treat and reuse effluent from UConn’s sewage plant
• Use real time measurements of stream flow in the river near UConn’s Fenton River and Willimantic River wellfields to decide when to curtail pumping so that aquatic habitats are protected
• If drought conditions persist, a Water Conservation Advisory is sent out to all UConn students, staff, and faculty—if necessary it is issued as mandatory and vehicle washing is prohibited
• UConn has installed low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators, along with low-flush urinals and dual-flush toilets
• Non-potable water collected in two 25,000 gallon tanks via the interception of groundwater and rainwater collection is used for landscaping
• UConn uses “xeriscaping,” or native, drought-tolerant plants, often planted in rain gardens and bioretention swales that collect runoff and roof drainage
• ResLife has installed hundreds of highly efficient front-loading washing machines in dorms and apartments
• Annual EcoMadness competition to promote water conservation within the dorms
• Trayless dining has resulted in a 20-25 percent reduction in water
• Several years ago, UConn retrofitted the irrigation system, and moisture retention capabilities of its new varsity field hockey turf, resulting in an 80% reduction in water used for irrigation of artificial turf before practices and games, as is required for safety and playability among NCAA Division 1 Field Hockey programs.

PPD Landscaping/Groundskeeping Superintendent Marty Werts said, ""We're very committed to reducing our water usage in landscape design at Grounds. I would estimate that 80% of the landscape projects we implement are xeriscaped, and more than half of those designs incorporate primarily native plants."" Native plants offer unique advantages, according to Werts. ""We can greatly reduce the labor time involved in caring for landscaped areas using natives,"" he explains. ""They're much more hardy because they're used to the climate and the soil - we don't have to amend the soil prior to planting. Also, they're very efficient when it comes to watering - most native plants can get by with just rainwater and don't have to be irrigated constantly.""

A computer controlled system then directs the water to a drip irrigation system to the plant beds nearby. The system eliminates the need to water all the planted beds during warm periods.

Knight Hall, home to the school of Journalism, is a green building surrounded by green space that now captures the rain that falls on the site in a 10,000 gallon cistern buried under the courtyard. This system collects rainwater from roof drains, channels the water through a high capacity filter in the courtyard, and stores it in an underground cistern.

To increase water conservation, the CHP has received a Class A Reclaimed Water Application to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to use reclaimed water at the CHP cooling towers as well, the first issued in Western Massachusetts. 

The Amherst campus currently uses about 330 million gallons of water per year. With the Class A Permit, the CHP would be able to use up to 200,000 gallons per day of reclaimed water, resulting in a potential reduction of potable water consumption of 21%.

History:  Approximately ten years ago the Town of Amherst Department of Public Utilities requested that UMass investigate ways to reuse the town’s Waste Water Treatment Plant’s effluent (reclaimed water) on campus.  UMass commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of reusing this effluent and confirmed that the reclaimed water was possible for boiler water make-up at the old power plant. The best path forward on this effort was to use proven technology – multi media filters, reverse osmosis membranes, and chlorination.

With approval from the Town of Amherst and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection the University started utilizing reclaimed water in 2005. The water re-use initiative reduced potable water consumption by about 16%.","All buildings over 20,000 square feet are metered here on campus.","The retrofit of campus toilets, urinals, and faucets targeted both academic buildings and residence halls.

The University protects areas of native plant communities from development, including the large USF Forest Preserve property north of the main campus.  

Campus development is carefully sited to minimize impacts to existing trees. The trees are protected from damage through the use of perimeter barricades placed at the tree drip lines or critical root zones. Limited existing trees that must be removed are replaced with new trees, which may be planted at the construction site or elsewhere on campus.

The data from each meter consists mainly of four variables; Current and Previous Month consumption (CM, PM) in gallons, and Current and Previous Day consumption (CD, PD) also in gallons. This data can also be trended for analysis purposes using the same IWS application where a user can also export it into excel. There is also an alarming feature in IWS where the technicians are constantly advise when a meter consumption is out of the historical norm. The meters send out electrical “pulses” per number of gallons of water, these pulses are counted in the plc (programmable logic controller) and totalized for consumption, then the server gathers this data and IWS is then utilized as described above. EBS, which is another client of the server, acts in a similar fashion as IWS, but only displays and stores Previous Month (PM) values for billing purposes.

-  Installed low flow shower heads and toilets in most housing facilities.

-   Installed water and energy conserving laundry equipment at some housing facilities

-  Captured cooling coil condensate at some air handling units to use for landscaping purposes

Water Recovery

- Installed underground water collection systems (cisterns).

- Capturing condensate from air handling units (air conditioning). Water captured from condensate is used to water grounds. UVA is currently working to expand this effort.

- Added a collection sump to collect water from condensation drains. In an effort to save approximately 1 million gallons of water annually, UVA has installed a collection sump in the Chemistry building that collects condensate from the air handlers which is then used as make up water in the central chilled water plant cooling towers.

 

Elimination of Water as a Cooling Source

- Conducted a comprehensive survey of our facilities.

- Identified air handling units (air conditioning) and water coolers that use domestic water as a source of cooling. UVa replaced those and prohibited their future use.

- Identified research and clinical equipment that used domestic water for cooling. UVa installed process chilled water service to those units. This is water that is 100% re-circulated.

 

Effective Measuring

- Added water meters to buildings on grounds. This helps us to target our efforts and identify specific problems to make sure water is used efficiently.

- Conducted an ultrasonic survey of the underground water distribution system. By surveying the water distribution system, E&U was able to identify and repair all leaks and update piping to ensure more efficient distribution of water.

- Revised UVa Building Design Guidelines to include low-flow fixtures and plumbing systems.

Drought resistant and native plants are used around campus to reduce the need for additional irrigation. Mulch made from composted landscape waste is placed around trees and in planter beds to help the vegetation keep moisture in during the summer heat.,"VU is in the process of installing a centralized irrigation system called the Rainbird IQ. Currently fourteen IQ controllers are installed: including installations at the recently built College Halls at Kissam and the newly renovated Alumni Hall, as well as other existing locations across campus. Additional controllers will be installed annually until all of campus is connected to the system.  The IQ will use a weather station that measures several different parameters such as rainfall, temperature, and historical ET (evapotranspiration). 

The IQ has settings that monitor these parameters and adjust irrigation. For example, heat and humidity levels are higher in July and August, so by measuring the ET, the systems will adjust by adding more time to each zone for watering to compensate for the evaporation rate. In the past, staff would adjust the controller up ten to fifteen minutes. The IQ will be very precise, giving the plants the minutes based on the weather that is happening in real time, thus saving Vanderbilt water and money. 

The IQ will also be equipped with a central rain gauge that we will default all controllers to off when a certain amount of rainfall is reached. The IQ is also equipped with a flow monitoring system which allows collects how much water is being used. The flow watch will also detect any breaks in the pipe that would prevent water from being wasted, by turning the system off and sending an alert.  The IQ has the potential to save Vanderbilt millions of gallons of water per year.

The biggest benefits in this system are the water saving capabilities and the reduction in person hours spent traveling to and from each controller. It also allows for better control of the water usage with the weather sensing technology. This system will allow for quicker leak repair since alerts will be received almost immediately, rather than days later when someone notices the running water down the sidewalk.
","Condensation recycling in MRB III, MRB IV, and The Commons Center takes water from the air and redirects it to the building’s cooling towers rather than sending it down the drain.

This was also a targeted priority even before the Office of Sustainability was established. ,--,--,The majority of irrigation on main campus utilizes water from Lake Waban and not from our potable supply. While irrigation does use water the water is being used in the same general area it is drawn from and the water not taken up by plants or lost through evaporation is returned to this system. The Nehoiden Golf Course is now irrigating with water drawn from a well installed on the golf course property in 2012. While this does not meet the criteria of the credit it is important to note.,"Per DEP regulations the college must track all water withdrawals from our wells and any other source such as Lake Waban. Many buildings are sub metered and all campus irrigation systems are metered. All irrigation systems have rain sensors and the larger systems are computer interfaced with a weather station by a sophisticated irrigation control system. We also have the ability to import from the town, which also closely meters the amount of water imported. ","All shower heads and faucets on campus are low-flow. All washing machines are high efficiency, both in terms of water use and electrical consumption. Dual flush toilets have been installed in the chapel and some dorms. ",Low flow shower heads and faucets have been installed in all resident halls and high efficiency washers have been installed throughout campus. ,"The majority of the campus is not irrigated, except in high use and/or formal areas: athletic fields, golf course, and quadrangles. The overall campus continues to be naturalized and incorporates plantings that are well suited to the college's environment, these areas are only watered during the establishment phase. All of West campus is irrigated from adjacent Lake Waban, a 110 acre lake water pond. ","All small systems have control systems that cease irrigation during periods of rain. Large systems are directly tied into a computer irrigation system monitored weather station, which also monitors humidity and other factors.","In order to reduce the amount of bottled water that is purchased for events, the Office of Sustainability built 3 water stations known as Wells on Wheels that connect directly to our own municipal water supply. This not only reduces waste from plastic bottles, but it also reduces excess water consumption and allows people to get just the right amount that they need. Furthermore, it reduces the transportation emissions that would otherwise be due to bottled water distributors. ",http://cs.wellesley.edu/~slee/sust/,--

As such, the campus maintains two Master water meters (east/west) so it can readily determine how much water is processed for campus use and how much is sent on to the village. There are also several campus building/field-level water meters in place that are hooked to the Village water delivery system, so that building usage is backed out of total billing the College sends to the Village. There are meetings at the Boathouse, the softball field, Dodge House, the Medical Center, and the Service Building. (Water for the service building is used almost exclusively as ""downflow"" to restart the College water system). ","For major renovations and new construction project, the College has had low-flow faucets and 1.5 gpm toilet installed.

","As above. For major renovations and new construction project, the College has had low-flow faucets and 1.5 gpm toilet installed. As older fixtures require upgrades, the College installs low-flow faucets, shower heads and low-flush toilets.
","Landscape beds and trees on campus are heavily mulched to conserve soil moisture. Both the volume of mulch around each planting has increased, as has the number of areas being mulched. ","Despite irrigation water being (currently) plentiful, the Facilities Grounds group employs practices to use only the amount of water that is needed. On a weekly basis, using a soil probe, Grounds staff monitor soil moisture to a 5"" depth to determine whether additional irrigation is needed or not. Rain gauges are in place near turf fields to determine the amount of actual precipitation received, and are monitored 5 days per week. Staff also conduct post-rainstorm sampling to determine whether adequate soil moisture levels have been achieved. 

In addition, the head of Facilities Grounds estimate that 90% of landscape plants selected are drought-tolerant.   ","The washers in all student laundry rooms are high-efficiency washers, significantly reducing water consumption per load. Under its contract with the MacGray Company for laundry service, the College utilizes their LaundryView system, which charts estimated water savings from the use of these high-efficiency machines.
