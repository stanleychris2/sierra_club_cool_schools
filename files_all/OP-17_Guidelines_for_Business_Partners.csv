1.	RECYCLING AND SOURCE REDUCTION:  It is the policy of this State to encourage and promote the purchase of products with recycled content to the extent economically practicable, and to purchase items which are reusable, refillable, repairable, more durable, and less toxic to the extent that the purchase or use is practicable and cost-effective.
We also encourage and promote using minimal packaging and the use of recycled/recyclable products in the packaging of commodities purchased.  However, no sacrifice in quality of packaging will be acceptable.  The company remains responsible for providing packaging that will protect the commodity and contain it for its intended use.
Companies are strongly urged to bring to the attention of purchasers those products or packaging they offer which have recycled content and that are recyclable.

2.	HISTORICALLY UNDERUTILIZED BUSINESSES: Pursuant to General Statute 143-48 and Executive Order #150, Appalachian State University invites and encourages participation in this procurement process by businesses owned by minorities, women, disabled, disabled business enterprises and non-profit work centers for the blind and severely disabled.

The requirements for the CMAR and each Subcontractor are:

A.	The Owner, the CMAR, and each Subcontractor shall include small businesses and disadvantaged business enterprises in the design, engineering and construction of the Project so long as this would result in services that are comparable in quality and would not result in a material increase in costs of the Project. A Disadvantaged business is a business that meets either the Arizona or Federal Small Business definition or is a Woman-Owned Business Enterprise [WBE] or is a Minority-Owned Business Enterprise [MBE], or is a Disadvantaged/Disabled-owned Business Enterprise [DBE].

B.	The CMAR and each Major and Minor Subcontractor must comply with all state and Federal laws; and employees need to be legal Arizona residents. The  CMAR and subcontractors will include in its monthly statement of certification affirmation that they are in compliance. The CMAR and each Major and Minor Subcontractor are required to use workers who are legal US and Arizona residents to do the Construction Work to the extent persons with the necessary and appropriate skills are reasonably available.

The requirements for the CMAR and each Major Subcontractor are:

“Major Subcontractor“ means the Subcontractors that, due to the nature of the construction work, comprise a critical or essential element of the construction such that the amount of the contract is equal to or greater than 10% or $200,000 of the construction budget, whichever is greater. Examples, include, but are not limited to such trades as steel, concrete, plumbing, HVAC, and electrical, excavation/site work, or any other subcontractor trade that is a major subcontractor due to the nature of the construction work in an particular Project.

C.	Health Insurance: The CMAR and each Major Subcontractor is required to provide health insurance for their respective full-time employees and to make health insurance coverage
 
available to dependents and to employees who are not full-time, but are assigned to the

Apprenticeship Requirements:

D.	The CMAR and each Major Subcontractor shall provide a ratio of not less than ten percent (10%) apprentices to journeymen in performing the Construction Work on the Project. The apprentices will be from State of Arizona registered apprenticeship programs.

E.	Apprenticeship: The CMAR and each Major Subcontractor are required to contribute an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the CMAR’s or Major Subcontractor’s gross payroll for Construction Work in the Project to fund training for Arizona residents in State of Arizona registered apprenticeship programs. The continuation of a prior practice of funding such apprenticeship programs will be counted against this requirement to the  extent  of  the continuing funding.

The amount in Item E will be included in the Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Project as a separate line item. The CMAR will indicate, on item #8 of the monthly certification page, the amount to be contributed to a registered apprenticeship program for that month. Owner will have the right to audit the CMAR’s and each Major Subcontractor’s payroll amounts. If Major Subcontractors do not have a designated registered apprenticeship program, the CMAR will impound the amount in Item E and will make payment to the State of Arizona registered apprenticeship program(s) selected by the CMAR and the Major Subcontractors.

Any failure by CMAR, or a Subcontractor to comply with the requirements in Section 6.1 or the applicable Final Plan will be a material breach of the CMAR Design Phase Services Contract Documents or the CMAR Construction Contract Documents, as applicable, and the Owner will have all rights and remedies upon occurrence of a material breach (including, without limitation, termination).





Anything in the CMAR Construction Contract Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, compliance in full by the CMAR and each Subcontractor with the CMAR’s Final Plan and the requirements in this Section 6.1 are conditions precedent of (A) each progress payment under the CMAR Construction Contract Documents, and (B) Final Completion and Final Payment under the CMAR Construction Contract Documents.

This Section 6.1 is one of provisions that the CMAR is obligated to include in its contracts with Subcontractors, respectively, and that Subcontractors at each level are required to
include in their contracts with Subcontractors of the next level.

In turn, these vendors have agreed to utilize local suppliers when possible to improve local sourcing opportunities. The Strategic Vendor Partners (SVP) hold major contracts with the University, and the individual schools and departments are required to order their goods and services from the SVP. These vendors provide goods and/or services such as:

Maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies
Office supplies
The Strategic Vendor Partners require a high capacity level from minority-, women-, and locally-owned (MWL) vendors, but they also provide mentoring and technical assistance to the MWL vendors with which they work.

Getting Started

Every vendor must be validated and approved before providing goods and services to the University. Once approved, vendors become part of our vendor database. The more data we have about our vendors, the easier it is for our purchasers to identify quality, reliable sources who have established a relationship with us.

This information is also vital because the University is a recipient of a substantial amount of federal funds, and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) require us to submit reports about the diversity of our vendor base. Our vendor information also helps further the University's commitment to offer opportunities to local and small minority-owned businesses to provide goods and services to the University.

Potential University vendors should only access the below questionnaire under the following conditions:

Vendor has been requested to complete the questionnaire by University customer
Vendor has been requested to complete the questionnaire by the Vendor Validation group
Vendor has been requested to complete the questionnaire by the University Purchasing Office
Vendor is seeking to qualify for Facilities and construction-related work
If vendor submits under any other premise, their questionnaire will not be reviewed. Additionally, completion of the questionnaire does not commit or guarantee use of the vendor by the University.

The University has a code of conduct for Manufacturing partners, which is also used for licensed vendors:

The Contractor hereby agrees that it will comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352) and the Executive Order 11246, dated September 24, 1965, and as amended by Executive Order 11375, is incorporated by reference Pub. L. 95-507 including flow-down clause requirements concerning small businesses is included by reference.

4.	Primary Contractors must submit a plan documenting their environmental stewardship efforts.
5.	Following Purchase Order/Agreement award, the Contractor is required to maintain records that identify both first and second tier efforts and submit quarterly progress reports.
","Duke University and Health System requires vendors to comply with Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, which are posted on our website and include basic, socially responsible terms.  Additionally, the following verbiage is included, in some variety, in the RFP language (this is dependent on the commodity being procured):

5.	Diversity and Environmental Programs
A.	Supplier Diversity (Minority/Women Business Enterprise Program)
Duke University voluntarily maintains a Minority/Women Business Enterprise Program (MWBE) as part of its effort to increase participation of women and minority vendors.  The goal is for a minimum of five percent (5%) of the university’s purchases to come from MWBE firms.  This is a goal, not a set-aside or quota.  We seek to achieve this goal through primary and second-tier suppliers (suppliers who contract with larger supply companies doing business with Duke).  All primary suppliers must submit a plan with their bid, indicating how they intend to use women and minority vendors as their second-tier suppliers.  Each plan will be evaluated based on good faith efforts and will consider the following factors:
o	Availability of women/minority vendors who can supply the goods and services requested in the Request for Bid.
o	Competitiveness of the prospective second-tier suppliers.
Where possible, vendors are encouraged to use second-tier suppliers in close proximity to Duke.  The use of local minority and women-owned businesses strengthens our commitment to the local economy.  In all cases, however, it is expected that the vendors meet the criteria of price, service and delivery.  Supplier diversity will be one, but not the sole, consideration in all contract awards.  Ultimately, it will be left to the discretion of the primary supplier as to which second-tier supplier it uses.  All minority/women vendors must be certified by one of several agencies:  municipal, state, federal, the National Minority Supplier Development Council or Duke.  When a contract is awarded, the supplier is required to maintain its second-tier effort and submit monthly reports on its progress.

B.	Environmental Program
Duke University strives to become a leader in environmental stewardship. Toward this purpose, Duke has initiated an Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) program. Our goals are to minimize waste, reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and model environmental protection practices within the Duke University and Duke Medicine. For details, see Duke’s EPP Guidelines at http://www.finance.duke.edu/procurement/green/epp.php.
With respect to product packaging, Duke seeks suppliers offering:
•	Packaging with post-consumer recycled content
•	Packaging that is locally recyclable
•	Minimized packaging
•	Packaging reclamation and reuse programs 
With respect to laboratory supplies, Duke seeks suppliers offering:
•	Product reclamation and recycling programs
•	Calibration services that will extend product life
•	Reusable alternatives to commonly discarded products
•	Alternatives to mercury and natural latex
•	Personnel that will seek-out, identify and promote environmentally friendly products through their purchasing system, within the storerooms and throughout the labs
•	The ability to provide quarterly spend reports with regards to green product purchases
•	Active participation in Duke’s EPP program, including dissemination of information and collection of recyclable and reusable lab materials upon delivery
•	An in-house staff that follows the fundamental beliefs stated in Duke’s Environmental Statement, which can be viewed at: http://www.duke.edu/sustainability/documents/Duke Env Policy statement.pdf
Duke gives preference to suppliers with a commitment to cost, quality, and environmental excellence. Bidders are encouraged to include concise information on reduced impact products and services. Include relevant certifications of materials sources and manufacturing processes.
There is also an Energy Star mandate for appliances, a Computer standardization program / ePeat, and an Office Supply vendor partnership for greater environmental products. exposure",http://finance.duke.edu/procurement/vendors/po.php,--

Georgia Pacific, Emory provider of industrial paper hand towels & bath tissue, was under contract with our Healthcare organization at favorable prices when compared to a green seal certified product being supplied to us by Bay West. In order to create a possible savings opportunity Emory University, our office needed to 1) require Georgia Pacific to obtain certification for its line of post consumer waste content paper and 2) entice them to redesign the exterior packaging used for its product line to promote and extol sustainable practices. We approached the executive management of the company and after much work achieved the following:

1. GP secured Ecologo certification for all of the material being offered to Emory.

2. GP developed in conjunction with our office a redesign of their entire post consumer national product line packaging. The new verbiage on their packaging now says “green by design and desire”, and the packaging used confirms the post consumer content of the material and the manufacturing practices.",https://www.finance.emory.edu/home/Procure%20and%20Pay/for_suppliers/index.html,Data reported for 2013-2014 fiscal year.

Updated November 2013

Oberlin College will only knowingly purchase from apparel companies whose workers and whose suppliers’ workers (meaning those of all contractors and subcontractors) are present at work voluntarily, not at undue risk of physical harm, fairly compensated and not exploited in any way. Please checkmark the items with which your company complies, and use the space below each item to explain your company’s policy if it is not in compliance with Oberlin College’s Code. Noncompliance with one or more items does not necessarily mean Oberlin College will withhold business from your company.

_____	There shall not be any use of forced labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise.


_____ 	No person shall be employed at an age younger than 15 (or 14 where the law of the country of manufacture allows) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education in the country of manufacture where such age is higher than 15.  Companies and suppliers should work with governmental, human rights and non-governmental organizations to minimize the negative impact on any child released from employment as a result of the enforcement of this Code.


_____	Companies shall ensure that suppliers construct and maintain a safe and healthy working environment which will prevent accidents and injury to health. 


_____  Employees shall receive compensation for any injuries, illnesses, or diseases which may arise in an employee as a result of her or his working for for a supplier of the company.  Employers must ensure that workers are paid all compensation and benefits due to workers under local law in the case of dismissal, layoff, plant closure and other instances of termination of employment or suspension of work, regardless of whether the payment is made by the affected workers’ direct employer or the apparel company.

To ensure compliance with this standard, at the time of contracting for products from a given supplier factory and on a quarterly basis thereafter during the duration of the contract, the company must require proof that the supplier factory and/or its owners have set aside and/or contributed sufficient funds to fulfill these obligations, in a manner that guarantees the availability of these funds to workers at the time when they are due.

The company must not enter into a contract for products from a given supplier factory when they know or reasonably should know that the factory and/or its owners have significant outstanding obligations to current or former employees as a result of prior dismissals, layoffs, plant closure or other instances of termination or suspension of work, unless the contract requires the supplier to satisfy its obligations to these employees as a condition of receiving payments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a supplier factory does not fulfill its obligations to current and/or former employees from dismissal, layoff, plant closure or other instances of termination of employment or suspension of work within thirty (30) days of effective date of the obligation, the apparel company will pay, according to principles of joint and several liability, the entire outstanding obligation within thirty (30) days.

The apparel companies shall be jointly and severally responsible for all legally mandated compensation, including but not limited to severance pay, accrued vacation and holiday pay, and unpaid wages owed to workers employed at factories that have produced apparel, even if the company is not the direct employer of the workers.


_____  The company and all its suppliers shall recognize and respect the right of employees to freedom of association/unionization.  If employees engage in the process of unionization, employers shall not retaliate against any employees in any relevant manner.  No threats shall be made, there shall be no indication to any employee that she or he will be punished if she or he expresses approval of the union, and/or decides to join the union.  Once a union has been formed, employers at all levels shall negotiate in good faith with the union and its representatives. Members of factory management shall not hold office in factory level unions.


_____ Companies shall require their suppliers to respect the right of a worker to refuse work that he or she has reasonable justification to believe is unsafe, without suffering discrimination or loss of pay, including the right to refuse to enter or to remain inside a building that he or she has reasonable justification to believe is unsafe for occupation.


_____ Companies shall ensure supplier factories maintain a legitimate worker complaint process and mechanism that ensures that workers can raise in a timely fashion concerns about health and safety risks, safely and confidentially.


_____ 	Employers at supplier factories must provide wages and benefits which comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and which match or exceed the local prevailing wages and benefits in the relevant industry.


_____  Employees shall not be required to work more than the lesser of (I) 48 hours per      week or (II) the limits on regular hours allowed by the law of the country of manufacture.


_____  Overtime shall not exceed 12 hours per week.


_____	Overtime shall not be, in any manner, required of any employee.


_____  Employees shall be entitled to at least one day off in every seven-day period. 


_____	Payment for overtime work shall be at a rate of 1.5 times the normal salary, or such premium rate as is legally required in the country of manufacture, whichever is higher.

_____  Homework (work not done at the place of manufacture) shall not be required of or pressured upon any employee. Any instances of voluntary homework must be done in a manner safe for the employee and any persons who may be in the surrounding vicinity.

_____  The use of temporary workers should not be a permanent practice of any company or supplier.  Rather, they should be used in response to unforeseen events, or yearly events – such as an increase in demanded production around the winter holidays – which last for a short period.  Temporary workers are not to be used as a weapon against the employees in the case of a union struggle.  They are not to be used to escape from paying benefits to its part or full-time employees.

_____  In the case of a natural disaster or other crisis that causes the disruption of production, the company and suppliers shall make every effort to resume production at the affected worksite(s) to prior levels as soon as feasible and not to move production elsewhere, as doing so would further intensify the effects of the disaster/crisis on the workers and their community.
_____  Companies that own or purchase from factories operating in Bangladesh must be party to the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.
_____  In countries where law or practice offers fewer or weaker protections than these labor standards, the above mentioned standards should apply to corporate practice.  Firms should refrain from any actions that would diminish the protections of these labor standards.  

_____	A list of all supplier factories, including contractors and subcontractors, and their addresses and contact information is attached to this checklist.

_____  If your company has any program of third-party independent monitoring of supplier factories, please name the monitoring group and describe the program below. If possible, include a copy of a recent inspection report.

","The Purchasing Department works with the Sweatshop Committee to oversee the Anti-Sweatshop Purchasing Policy. The policy, which was heralded by AFL-CIO president John Sweeney as ""probably the strongest anti-sweatshop agreement of any college or university in the United States"" in 1999, has since been expanded beyond apparel. Over the years, Oberlin has ceased purchasing from several manufacturers determined to be in violation of the policy. For example, Oberlin College banned Coca-Cola products over concerns about the company's environmental and human rights record from 2007-2013. ",http://oberlin.edu/purchase/purchasing,--

The Sustainability Policy applies to any individual or organization making decisions for Sheridan College, including “Board members, employees and others including volunteers, consultants and contractors engaged by Sheridan to provide services.” The policy is based four science-based sustainability principles of The Natural Step:

“Principle 1: We must eliminate our contributions to the systematic increase of concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth’s crust (e.g. heavy metals and fossil fuels).
This means substituting our use of certain minerals that are scarce in nature with others that are more abundant, using all mined materials efficiently, and systematically reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.

Principle 2: We must eliminate our contributions to the systematic increase of concentrations of substances produced by society (e.g. plastics, dioxins, PCBs, DDT and neonicotinoids).
This means substituting certain persistent and unnatural compounds with ones that are normally abundant or break down more easily in nature, and using all substances produced by society efficiently.

Principle 3: We must eliminate our contributions to the systematic physical degradation of nature and natural processes (e.g. over harvesting forests, destroying habitat and overfishing).
This means drawing resources only from well-managed eco-systems, systematically pursuing the most productive and efficient use of resources and land, and exercising caution in all kinds of modifications of nature, such as overharvesting and the introduction of invasive or non-native species.

Principle 4: We must eliminate our contributions to conditions that systematically undermine people’s capacity to meet their basic human needs. 
This means offering products and services and changing practices, suppliers, and business models to those who demonstrate, through their policies and practices, that human rights are respected, income-making barriers are removed, safe and healthy work environments are provided, and living conditions allow local communities to meet the needs of citizens.”

The Sustainability Procedures further define sustainable practices as they pertain to the Sustainability Policy:

Overall Sustainability
The following is a list of general guidelines, measures and provisions pertaining broadly to sustainable practice, which a decision maker may consult for reference.
1.	Sheridan will seek to consistently act in ways that preserve and enhance natural and social capital to allow future generations to enjoy a quality of life that is equal to or greater than our own.
2.	Sheridan will develop and model a culture of sustainability that instils a global societal perspective, and truly reflects how the Sheridan community’s everyday interactions affect sustainability on campus and beyond.
3.	Sheridan will take every opportunity to minimize adverse environmental and social impacts of its facilities operations. All campus operations, including procurement and food services, should seek ways to mitigate and improve the environmental impacts associated with delivery of services.
4.	Any new RFP solicited should include ways that vendors will seek to mitigate and improve the environmental impacts associated with the delivery of services.
5.	Sheridan will embrace transparency and accountability, as cornerstones of driving its sustainable transformation, by publically sharing its sustainability metrics and institutional sustainability performance. This includes, wherever possible, establishing infrastructure for monitoring, processing and measuring resource consumption and pricing at the building level, and allowing access to this information.
6.	Sheridan will develop and publish its Sustainability Plan by January 1, 2016. The Plan will be built through broad stakeholder engagement, and will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. The Plan will be published on the Office for Sustainability Intranet, accessible to employees through Access Sheridan.
7.	Sheridan will file an Annual Sustainability Report describing its progress on goals set forth in the Sustainability Plan.
8.	Sheridan will leverage its position as a leader in creative programming to address sustainability challenges with innovations in energy and water use, waste reduction, air quality improvement, and product procurement that will meet and potentially exceed our mandatory compliance commitments. Research at Sheridan can contribute creative solutions that diminish, neutralize and counteract adverse environmental impacts. Where possible, lessons learned will be applied and freely shared.
9.	Sheridan will strive to help students, through their experiences at Sheridan, achieve environmental awareness and exposure to leading-edge sustainable practice within the context of current and emerging world issues. Sheridan seeks to help students become conscientious stewards of the planet.
10.	Sheridan strives to prepare the next generation of global citizens to address the difficult challenges of global climate change, environmental degradation, social justice, and social equity. 

The RFP template also addresses the four sustainability principles of the Natural Step as well as Sheridan College’s Mission Zero goals. In addition, it outlines the Final Agreement requirements business partners must adhere to. The requirements include:

5.2 Any Contract resulting from this Request for Proposal will be governed by and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario.

I. Introduction
Smith College is committed to conducting its business affairs in a socially responsible manner consistent with its educational mission and commitment to diversity. To this end, we establish this Code of Conduct as a working document to guide vendor and institutional purchasers of apparel. We recognize this Code as a work in progress and anticipate that it will be revised through our active participation in the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) and the Fair Labor Association (FLA).

Smith College recognizes eight cardinal principles as the basis for effective performance under this Code of Conduct:

Full Public Disclosure of Factory Addresses.
Commitment to fair wages.
Independent Monitoring.
Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining.
Safe Working Conditions.
No Forced Labor.
No Child Labor.
Women's Rights.
Smith College expects affiliated vendors and institutional purchasers to conduct their business in a manner consistent with these principles, and to follow workplace standards that adhere to this Code of Conduct.

II. Notice
This Code shall apply to all vendors and institutional purchasers of Smith College. Throughout this Code, the term ""vendor"" shall include all persons or entities who have entered a written Retailing Agreement with Smith College to sell products bearing the name, trademarks and/or images of Smith College. Institutional purchasers are all Smith departments, offices, and authorized organizations (including student organizations) who, through the course of their regular business, purchase apparel. Additionally, this Code shall apply to all of the vendor's and institutional purchasers' contractors. Throughout this Code, the term ""contractor"" shall include each contractor, subcontractor, vendor, or manufacturer that is engaged in a manufacturing process that results in a finished product for the consumer. ""Manufacturing process"" shall include assembly, packaging, shipping and receiving.

As a condition of being permitted to produce, sell, and/or distribute products on campus bearing the name, trademarks and/or images of Smith College, each of the above parties must comply with this Code and monitor and report that its contractors comply with this Code. All parties and their contractors are required to adhere to this Code within six (6) months of notification of the Code and as required in applicable license agreements, or to have submitted to the college and received written approval on a reasonable compliance plan that establishes a firm deadline for full compliance. Compliance plans must be submitted to the college within three (3) months of notification.

Full compliance with this Code is a goal to be worked toward by all parties in good faith. As a matter of practical necessity, the college recognizes the complexities of the request and the need to allow vendors sufficient time and flexibility to implement compliance plans, which may require still further negotiation and changes in contractual obligations by the vendor with subcontractors, suppliers, and other parties. The college is committed to granting such flexibility so long as vendors are making reasonable progress toward substantial compliance by a firm approved deadline. All specific arrangements will be authorized by the purchasing manager, who, in turn, will consult with an advisory committee. Plans must contain specific benchmarks and dates for review of satisfactory progress.

III. Remediation
Remedies herein apply to violations which occur after the Effective Date of the Code. Smith College may rely upon monitors to report such violations. If a vendor has failed to correct a violation of the Code, Smith College or an authorized organization will consult with the vendor (for itself and on behalf of its contractors, subcontractors or manufacturers) to determine appropriate corrective action. The remedy will, at a minimum, include paying all applicable back wages found due to workers who manufactured the contracted articles, and requiring the vendor to take all steps necessary to correct such violations including reinstatement of any worker found to have been unlawfully dismissed. If agreement on corrective action is not reached, and/or the action does not result in correction of the violation within a specified reasonable time period, Smith College reserves the right to (a) require that the vendor or institutional purchaser terminate its relationship with any contractor, subcontractor or manufacturer that continues to conduct its business in violation of the Code and/or (b) terminate its relationship with any vendor that continues to conduct its business in violation of the Code. In either event, Smith College will provide the vendor with thirty (30) days written notice of termination. In order to ensure the reasonable and consistent application of this provision, Smith College will seek advice from the WRC and the FLA regarding possible corrective measures and invocation of options (a) and (b) above.

IV. Standards
Smith College vendors must operate workplaces, and ensure that their contractors operate workplaces, that adhere to the following minimum standards and practices. Smith College prefers that these

A. Legal Compliance: Smith College vendors and institutional purchasers must comply, at a minimum, with all applicable legal requirements of the country in which products are manufactured. Where this code and the applicable laws of the country of manufacture conflict or differ, the higher standards shall prevail. Such compliance shall include compliance with all applicable environmental laws.

B. Environmental Compliance: Vendors and institutional purchasers will be committed to the protection and preservation of the global environment and the world's finite resources, and conduct business accordingly.

C. Ethical Principles: Vendors and institutional purchasers will commit to conduct their business according to a set of ethical standards which include, but are not limited to, honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and respect for the unique intrinsic value of each human being.

D. Employment Standards: Smith College will only do business with vendors whose workers are present at work voluntarily, are not at undue risk of physical harm, are fairly compensated, and are not exploited in any way. In addition, the following specific guidelines must be followed:

1.Wages and Benefits: Vendors and their contractors recognize that wages are essential to meeting employees' basic needs. Vendors and their contractors shall pay employees, as a floor, wages and benefits which comply with all applicable laws and regulations. [Note: Smith is committed to participating in efforts by nonprofit organizations to establish a metric for a livable wage in all countries, and the College may add such a provision to this Code. The College will inform all vendors and institutional purchasers when Smith adopts or changes a particular living wage scale.] The College recognizes the need for workers to have safeguards against arbitrary, excessive, and capricious fines and penalty systems used to undermine wage scales. It is committed to work with all parties to guard against such practices.

2. Regular Working Hours: Employees shall not be required to work more than the lesser of 48 hours per week (the International Labor Organization [ILO] standard) or the limits on regular hours allowed by the law of the country of manufacture. Employees will be entitled to at least one day off in every 7-day period, as well as holidays and vacations.

3. Overtime: Overtime hours must be worked voluntarily, except as necessary to meet basic health and safety needs, and in the latter case never on a regular basis. In addition to their compensation for regular hours of work, employees shall be compensated for overtime hours at the greater of either (a) one and one-half times the regular rate of pay during the workweek and twice the regular rate of pay on holidays and the seventh consecutive day of work, or (b) as is legally required in the country of the manufacturer, whichever is higher.

4. Child Labor: As a general guideline, vendors shall not employ any person at an age younger than is consistent with International Labor Organization practices for developing countries. Vendors agree to consult with governmental, human rights and non-governmental organizations, and take reasonable steps as evaluated by Smith College or its authorized monitors to minimize the negative impact on children released from this employment as a result of the implementation of this Code. Through these consultations, the Vendor will insure that any exceptions to ILO standards do not violate children's rights to mandatory or basic education as defined by the ILO or the laws of the country in question.

5. Forced Labor: There shall not be any use of forced labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, or otherwise.

6. Health and Safety: Contractors shall provide a safe and healthy work environment to prevent accidents and injury to health arising out of, linked with, or occurring in the course of work or as a result of the operation of Contractor facilities. Smith College will continue to work with its organizational partners in developing uniform standards for monitoring and assessment of such conditions to comply with all health and safety conventions of the ILO. As a first step, Smith will request any monitors to report on compliance with the following health and safety standards as set by local and national laws:

Manufacturing Equipment and Safety: All hazardous equipment must be properly maintained, with a maintenance log to monitor compliance, and have all required safety devices. All workers must at minimum receive all legally mandated personal protection equipment to operate equipment, as well as all required training and licensing.
Working Environment: All workplaces should meet minimum standards for ventilation, room temperature, air quality, lighting, and decibel levels, and workers should be provided with basic personal protective equipment (such as dust masks and ear plugs).
Hazardous Chemicals: All workplaces should have proper labeling and worker education with regard to all hazardous materials used in the plant, proper storage of all hazardous materials, and emergency-preparedness plans, emergency first-aid supplies, and a comprehensive safety log.
Fire Plans: All workplaces should have clearly marked and accessible emergency exits and clear, marked paths to them, emergency or fire alarms and lighting, maintained fire extinguishers throughout the work site as required by law, and emergency response plans in the event of a fire which are practiced by workers at regular intervals
Hygiene: All workplaces, canteen and cafeterias, and toilet facilities must meet minimum health standards and be in good working order. Toilet facilities should be in ratio to the work force to be easily accessible, well stocked with all necessary supplies, and be free of monitoring.
7. Nondiscrimination: Vendors shall employ individuals solely on the basis of their ability to perform the job. There shall be no discrimination in hiring, salary, benefits, performance evaluation, discipline, promotion, retirement or dismissal on the basis of age, sex, pregnancy, maternity leave status, marital status, race, nationality, country of origin, social or ethnic origin, disability, sexual orientation, religion, or political opinion. Workers who take maternity leave will not face dismissal, nor threat of dismissal, loss of seniority or deduction of wages, and will be able to return to their former employment at the same rate of pay and benefits.

8. Harassment or Abuse: Every employee shall be treated with dignity and respect. No employee shall be subject to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse. No employee or prospective employee shall be subjected to involuntary use of contraceptives or pregnancy testing. Vendors will not use or tolerate any form of corporal punishment.

9. Women's Rights: Because the overwhelming majority of apparel workers are women, assuring and safeguarding women's rights is of particular importance for all parties. In addition to not discriminating
on the basis of sex, pregnancy, marital status, or sexual orientation, the following specific guidelines must be followed:

Women workers will receive equal remuneration, including benefits, equal treatment, equal evaluation of the quality of their work, and equal opportunity to fill all positions as male workers.
Pregnancy tests will not be a condition of employment, nor will they be demanded of employees.
Workers who take maternity leave will not face dismissal nor
threat of dismissal, loss of seniority or deduction of wages, and will be able to return to their former employment at the same rate of pay and benefits.
Contractors shall provide appropriate services and accommodations to women workers in connection with pregnancy.
Workers will not be exposed to hazardous or toxic chemicals that may endanger their safety, including their reproductive health, without safeguards and proper instruction in their use.
Workers will not be forced or pressured to use contraception.
10. Freedom of Association: Vendors shall recognize and respect the right of employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining. No employee shall be subject to harassment, intimidation or retaliation in their efforts to freely associate or bargain collectively. Vendors shall not cooperate with governmental agencies and other organizations that use the power of the State to prevent workers from organizing a union of their choice. Vendors shall allow union organizers free access to employees in and around the workplace when they are not engaged in their work as defined by national regulations and ILO standards. Vendors shall recognize the union of the employees' choice. *

11. Labor Standards Environment: In countries where law or practice conflicts with these labor standards, vendors agree to work with governmental, human rights, labor business organizations, and the FLA and WRC and their authorized monitors to achieve full compliance with these standards. Vendors further agree to refrain from any actions that would diminish the protections of these labor standards. In addition to all other rights under the Agreement, Smith College reserves the right to refuse renewal of Agreements for goods made in countries where: (a) progress toward implementation of the employment standards in the Code is no longer being made; and (b) compliance with the employment standards in the Code is deemed impossible. Smith College shall make such determination based upon examination of reports from governmental, human rights, labor and business organizations and after consultation with the relevant vendor.

V. Implementation
Smith College seeks to foster an environment of labor
standards compliance through ensuring adherence to the standards established by this Code. Working in conjunction with the WRC and the FLA, the College will seek to create a process of implementation based on the following guidelines:

A. Transparency: Vendors will provide the company names, owners and/or officers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and nature of the business association, including the jobs performed in the manufacturing process, of all of the contractors and manufacturing plants which are involved in the manufacturing process of vended and purchased articles.

B. Written Agreement of Compliance: Vendors will provide written confirmation that they agree to adhere to the code and be subject to independent monitoring.

C. Notification and Education of Employees: All vendors and their contractors shall inform employees of all provisions of the Code in language they can understand.

D. Timely Response to Queries and Monitoring: Vendors will provide timely written responses to all audits, monitoring reports, and independent queries from the College or its authorized monitors.

E. Pricing: The vendors and institutional purchasers must assure that they are paying their contractors a sufficient price to meet production costs while complying with this Code and to make a reasonable profit.

VI. Disclosure
Information provided by the vendor, through the process described in Section V (Implementation), shall be considered public information. The vendor shall be required to immediately report to Smith College any changes in its business operations which materially affect the application of this Code, such as the selection of a new factory.

VII. Verification and Compliance Mechanism
It shall be the responsibility of each vendor and institutional purchaser to ensure its compliance with this Code, and to verify that its contractors are in compliance with this Code. Clearly defined methods of monitoring, training, receipt and processing of employee complaints, adjudication of disputes, and enforcement have not been determined by Smith College. Smith College and the WRC and the FLA shall undertake efforts to determine and clearly define the obligations associated with the development of adequate training, monitoring, investigation, receipt and processing of employee complaints, adjudication of disputes, and mechanisms for enforcement of this Code, including establishment of a reasonable time frame within which compliance measures will begin.

A. Public Accountability

Smith College shall establish an advisory procedure to include students, faculty, and staff in the development, oversight and verification of this Code.
Smith College shall also establish a procedure for public accountability to any interested party for its progress in realizing the goals set forth in this Code.
B. Funding

The College shall insure that the Purchasing Manager has the resources necessary for the implementation of this Code.

Adopted by the Smith College Board of Trustees 10/27/2001; amended 5/17/2002.

SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Seller agrees to use good faith efforts to be environmentally responsible and reduce waste removal costs through:
• Minimizing packaging and using packaging materials that can be recycled
• Offering products that produce less waste than previously-offered products
• Implementing efficient logistics and marketing efforts
• Promoting recycling and reuse programs

LIVING WAGE 
Stanford already pays a living wage to its employees and now adopts this living wage and benefit policy to guide its procurement of such services from contractors. Through these guidelines, Stanford seeks to establish minimum pay, access to healthcare benefits and compensated time off for service workers. These guidelines are not intended to prevent contractors from providing wages and benefits in excess of the minimums created here.

When a construction / renovation project is initiated, the campus starts  by requesting a prevailing wage schedule from the DOL website, at the website the campus received a Public Works ID number for the project.  This alerts DOL and the public that a public works job is being performed on our campus.  All contractors who bid on the job receive a copy of the DOL wage schedule.  Once a contractor is hired, certified payrolls are required with all payment requests (from the prime contractor as well as any subcontractors).  We review the certified payrolls to make sure they are in alignment with the DOL wage schedule.  DOL and/or union business agents also audit the jobs and certified payrolls often to confirm compliance.  At the end of a project, as a part of our closeout process, a Release is required from the contractor and subcontractor certifying that all monies on the project have been paid according to DOL prevailing wage schedule.  By establishing the Prevailing Wage, it establishes a minimum standard by which wage rates and living wages are established for work by contractors on the campus.

ii. A state agency shall not be required to purchase recyclable or re-manufactured commodities at a cost premium unless such commodity also constitutes a ""recycled commodity"" as defined in this subdivision and that as such a recycled commodity, it has been offered for sale in conformance with the standards for application of a cost premium for recycled commodities as set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (I) of this paragraph.

Tulane is committed to conducting its business in a socially responsible manner.   Tulane expects the same of its long-term vendors whose employees have a material presence on campus.  To facilitate this goal, Tulane has created this Vendor Labor Code of Conduct as a means of ensuring that such vendors share the same commitment to fair labor practices as does Tulane.    

Application
This Vendor Code of Conduct applies to all vendors described above whom the University enters into long-term contracts to provide services on any of its campuses and whose employees have a material presence on campus.  For purposes of this Code of Conduct, “long-term contract” shall mean contracts of five years or longer.   To determine the length of the contract, the initial term and any renewal periods will be aggregated.  For purposes of this Code of Conduct, “material presence on campus” shall mean that the contract requires the vendor to employ at least 15 employees on a full-time, regular basis and that those employees will actively work on campus throughout the term of the proposed contract.  

Information to be Provided During the Negotiation Process
When the University considers a vendor who will be subject to this policy, the vendor will be required to provide documentation to the University that demonstrates the vendor has and communicates to its employees the following:  
•	An  employee grievance and discipline procedure;
•	An outline of the vendors’ expectations on the topics mentioned in the Tulane Staff Handbook section on “Standards of Conduct”;
•	Detailed wage structures, including descriptions of how employees advance within the company;
•	Detailed employee benefits information which includes a description of the benefits and the requirements that must be met for employee eligibility for these benefits.

In addition, during the course of contract negotiations, vendors must submit to the University the vendor’s wage structure as to enable the University to assess whether the wages proposed are consistent with its standards of fairness and equitable treatment.  All information provided by vendors as part of this process will be considered by Tulane and serve as one factor in Tulane’s decision about which vendor to select for the provision of services.

Mandatory Contractual Provisions
Tulane will insist on the following non-negotiable contract term:
•	“Contractor shall comply, and shall ensure that its agents, officers, directors, employees, representatives, servants and vendors materially comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances in its performance pursuant to this Agreement.  In particular and without limitation, Contractor will materially comply with all federal, state and local laws regarding equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and with Tulane’s Non-Discrimination and Harassment Policy.”

WHEREAS, UC has implemented a Fair Wage/Fair Work initiative that requires certain Suppliers to pay their employees the UC Fair Wage (defined as $13 per hour as of 10/1/15, $14 per hour as of 10/1/16, and $15 per hour as of 10/1/17); 

WHEREAS, the Agreement contemplates that Supplier will furnish UC with temporary or supplementary staff; 

WHEREAS, the Agreement does not obligate UC to obtain Services from Supplier; and 

WHEREAS, UC has determined that the only way to ensure compliance with the PPACA and Fair Wage/Fair Work initiative is to obtain certain representations from its suppliers of temporary or supplementary services.

WHEREAS, the Agreement contemplates that Supplier will furnish UC with temporary or supplementary staff; 

WHEREAS, the Agreement does not obligate UC to obtain Services from Supplier; and 

WHEREAS, UC has determined that the only way to ensure PPACA compliance is to obtain certain representations from its suppliers of temporary or supplementary services.

Revise the Warranties Article to read in full as follows:

In addition to the warranties set forth in other Articles of the Agreement, Supplier makes the following warranties.  Supplier acknowledges that failure to comply with any of the warranties in the Agreement will constitute a material breach of the Agreement and UC will have the right to terminate the Agreement without damage, penalty, cost or further obligation.
A.	General Warranties.  Supplier agrees that the Services furnished under the Agreement will be covered by the most favorable warranties Supplier gives to any customer for the same or substantially similar services, or such other more favorable warranties as specified in the Agreement.

1.	Supplier offers health coverage to its full-time employees who are performing Services for UC;
2.	Supplier’s cost of enrolling such employees in Supplier’s health plan is factored into the fees for the Services; and
3.	The fees for the Services are higher than what the Services would cost if Supplier did not offer health coverage to such full-time employees.
B.  If Supplier is not an Applicable Large Employer (as defined above):
1.  Supplier offers group health coverage to its full-time employees who are performing Services for UC and such coverage is considered Minimum Essential Coverage (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1-5000A-2) and is Affordable (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980H-5(e)); or

Sustainable Development is enhanced through sound Environmental, Social and Economic practices and technologies that minimize or eliminate waste and negative impacts on current resources.

UofL seeks products and services that pose no significant risk to human health or environmental quality when compared with competing products or services that serve the same purpose. This comparison, where applicable, may consider raw materials and energy acquisition; production and manufacturing; packaging and distribution; and the operation, maintenance, reuse, recyclability or disposal of a product.

The university also has an Environmentally Preferable Procurement policy (EPP). The Director of Procurement sent a memo to all deans, directors, and department heads announcing the EPP, which includes a vendor code of conduct.

      with the following standards:

      United States has adopted, whether they apply to foreign countries, political organizations 

      or particular foreign individuals and entities.

      Suppliers should not directly or indirectly engage in or support any terrorist activity.  Neither

      suppliers nor any of their affiliates, nor any officer or director of the supplier or any of its 

      affiliates, should be included on any lists of terrorists or terrorist organizations compiled by

      University’s computer system, including its electronic mail system and internet site, for the 

      purpose of sending unsolicited electronic mail messages to the University community.

      Suppliers must receive prior written authorization from the University’s Purchasing 

      Department to hold trade shows, demonstrate products, utilize University resources (i.e., 

      bulletin boards), or make unsolicited calls on University departments.

      Monitoring and Compliance

      Suppliers shall conduct audits and inspections to insure their compliance with this Supplier 

      Code of Conduct and applicable legal requirements.  If a supplier identifies areas of non-

      compliance, the supplier agrees to notify the Purchasing Department as to its plans to 

      remedy any such non-compliance.

      The University or its representatives may engage in monitoring activities to confirm 

      Supplier’s compliance to this Supplier Code of Conduct, including on-site inspections of 

      facilities, use of questionnaires, review of publicly available information, or other measures 

      necessary to assess supplier’s performance.

      Any University supplier or University employee that becomes aware of violations of this 

      policy is obligated to notify the Purchasing Department.  Based on the assessment of 

      information made available to the University, the University of Pittsburgh reserves the 

      right (in addition to all other legal and contractual rights) to disqualify any potential supplier

      or terminate any relationship with any current supplier found to be in violation of this 

      Supplier Code of Conduct without liability to the University.

      between this Policy and any University solicitation document or applicable agreement, the 

      terms of the University solicitation or agreement shall control.

      No exclusions are applicable to this policy.

Vanderbilt University,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 10:46:23,andrea.george@vanderbilt.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Some,All,,"8.16 Green Purchasing Program
In order to reduce the adverse environmental impact of our purchasing decisions and in accordance with the VU Environmental Commitment Statement Vanderbilt University is committed to purchasing goods and services from manufacturers and suppliers who share our environmental concern and commitment. Green purchasing is the method wherein environmental and social considerations are taken into account with the price, availability and performance criteria that we use to make purchasing decisions.
Environmentally-preferable products have a reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared to other products and companies that serve the same purpose. It is the preference of Vanderbilt University that our suppliers use environmentally-preferable products, materials, and sources wherever economically feasible. If two products are competitive in performance characteristics and pricing, the university will favor the more environmentally-preferable product or company.
The university and the supplier may negotiate during the contract term to permit the substitution or addition of environmentally-preferable products when such products are readily available at a competitive cost and satisfy the university’s performance needs. If a supplier is citing environmentally preferable product claims, the supplier must be able to provide proper certification or detailed information on environmental benefits, durability and recyclable properties.

Procurement Services has worked closely with the university’s preferred office products, janitorial products, and laboratory products suppliers to provide more easily identified environmentally-preferable product selections. These products are readily identifiable in eProcurement and have been collected into special “green purchasing” catalogs that anyone can request.
A basic screen for environmentally-preferable products is to look for those that are reusable instead of disposable, recyclable, made with renewable energy, and contain a significant percentage of post-consumer waste recycled content. Additionally, third-party certification systems that indicate an environmentally-preferable product include:
1. “Energy Star”: indicates a product has met strict energy efficiency guidelines as set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy (DOE).
2. “EPEAT”: indicates electronics that are environmentally-preferable as determined by the EPA and Green Electronics Council.
3. “FSC-Certified”: indicates products that have met the requirements of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for responsible management of forest resources, such as office paper.
4. “SCS Recycled Content”: indicates a product that has been certified for recycled content and meets the stringent EPS standard for providing a measurable and significant environmental benefit over typical products in the same category.
5. “CRI Green Label”: Product certified by the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) to improve indoor air quality.
6. EPA Design for the Environment (DfE): EPA has screened each ingredient for potential human health and environmental effects and that-based on currently available information, EPA predictive models, and expert judgment-the product contains only those ingredients that pose the least concern among chemicals in their class.
7. “Green Seal certified”: Products certified by Green Seal to meet environmentally-responsible design, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation requirements.
8. “Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Certified”: indicates products that have met the requirements of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative that promotes sustainable forest management, improved forestry practices and responsible purchasing of forest products such as office paper.  
","Procurement Services is responsible for overseeing the commercial relationships between Vanderbilt University and our suppliers and insuring that all aspects of our relationships are held to the highest ethical and professional standards. Our suppliers contribute significantly to the ongoing success of Vanderbilt University and we in turn actively support our suppliers and help them achieve their objectives. 

All vendors are assessed according to the following criteria: environmentally responsible practices including sourcing and transportation practices, the use of post-consumer content and cradle-to cradle product design and production. Vanderbilt’s Sustainability Director is involved in reviewing vendor proposals and choosing vendors for major contracts, such as office supplies, janitorial supplies, solid waste and recycling management, etc.  Vanderbilt’s Procurement program offers numerous environmentally friendly products and product lines, which are designated as such to Procurement users. All LEED-certified buildings have environmental performance requirements in their procurement contracts for building materials and other equipment.  Other areas not listed above that include environmental performance requirements in procurement contracts are: solid waste management, furniture, chemical supplies, lab supplies and equipment, and travel. Most recently during an RFP for an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) contract, preference was given to vendors who showed strong environmental standards.

Westminster College,2016-02-25,2016-02-25 14:15:57,kcase@westminstercollege.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Some,Some,,"Two years ago the College intentionally hired a food service provider (Bon Appetit) that committed to the “Real Food Challenge”, that had company practices for sustainability and nutritious food. The Food Service contract was drafted with these policies. Please note that the Real Food Challenge is an amendment that will be signed shortly. Bon Appetit also works with a program called Farm to Fork, which focuses are getting local food, owner-operated.  The College Master Plan calls for all new construction to have a goal to design to LEED Gold construction and all remodels that exceeds 50% of the original building should be designed to at least a LEED Silver construction. The Meldrum Science Center achieved a Platinum LEED certificate, the construction of Westminster on the Draw and the Bassis Student Center both were constructed to Silver LEED standards.","The College has set LEED policies for construction and has incorporated these policies into agreements for construction. Meetings with Building Contractors ensures that these standards will be delivered on which usually occur weekly. Currently, there is no significant construction occurring. There are numerous groups that monitor food, waste practices and chemical storage and disposal, some of those include: Chemical Safety Committee, Food Service Committee, Risk Management Committee and the Sustainability Council. There are numerous employee positions that monitor these practices: Director of Environmental Health and Safety, Director of Safety and Campus Fire marshal, Managing Director of Administration, VP of Finance & Administration, and the President. We have seen significant behavior changed in our food service operations and construction practices over the last few years.",--,--
