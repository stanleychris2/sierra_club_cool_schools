Records of previous data are kept in an ongoing log tracking correspondents, conversations, and calculations.
Below are details of how this data was obtained and measured.
o Institutional Data: Population numbers were primarily taken directly from the Office of Institutional Research and
Planning (IRAP) website.
o Steam and Backup Generators: Steam production and on-campus fuel combustion data was taken from the USI
report.
o Fleet Vehicles: Mileage related to travel in university-owned vehicles was reported by Motor Pool Services.
o Refrigerants/Chemicals: Records of refrigerant and chemical usage were reported by Motor Pool Services, HVAC
Maintenance Services, and Food Services.
o Agriculture: Agricultural operations records were obtained from Landscape Services and the Sustainable
Development Research & Teaching Farm
o Purchased Electricity: On-campus electricity consumption data was obtained from the ASU USI report. Fuel mix
information used to produce electricity at Appalachian and records of electricity use at University Highlands
Apartments were obtained from New River Light & Power. The Controller’s Office provided electricity records of
buildings owned by ASU that are not on-campus.
o Faculty/Staff and Student Commuting: Information for FY 2006 through FY 2011 was taken from the 2009
transportation survey. The transportation subcommittee of the Sustainability Council conducted a campus-wide
survey in fall of 2013 and this data was used for FY 2012 and 2013.
o Directly Financed Outsourced Travel: The Controller’s Office organized and provided records of universityfinanced
air and ground travel.
o Study Abroad: The Office of International Education and Development reported the number of passengers and flight
destinations for study abroad trips. This information was then used to estimate mileage using an online air travel
calculator.
o Solid Waste: The Office of Sustainability tracks on-campus solid waste generation, composting, and recycling
information.
o Wastewater: Wastewater data was taken directly from the USI report.
o Paper: Central Warehouse provided purchasing records of standard white copy paper used throughout the
university. The Graphic Arts and Imaging Technology (GAIT) department reported records of the specialty paper
used in their department.
o Offsets: Offset calculations are based on tons of compost and acres of preserved forest. In previous years, land
acquired from the SD farm was included, but this is not documented forest preservation. Previous years’ offsets
have been adjusted accordingly.
o Scope 2 T&D Losses: This number is an automatic calculation that the CCC creates based on purchased electricity.",TRUE,**,TRUE,**,"For the Performance Year reported, Appalachian did not engage a institution-catalyzed carbon offset program.",0,"Appalachian State manages campus trees as well as the adjacent Nature Preserve using i-Tree Eco protocols.

portions of the campus (85.8 ha) with the adjacent, unmanaged Nature Preserve (27.1 ha), both of which are part of campus. i-Tree Eco protocols were applied to all trees
inventoried on the managed campus, as well as plot-based samples in the Nature Preserve. On the managed campus, 3,228 trees were inventoried representing 86 species. Diameter at breast height (DBH) ranged from 3 cm to 186 cm while tree height ranged from 2 m to 40 m. The Nature Preserve contains approximately 18,812 trees belonging to 25 species.

In September 2011, the university completed this state-of-the-art composting facility that expands our annual composting capacity from 100 to 275 tons. The increased capacity will allow the university to expand food waste composting opportunities and further our commitment to sustainability.

Of the nine tracked major emission sources, seven of Appalachian 
State University’s numbers increased from 2009. The two that show to 
be on the decrease, are the Scope I source for steam (natural gas) and 
scope III emissions from the university fleet of vehicles. The gains in steam can be explained by increased use of automatic building controls (scheduling occupancy times) increased vigilance of a stream-trap preventative maintenance routine and large scale repairs to the subterranean campus steam infrastructure. The decrease in fleet emissions is a result of correcting an oversight in the historic data collection process by which mass-transit emissions were counted in two places. This does not represent a decrease in emissions produced, merely an improvement in carbon accounting.

During 2011/2012, it purchased panels for the Worner Center (63,000 kWh) and in 2012/2013 for KRCC (3,240 kWh) and the Children's Center (25,200 kWh). In 2014, CC installed new solar arrays on the El Pomar Sports Center (278,000 kWh/yr), the Cornerstone Arts Center (164,600 kWh/yr), Spencer Center (18 kW array), Synergy House (4.3 kW array), and the Dean's house (10.7 kW array). In 2015, the college installed a new solar array at the Baca campus (31 kW array) of which the college owns the RECs. 

In addition, the institution generates offsets through its Energy Audit and Retrofit Program.  The program offers students enrolled in the ""Energy"" (EV 212) course an opportunity to learn the science and mechanics behind energy audits and retrofits through hands-on practice and community-based service.  After conducting the audit and obtaining an air exchange value, students work to improve the building's efficiency by installing additional insulation.  The project targets low-income neighborhoods and typically results in one completed house per year.  However, even though the program has reduced emissions, there is not sufficient data to include these offsets in the number for ""institution-catalyzed carbon offsets generated"".

The program accommodates all pre- and post consumer food waste from dining & catering and paper towel waste from campus bathrooms.  Compost waste is handled through CC's facilities management contractor Sodexo and is hulled from the college to a waste management site via a local company Bestway Disposal. Compost used on-site at the CC Farm is purchased from an off-site facility. Additionally, the grounds department has a composting bin for landscaping waste. ","In November 2012, the College purchased 230 kW of solar panels in SunShare's solar garden project. As part of this purchase, the College receives all energy produced by the panels for the next twenty years and renewable energy certificates from SunShare each year. For the 2013 academic year these certificates totaled 462 MWh's. The college has purchased four shares for offsets at solar gardens. 

Beginning in 2012, CC has purchased blocks of green power from Colorado Springs Utilities on a monthly basis. The wind power is generated from the Ponnequin Wind Facility, located along the Colorado-Wyoming border. One block is equal to 100-kilowatt hours of electricity. Colorado College has purchased enough blocks to generate 2,000,000 kWh. REC's have been verified through Green-e, an independent certification program.

Additionally, the college has purchased two new shares with CSU of which CC now owns the RECs.

In the first four years, as directed by the Sustainability Plan drafted in 2009, Colorado College reduced carbon emissions by more than 20% and saved $1.74 million in utility costs. Utilities management at Colorado College has become an area of increased emphasis. In FY13 CC experienced continued success in decreasing energy use and costs campus-wide. Cumulative avoided costs for utilities are estimated in excess of $2.1M since the 2008 baseline. Recent and notable accomplishments include: hiring of a full-time on Campus Energy Manager; developing the Carbon Neutrality Plan through collaboration between the Office of Sustainability, Facilities Services, and the Campus Sustainability Council; increasing renewable energy purchases via wind from Colorado Springs Utilities and solar from SunShare; introducing Sofame Heat Recovery at the Central Heating Plant, the building of various solar arrays on buildings around campus including the dean's house, Synergy house, Gaylord Apartments, The Worner Center, El Pomar Center, and Cornerstone Arts Center. The Dean's house and Synergy House are now net-zero buildings. 

A Campus-Micro Grid is in the initial stages of execution. This project would create a campus micro grid to reduce carbon emissions by combining heat and power processes, reduce energy costs by peak shaving, and provide infrastructure to critical infrastructure to support emergency operations. Currently during a power outage, CC can operate the central plant, but does not have power to circulate water through the buildings connected to the high temperature hot water distribution system. This project would construct a 400kW combined heat and power system at the central plant. The system would run off of natural gas and provide emergency power to the Worner Center to support cooking operations and El Pomar for use as an emergency shelter. The system would achieve carbon savings and payback by operating in parallel to with the utility grid during summer peak demand periods. This would reduce demand at the central plant, also know as peak-shaving. 

LED lighting in Schlessman pool and also Honnen Ice Arena replace light bulbs with more energy efficient LED bulbs, reducing GHG emissions generated from coal. LED lighting has been implemented throughout campus grounds as well.

These goals include generating approximately 180,000 metric tons of CO2e in emission reductions (approximately 55% of the University's emissions baseline) by 2024 and annually thereafter to meet the University's climate neutrality commitment, to supply the internal University community with offsets in the near term, and to serve as a resource for other universities and organizations, particularly those in the Southeast, that are interested in generating or purchasing offsets. The Initiative works both within Duke University and outside the University with other institutions and partners to build meaningful offset projects and to facilitate and catalyze the development of offset projects and offset market transactions, particularly those projects and transactions which offer innovative and cost-effective approaches. 

The Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative has developed internal carbon programs and protocols, which include swine-based agricultural methane, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and urban forestry offsets. The University has focused on swine waste-to-energy first because of the large number of swine farms in the state and the opportunity they present to eliminate a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in ways that will generate renewable energy and solve other major pollution problems, such as nutrient loading and odors. Currently, the Initiative is partnering with Duke Energy, Google Inc., and a North Carolina farm to pilot the first anaerobic-digester based innovative swine waste management system which meets stringent environmental performance standards and produces renewable energy to help Duke Energy meet its renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standard commitment for swine-based energy. 

The innovative system controls greenhouse gas emissions from a working farm by capturing methane from the animal waste and generating renewable energy by combusting the methane in a microturbine. Use of an innovative system means that in addition to the GHG reductions and renewable energy production, the farm must meet stringent environmental performance standards that require substantial reductions in farm ammonia emissions, pathogens, nutrients, odors and metals and eliminates discharge of waste into surface and groundwater.  Research is underway to analyze the system, including a mass balance of nitrogen in the swine waste as it travels through the waste management system and the minimization of the operating time of the jet aeration system, as well as alternatives to jet aeration, to achieve the same environmental results with less electricity and therefore less cost.

The University also has developed an employee-based benefit program that encourages homeowners to increase the energy efficiency of their homes. This program breaks down a number of barriers by providing information on energy efficiency retrofits though home energy audits, identifying high-quality contractors, and offering a low-interest rate loan. This project was piloted starting October 2014 and has provided home energy audits to 30 Duke employees. A majority of employees have increased their home’s energy efficiency through simple projects like changing light bulbs to larger retrofits such as re-insulation and duct sealing. Duke’s own employees are helping Duke meet its climate neutrality commitment, making it truly a Duke community effort. The University is also collecting data and conducting research on program results in order to identify and share best practices with other colleges and universities.

With respect to forestry-based offset projects, the University is evaluating opportunities to develop projects involving afforestation, avoided conversion and improved forest management. The University works with Trees Across Durham, which is a coalition of local government, non-profits, and citizens whose goal is to increase the canopy cover across the city and county of Durham. Starting this upcoming planting season, the University will be working with and providing resources to Trees Across Durham to plant more trees. Over time, these trees will sequester carbon and reduce pollutants in the air, all while providing opportunities to volunteer and build new partnerships.

In addition to the enterprise-wide operational recommendations, the Climate Action Plan asked academic departments and operations to develop emission reduction plans. These individual Plans lay out various strategic paths toward reducing the carbon emissions of each academic unit in the areas of sustainable building and construction, energy, transportation, waste management, food, procurement, academic programs, and individual action. These efforts include, operationally, retrofits to existing buildings, greening new buildings by following LEED standards, retrofits to stationary combustion sources (i.e., steam plant) to make it burn fuel more efficiently, evaluating sources of renewables, building a water reclamation facility, and moving towards  Zero Waste facilities on campus through a multitude of recycling opportunities.

All other GHG Inventory data is from FY13.  GW is currently in the process of updating all other emissions and scheduled to complete this study by May 2016.  

GW's GHG emissions were calculated using the University of New Hampshire’s Campus Carbon Calculator (CCC) (v.6.9 and v.8). 

GW used an operational control approach to determine the scope of its footprint. The guiding principle of GW's inventory is to include facilities that are owned or leased by the University that house activities and/or personnel that directly contribute to (e.g., classrooms, offices, research laboratories) and/or support (e.g., administrative offices, student medical clinic, and warehouse space) its academic mission. All facilities used for University purposes that are either owned and operated or rented from a third party are included. Buildings GW owns but rents to others were excluded as they do not house GW personnel or activities, and as such, GW does not control consumption patterns in these locations.

Certain assumptions were used in assembling this inventory, including the following:
Metrics for emissions from leased building spaces included certain assumptions, as the University is limited in its ability to track emissions from spaces it does not own/manage. For this metric, emissions were calculated using the following energy estimates in kBTU/GSF: 45 for warehouses, 83 for classrooms, 93 for offices, and 105 for medical spaces. Energy consumption is allocated as 50% from electricity and 50% from natural gas. These figures were based on existing data from similar buildings and Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Information Administration's (EIA's) 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data. 

Additionally, air travel mileage is not tracked at present, although information on dollars spent is available. Therefore, to develop a mileage figure, dollars spent were converted into miles flown (per AASHE's suggestion). Our air travel mileage is based on the separate dollars spent on international and domestic flights during FY2013, divided by the respective factors of dollars-per-air-mile-traveled for 2012 as tabulated by the Airlines for America (formerly Air Transport Association of America).

The commuting emissions data do not include student travel to/from campus at the beginning/end of each semester. In early 2016, GW performed a comprehensive transportation survey of each population (students, staff, and faculty), to improve upon the 2010 data used in our FY2013 GHG inventory. A survey completed in 2005 was used for GW’s initial baseline GHG inventory for FY2008. The data for the FY2015 inventory are based on this newest survey and improve data accuracy.

Capital Partners Solar Project is an innovative renewable energy project that generates electricity at three project sites for the George Washington University (GW), American University (AU) and the George Washington University Hospital (GWUH). It is comprised of 52 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic (PV) power.

During 2015, the project delivered 21,875.80 MWh of renewable energy to GW in its first year. At the time of signing the contract in 2014, GW's share of the purchase represented the largest ever non-utility solar PV power purchase agreement (PPA) in the United States in terms of total megawatt-hours contracted over the life of the 20-year contract term.

Below the Solar Walk is the world’s first walkable solar-paneled pathway which includes 27 slip-resistant, semitransparent panels comprising 100 square feet. In peak conditions the walkable panels, designed by Spain-based Onyx Solar, generate enough energy to power 450 LED pathway lights, while the panels on the trellis generate energy that feeds nearby Innovation Hall.",1,"GW has committed through its Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy to enhance tree canopy and green cover to help increase sequestration potential and outdoor air filtration capacity. In the near term, the university commits to offset the square foot loss of existing tree canopy and green cover from natural causes or campus development with new plantings. GW will do so by factoring green cover into campus development and conducting annual campus tree surveys to measure progress. 

Casey Trees, a non-profit organization, performed GW's initial tree inventory. The inventory occurred in two parts, the first was in spring 2009 and covered only the Foggy Bottom Campus. The second occurred in late 2009 and covered the Mount Vernon Campus. Casey Trees surveyed both campus and street trees (city-owned) and gathered information about tree species, size, and location. This information was uploaded into the Forest Service's Street Tree Management Tool for Urban Forest Managers (STRATUM) model and yielded 196 metric tons of carbon dioxide benefit, net of decomposition and maintenance losses.

STRATUM was developed by researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service Center for Urban Forest Research. This model quantifies the structure, function, and value of a city's street trees. This run of the model was calibrated for trees in the Piedmont Climate Zone, which includes Washington, DC and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southern states.

One of the tenets of GW's Climate Action Plan is to identify credible local offset programs to offset emissions the university cannot reduce (i.e. air travel for faculty to conferences). As GW works toward its carbon neutrality goals, the university will continue to seek projects to invest in to identify ways to reduce its carbon footprint through local measures.","(From OP-23)

Composting & Carbon Storage:

Pre-Consumer Composting -- GW's Mount Vernon Campus dining hall has participated in pre-consumer food waste collection for about five years. Beginning in the fall of 2014, the pre-consumer food waste collection program was expanded to include the JStreet dining hall at the GW Foggy Bottom Campus. JStreet Dining is the main dining hall for the university and serves hundreds of students daily.

Post-Consumer Composting -- GW has post-consumer composting at Pelham Commons, the major dining facility at the Mount Vernon Campus. GW also collects post-consumer compost at designated events. At roughly ten events per year, composting is available. These include large catered events and sporting concessions.","The university purchased Green-e certified renewable energy certificates (RECs) from local and/or nationwide wind energy farms, including 3Degrees, Inc. During the reporting year, GW applied RECs (that had been purchased in previous years) as a component of LEED certification applications for several construction projects - Law Learning Center, Law Clinic Townhouses, GW Museum and Textile Museum, Milken Institute School of Public Health, and Ross Hall.

Energy use in existing buildings comprises 70 percent of the university's GHG emissions. In the first years of implementing the Climate Action Plan, GW has prioritized improving building energy efficiency and enhancing IT systems that result in energy use reductions. 

GW's Eco Building Program provides a comprehensive capital improvement plan to strategically implement energy and water conservation projects in campus buildings.  Implementation of this program will result in a reduction of energy and water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and will produce short-term and long-term financial savings. Through these projects, GW aims to reduce energy use from the buildings by 15%. 

Within the last 4 years, 30% of GW's buildings (by square footage) have undergone an energy-efficiency oriented retrofit as part of the Eco Building Program. Work will continue in the coming years, with capital projects already scheduled.

On-Site Thermal Hot Water:

The university installed solar hot water systems at these residence halls: 2031 F St., 1959 E St., Shenkman Hall, and The Dakota residence hall.

Renewable Energy Credits (RECs):

The university purchased Green-e certified renewable energy certificates (RECs) from local and/or nationwide wind energy farms, including 3Degrees, Inc. During the reporting year, GW applied RECs (that had been purchased in previous years) as a component of LEED certification applications for several construction projects - Law Learning Center, Law Clinic Townhouses, GW Museum and Textile Museum, Milken Institute School of Public Health, and Ross Hall. RECs were also donated by Direct Energy, an energy supply firm, to offset the natural gas used on Earth Day.

Building Temperature Standards:

GW's design standards include winter and summer temperature ranges for designers of new buildings to achieve. In existing buildings, GW has begun to use Coris Outlet Modules, which are Internet-controlled packaged A/C unit (""window shaker"") timers.  Programmable thermostats are also employed.

LED Lighting:

GW has used LED lighting in exit signs for many years. At the end of FY11 the university began retrofitting its underground parking garages with LED lighting and occupancy sensors. GW now has five underground parking garages using LED lighting and occupancy sensors. In FY12 GW installed LED lights as house lights in its historic Lisner Auditorium theater. GW is now installing LED lights into a wider range of fixtures including interior and exterior uses.

Occupancy Sensors:

The most common type of occupancy sensor used to control lighting on campus is a dual-technology sensor that detects both motion or sound. These are usually mounted into ceilings of public spaces such as classrooms and conference rooms. In smaller rooms such as public bathrooms a sensor detects motion to bring lights on and then the lights go off again a pre-set amount of time later such as 15 minutes. This application is now switching to the use of vacancy sensors instead. Some daylight sensors are in use in lobbies with a lot of natural light. Most outdoor lighting is controlled by timers or photocells.

Passive Solar:

The University has a few buildings that incorporate passive solar heating. One example is our two greenhouses. Three buildings on GW's campuses -- Ames Hall, Rice Hall, and 45155 Research Place -- include a total of approximately 3,500 square-feet of solar window films to reduce solar incidence into spaces to help prevent overheating, in turn reducing peak air conditioning loads during warmer months of the year. 

Cogeneration:

A new CHP unit in Ross Hall was constructed on GW's Foggy Bottom Campus. The 5-MW cogeneration unit is designed to supply approximately two-thirds of the combined electricity demand for Ross Hall and the Science and Engineering Hall, as well as heat for the two buildings. Due to the timing, Scope 1 emissions will be reported in GW’s FY16 GHG inventory.

Building Commissioning/Retrofits:

GW has commissioned all of its new buildings for the past 20 years. While a formal recommissioning program has not been implemented to date, two pilot-scale recommissioning activities have been undertaken. In one building a continuous commissioning project was used for a year and in another LEED-certified building a recommissioning effort was undertaken to correct a higher-than-expected energy usage.  A formal building retrofit program is now underway; see its description above under ""Eco Building Program"" and below under ""Energy-Efficient Equipment,"" the description of the institution's program to replace energy-consuming equipment with higher-efficiency alternatives.  

Energy Metering/Building Management Systems:

The University's building management systems (BMS) currently interconnect 40 buildings with either remote monitoring or control functionality. In terms of the absolute number of buildings with BMSs the coverage is small (~30%) but the buildings with BMSs are the largest buildings on campus so in terms of square footage (or energy usage) the BMS coverage is extensive (~78.5%). The BMS primarily monitors and controls space temperatures, humidity, and HVAC functions rather than lighting. Lighting is generally controlled with local occupancy sensors, daylight sensors, or photocells. One building that opened recently has its lighting system controls integrated into its BMS.

Energy-Efficient Equipment:

Four years ago, the University launched its Eco Building Program to reduce energy usage and GHG emissions in existing buildings. To date, three phases of projects have been conducted, covering ten major buildings.

Energy-Efficient Landscape Design:

The University has begun replacing a variety of exterior lighting with LED alternatives.  Two other initiatives were described in response to OP-9 where renewable energy sources have been incorporated into the landscape to power LED lights along a pathway and to allow students to recharge their laptops, tablets, and phones.

Vending Machines:

We currently have ""SnackMisers"" on two vending machines on campus, which control the energy use of the machines based on motion. We piloted twelve of these products, but it was determined that it is not the best fit for GW's vending machines, so we continue to explore additional options. 

Other Initiatives:

GW has undertaken several behavior-change initiatives aimed at reducing energy usage and GHG emissions. The Eco-Challenge competition has been used for many years as a way to engage students living on campus in a friendly energy-reducing competition. This competition has expanded to include many academic buildings. There are now two kiosks on campus that display the energy usage of many campus buildings, with a third to be added during the Spring 2015 semester in Science and Engineering Hall.",12306.3,196,4,2445.5,--,118,--,--,7068,27,--,22032,5982.5,2258,6571,24,--,20108,5319.5,871,7/1/2014,6/30/2015,7/1/2007,6/30/2008,807183,56665,74187,18197.5,11635,370.9,--,6349,10.1,25,Website URL provided above: URL is for the FY2013 Emissions Inventory; GW is scheduled to complete the FY15 Inventory by May 2016.

Through FY 2013, GMC’s offset provider was Green Mountain Power’s Cow Power Program, which offered high-end offsets for methane destruction affiliated with the College’s purchase of premium electricity. In FY 2015, the Sustainability Office launched a college-wide effort to select another offset provider given Green Mountain Power’s focus on the renewable energy credit market and the expensive nature of verifying and retiring offsets from small projects.
 
The effort to find a new offset provider involved five classes and over 50 students. The Sustainability Office worked with key faculty members to develop an RfP (Request for Proposals) that was then provided to several classes, so that students could gain experience working as environmental consultants.  

The winner of the campus-wide vetting process was Native Energy’s Seneca Meadows Landfill Gas project. The project, located in Waterloo, NY, captures methane from a landfill and either flares the methane or uses it to turn turbines to create electricity. Whether it flares or creates energy at any given time is dependent on how pure the gas is. Less pure gas is flared. The project was third-party verified by First Environment, and the offsets were retired on the American Carbon Registry with a vintage date of 2014, the most recent vintage date available at the time the offsets were purchased in September of 2015.

The majority of the reductions come from operations at the biomass plant. Every year the college increases the efficiency of the biomass plant, so that it carries a greater percentage of the heat and hot water load for central campus. Improvements since 2013 include a switch from #6 oil as a back-up to less carbon-intensive #2 oil, running the plant through the summer for hot water, and upgrades to some steam pipe components. The biomass is now covering 85% of the heat and hot water load for campus.
Agriculture’s impact was reduced due to the decrease in the number of cows and pigs being raised on the campus farm. Campus fleet fuel use emissions have been reduced due to a concerted effort to do more local trips in the adventure education program. Stationary fuel use, including heat and hot water, went down, in part, because of small projects like the Two Editors Inn renovation, stemming from a weatherization class. These actions have a noticeable impact on the total scope one emissions over time.

Scope 2
The College utilizes a $30,000 green revolving loan fund to support energy efficiency projects. A projected 7.5% energy reduction through a suite of small electric efficiency projects allowed the College to achieve Efficiency Vermont’s Energy Leadership Challenge in 2013. GMC’s annual Do it in the Dark competition works to educate students, staff and faculty on electricity savings through changing behavior. The Do it the Dark competition usually yields a 10% reduction on average during the competition period. Some groups, such as the Vermont Summer Academy have achieved an over 50% reduction in the residence halls. Gains in overall efficiency have been made despite an overall growth in the square footage of campus buildings.
  
Scope 3
The sustainability office has worked hard to recycle and compost a greater portion of the college’s waste stream through increasing the efficiency of the crew, installing new home-made waste stations, and carrying out educational efforts. In fact, the sustainability office increased waste diversion by over 20% over the last three years to achieve a total diversion rate of 50%.

Since 2010, MIT has collaborated with its utility NSTAR to implement energy efficiency strategies such as lighting retrofits, high-performance new construction, and improved heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems through the “MIT Efficiency Forward” program. This multi-million dollar investment has touched at least 85% of campus buildings and reduced campus electricity use by 15%. MIT and NSTAR recently renewed their partnership through 2015 with the goal of saving an additional 21 million kilowatt-hours annually.

MIT was one of the first American universities to adopt comprehensive green building standards. All new construction and major renovations on campus must meet or exceed the Silver standards of the US Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program. For instance, the Sloan School of Management and the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research are Gold certified and met or surpassed energy performance expectations. The newly renovated and restored Maseeh Hall and Arthur D. Little Building are Gold certified and designed to use a third less energy than comparable buildings built only to required codes. MIT also joined the US Department of Energy’s new Global Superior Energy Performance Partnership to implement advanced energy efficiency strategies in the Stata Center and the W91 Data Center. 

MIT’s Department of Facilities actively encourages alternative transportation modes, keeping MIT’s proportion of single occupant vehicle trips significantly below state and national averages. MIT’s aggressive transportation demand management programs include subsidized MBTA passes, rideshare, van pool, local car sharing services, significant investments in bicycle infrastructure, and the MIT Bicycle Commuter Benefit Program (which offers a $240/year reimbursement for full-time employees who bike to work). In addition, MIT's Department of Facilities partnered with the City of Cambridge to install publicly available electric vehicle charging stations on campus.

Therefore building renovation and the selection of appliances that minimize energy use (see Section III on buildings) is an essential strategy to pursue. From 2011-2013 a comprehensive lighting retrofit effort upgraded ballasts, lamps, and fixtures in more than 80% of campus buildings, as well as parking lots and outdoor lights. However, room for substantial additional improvement remains. The College will achieve greater energy reductions by improving the thermal efficiencies of buildings and the operating efficiencies of equipment. The development of energy zones will also result in efficiency savings.

- Behavior change: Energy conservation through behavior change is one of the most effective and least expensive ways to reduce energy consumption; it is estimated that at least 10% of the carbon reductions required to achieve carbon neutrality can come from behavior change. The College is currently pursuing several strategies to encourage resource conservation.  All dorm residents and some staff members have access to real-time feedback about their building’s resource use through the Campus Resource Monitoring System (http://buildingdashboard.net/oberlin/).  Research conducted by faculty and students at Oberlin and elsewhere has demonstrated that providing feedback on resource use can reduce electricity consumption by up to 56% during a 3 week long energy reduction competitions among dormitories. “Environmental orbs” that glow different colors depending on current rates of electricity and water use provide a highly accessible source of feedback, and are installed in most dormitories. Expanding and improving the monitoring of resource use in buildings should remain a priority when renovations or new construction make it possible.

The College has begun a research project using Community-Based Social Marketing techniques to identify and influence high-impact behaviors through behavior change programs. Behavior change strategies will include incentives designed to encourage students, faculty, and staff to purchase and manage personal electronic equipment to minimize energy use; educational campaigns, like the Green Room and Green Office programs, to encourage energy conservation practices; and outreach efforts to encourage carpooling and biking. The College also boasts one of the most longstanding energy conservation competitions in the country: Ecolympics. Ecolympics is a three-week water and electricity conservation competition between residence halls tied to the Dashboard monitoring system and a precursor to the nationwide Campus Conservation Nationals. During the three weeks of the competition, there are dozens of campus and community events centered around sustainability -- from film screenings to garden service days.

Bonneville Environmental Foundation has commissioned DNV∙GL to carry out the validation of the project activity “Spelman College: Campus-Wide Clean Energy Efficiency Project”.
As part of the validation process, DNV∙GL has also assessed and verified the project and baseline emissions reported in the VCS project description for the project activity for the period 01 July 2011 to 30 June 2013. 
This verification statement describes the verification conclusions reached by DNV GL on the project and baseline emissions and resulting emission reductions reported in the in the VCS project description for the project activity for the monitoring period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2013.

2	SCOPE OF WORK
Verification is the periodic ex-post independent assessment by a validation/verification body (VVB) of the GHG emission reductions that have occurred as a result of the project during the monitoring period.
The scope of the verification is to verify that the calculation of the GHG emission reductions correctly support the emission reductions being claimed
The project proponents are responsible for the collection of data in accordance with the monitoring plan and the reporting of GHG emissions reductions from the project activity. It is DNV GL’s responsibility to express an independent verification statement on the reported GHG emission reductions from the project activity.
The validation of the project activity included the following steps and the outcome of these steps also formed the basis of this verification statement: 
1.	A desk review of the VCS project description and supporting documents ;
2.	Follow-up interviews (by telephone) with the project proponents;
3.	The resolution of outstanding issues and the issuance of this verification statement.
DNV∙GL has not performed any site inspection for this project activity.
As part of the validation of the project activity, the following supporting documents were assessed by DNV GL and these documents are also the basis for this verification statement:
•	emission reduction calculation spreadsheets;
•	further spreadsheets or other documents containing information on the energy use by the campus; and
•	selected receipts for energy supplied to the campus (A sample of receipts was selected by the project proponent and presented to DNV GL to support the reported emission reductions).
As part of the planned further verification activities for this project activity, DNV GL may select additional samples of data and information to be verified and may also perform site inspection for this project activity. These further verification activities may reveal material misstatements in the reported emission reductions and thus may result in changes to the reported emission reductions. Nonetheless, based on the information reviewed by DNV∙GL so far, DNV∙GL is able to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the reported emission reductions are accurate.

The Invertory Instructions are as follows-

Principles for a Carbon Emissions Inventory:

 1. Completeness: All fuel types and facilities are accounted for in the Inventory.
 2. Consistency: The same methodology is used to calculate energy use and emissions each year.

Steps for Completing the Carbon Emissions Inventory:

1. Identify Facilities

Identify all buildings and facilities that make up your organization, including all rental properties that your organization owns or operates. This will be used to retrieve your energy use data and calculate your gross square footage.

2. Calculate Gross Square Feet

Calculate your facility's total gross square feet by adding together the gross square footage of all owned and leased facilities.

*Note: For information on how to calculate square footage for rental properties, please refer to the Notes section below.

3. Retrieve Energy Use Data

Using your oil bills and monthly utility bills, retrieve energy use data by fuel type for the previous calendar year for all buildings and facilities owned or leased. For example, your 2015 submission will include energy usage from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.

4. Aggregate Energy Use Data

Calculate your organization's total energy use by adding together all energy use by fuel type in owned and leased facilities for the submission year.

*Note: For information on how to calculate energy use from rental properties, please refer to the Notes tab of this spreadsheet.

*Note: For the 2015 Inventory, aggregating energy use by campus is optional--see Step 6 for more information.

5. Input Energy Use Data and Current Square Footage into the Carbon Emissions Inventory

Enter your organization's total energy use by fuel type and total gross square footage under the submission year in the Inventory tab of this spreadsheet. Note that you now have the option of including a biodiesel blend fuel in your inventory, but you must select the blend from the yellow dropdown menu. Please also enter the correct Base Year and Submission Year at the top of the Inventory tab of this spreadsheet.

*Note: Please be sure that your Inventory includes all previous energy use and square footage from your baseline year through the current year.

6. Optional: Input Campus-Level Energy Use and Square Footage Data

If you choose this option, aggregate your organization's energy use by fuel type and gross square footage for each campus and input this information in the Campus tab of this spreadsheet. For the definition of a ""campus,"" please refer to the Notes section below

*Note: The sum of your organization's energy use and gross square footage from each campus should match your total energy use data and gross square footage entered in the Inventory.

7. Optional: Input Waste Tonnage Data

In order to select this option, you must unhide the waste/fleet entry form on the Inventory tab by clicking the yellow button at the top right. If you choose this option, aggregate your organization's annual waste tonnage (short tons) by category (Mixed MSW, Mixed Recycled, Compost) using monthly carter bills or an annual report. If you have completed a physical waste audit, fill out the 'Waste Characterization %' column in addition to the annual Mixed MSW tonnage data, otherwise leave that column blank. Annual tonnage of recycled/composted waste is not required, but there is a space to report as it is useful information for your Climate Action Plan.

8. Optional: Input Fleet Fuel Use Data

In order to select this option, you must unhide the waste/fleet entry form on the inventory tab by clicking the yellow button at the top right. If you choose this option, aggregate your organization's annual fuel consumption (gallons/year) by fuel type (gasoline, diesel, B20 biodiesel, or B5 biodiesel) and input this information on the 'Transportation' section of the inventory. If your institution has additional types of fuel, please contact Patrick Love at plove@cityhall.nyc.gov.

SESI represents a significant transformation of the university from 100% fossil-fuel-based cogeneration to a more efficient electric heat recovery system and will result in immense benefits for Stanford University in the years to come. 
The program converted Stanford’s heating supply from steam to hot water, requiring the installation of over twenty miles of hot water piping  and changes to the mechanical rooms of 155 buildings. The project also included construction of a new Central Energy Facility (CEF), which came online in April 2015. The CEF includes heat recovery chillers, three large water tanks for thermal energy storage, and a high-voltage substation that receives electricity from the grid. Do to the heat-recovery chillers, the new CEF is 70% more efficient than the old cogeneration plant.

While Stanford has achieved significant emissions reductions in 2015 due to its new energy system (detailed below) and other efficiency efforts, the inclusion of these additional greenhouse gases has increased this year's overall emissions by approximately 4.6%. The numbers reported in this credit for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which include these additional gases, is not necessarily an apples to apples comparison to the baseline year, which only includes carbon dioxide, but Stanford chose to include this slightly larger number in order to be consistent with the 2015 figure that the university will publicly report through TCR.

Please note that the GSF reported for the GHG inventory varies from the campus GSF reported for all other credits. The boundary of the GHG inventory is slightly different from the overall STARS boundary, and the GSF for the GHG inventory boundary is used for this credit. The difference primarily derives from the inclusion of off-campus leased spaces in the GHG inventory boundary. 

The Stanford Energy System Innovations (SESI) project came online in April 2015 and will reduce campus greenhouse gas emissions by 68% by the end of 2016 through utilization of electric heat recovery technology at Stanford’s new Central Energy Facility combined with an agreement to build 78.5 MW of solar PV, 5.5 MW of which will be installed on campus. Details in the descriptive fields of this credit capture improvements that have been made as a result of SESI, but the data used in this credit represent performance years from before SESI came online and thus the scoring of this credit does not capture the benefits that have and will continue to come from this new energy system.

Old method:
GHG emissions inventory is a simple spreadsheet gathering and aggregating information from Tufts' three campuses.  Where possible, data is in fiscal year format to align with Tufts’ fiscal year (which runs from July 1 to June 30).  Each campus has a Data Worksheet, a BTU worksheet, and an emissions worksheet.

",TRUE,--,--,,TRUE,**,TRUE,**,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,**,15734,**,"Tufts developed a methodology for conducting a greenhouse gas emissions inventory for colleges and universities in 2002.  Excerpted from a white paper on the topic:

There are many reasons to embark upon the GHG inventory effort.  Most obviously, it is a tool to assist in the systematic identification and recording of known and unknown sources of GHG emissions at an institution. An indirect benefit of conducting an inventory is the knowledge gained of the structure and operation of the institution, not only for GHG emissions but other emissions and environmental stressors. 

Second, the inventory will provide a benchmark against which improvements can be quantified. Essential to justifying the commitment of resources (i.e. spending money) is an estimation of the quantities of emission reduced related to a specific effort - how much will the effort reduce emissions in units of carbon equivalents and what will it cost? Quantifying the effectiveness of actions that reduce energy and material use and that lead to reductions of emissions will assist in the justification of resources.

Third, the inventory will be a reference to communicate the most important, as well as the not so obvious, emission releases.  Information gathered in the inventory will be used to generate charts and graphs that summarize the importance and status of the emissions reduction effort at your institution.  Further, the inventory will assist in the identification of the aggregate impact of the many actions, small and large, that emit greenhouse gases.  While the environmental impact of one light bulb, one meal or one photocopy is difficult to value, the cumulative effect of everyday actions creates a substantial ecological footprint.  For example, in 1990 Tufts University, an academic institution of 8000 graduate and undergraduate students, served 5 million meals; made 14 million photocopies; used 65 tons of paper towels, consumed 110 million gallons of water and 23 million (kWh) of electricity; generated over 2000 tons of solid waste; and released more than 15,000 metric tones carbon equivalents (MTCE) of GHGs (Creighton 1996) (Gloria 2001). Each source of emission, identified collectively, communicates the importance of an institution's commitment to reduce its contribution to global climate change.

The boilers automatically start and stop and vary production, which minimizes the need to keep a larger boiler on low fire to handle load variations.  The new boilers handle load variation more efficiently in terms of steam output versus gas consumption, and respond more quickly to demand fluctuations to maintain more consistent distribution system temperature and pressure.

A systematic re-insulation of steam lines, valves, and other system appurtenances over the past 3 years has significantly decreased thermal losses in buildings and in the distribution system.  Identification of missing or deficient insulation was one result of an extensive survey of campus utility tunnels to support creation of a Utility-tunnel BIM model.

Two utility-tunnel runs were refurbished or reconstructed to replace deteriorated structure; another run was replaced with direct-bury, highly insulated utility lines.  The deteriorated tunnels were endangering exisitng utilties, which were replaced with new, better-insultated supply lines.

The HVAC systems in about 9 buildings have been upgraded in the past three years to replace older, less efficient equipment, address control issues, better match equipment with current building needs, and increase reliability.

The remaining 4,160-volt distribution circuits on campus were replaced with 13.8-kilovolt circuits.  At the higher voltage, line losses are lower due to lower current.

An ongoing cooling/heating plant energy management system project is centralizing controls on the three plants, which will allow more effective monitoring, equipment dispatch and optimization of total plant operation.  The new system will automate many of the decisions as to what equipment is started and stopped and operational parameters to ensure best use of purchased electricity and natural gas.  By allowing tighter control of system tuning, distributed steam and chilled-water temperatures, and pressures will allow more efficient operation of building HVAC systems.

Un-Islanding of 4.5MW Turbine: The AHSC turbine, a 4.5MW combined cycle unit, was previously islanded to specific equipment located within the refrigeration plant. This precluded the turbine from consistently being able to produce power and steam at maximum output and realize the full benefit of this cogeneration system. The turbine was recently un-islanded and now exports power to the campus electrical grid. This modification in operations now allows the turbine to operate at full power and steam output. With this change, a corresponding decrease in campus greenhouse gas emissions should result. The University’s use of the natural gas turbine in lieu of the local electrical utility, which predominately utilizes coal based production units,is one more step towards reducing the campus carbon footprint.",84.73,116,--,--,--,166,--,--,6789,28,487,42388,12479,3807,6084,25,--,35743,11842,3468,7/1/2014,6/30/2015,7/1/2008,6/30/2009,1262028,807972,--,18113,23540,941,--,--,10683,6115,"All numbers for emissions and weighted campus users have been updated to FY15 data.

conversion project is now complete, including design of the new Campus Energy Centre,
which will replace the campus’ aging steam plant. When complete, the ADES will connect 130 buildings to the more efficient hot water district energy system and will reduce emissions by 22 per cent and result in annualized cost savings and cost avoidance by FY18 of $5.5 million. The steam to hot water conversion will also enable a flexible platform for alternative energy sources and research and demonstration projects. 

• The Continuous Optimization “Building Tune-Up” program is retro-commissioning over 70
buildings, targeted to reduce emissions in core buildings by 10 per cent combined with
behaviour change programs. Implementation was completed in 17 laboratory buildings,

One example, described by a student guest writer for the campus sustainability blog, is the Energy Service Corps, in which UC Davis students and local community members teamed up to provide education about the benefits of energy efficiency and help people make changes in their residences (such as sealing cracks, installing weatherstripping, and changing out lightbulbs) to save energy and thus reduce greenhouse gases.",--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,3747,2,619,27371,19261,--,3257,2,613,20637,15135,--,1/1/2011,12/31/2011,1/1/2000,12/31/2000,3399819,298126,584037,12873,51082,--,--,--,--,--,--

",2835,6232,10766160,--,**,33852,**,--,,,55275,http://rs.acupcc.org/,--,"UC Irvine’s carbon reduction program is aligned with the University of California’s Policy on Sustainable Practices, which until recently had the following goals:
-- By 2020: Reduce emissions to 1990 levels
-- By 2025: Achieve climate neutrality (Scope 1 & 2)
Under the leadership of UC President Janet Napolitano, the policy was amended in November 2013 and established the year 2025 as the date by which the UC system is to be carbon neutral.

The UC Climate Solutions Steering Group – led by Wendell Brase, vice chancellor for administrative and business services at UC Irvine – created a plan to achieve systemwide carbon reduction: “Prospectus for a Sustainable Future” (November 2011). In it, the group identified “deep energy efficiency,” measures that reduce energy consumption and associated carbon emissions by half or more, as the most immediate, cost-feasible strategy to effect a substantial reduction in UC’s carbon footprint. This strategy underpins the systemwide plan, which initially targeted these three areas for deep energy savings: lighting, information technology, and laboratories. UC Irvine’s comprehensive energy program addresses all three.

In particular, UC Irvine’s award-winning Smart Labs Initiative has safely reduced laboratory energy use in new and already energy-efficient retrofitted laboratories by as much as 60 percent. This is a comprehensive program that re-engineers building control systems – ventilation, exhaust and lighting – from top to bottom. Smart Labs uses sensors and software to control lab and building systems (ventilation, HVAC, exhaust, illumination) precisely rather than rely on massive safety margins for ventilation rates, exhaust airspeeds, and other design criteria. This has been what some call a game-changer. Laboratories typically account for two-thirds of the energy used by research universities and have an enormous impact on their carbon footprint.

Additionally, the campus has a robust green building program and currently has 13 buildings that have earned a Platinum rating through the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program and another eight that have achieved a Gold rating.

Finally, UC Irvine has several on-site renewable energy systems. In 2009, 895 kW of photovoltaic panels were installed on 12 roofs. In partnership with the Advanced Power and Energy Program in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, two 53 kW dual-axis tracking high-concentration photovoltaic solar power generators were installed in 2012.

Currently the campus is installing 11,700 solar panels on the top of three parking structures generating up to 3.2 megawatts of power which will quadruple the amount of solar energy generated on campus.

The University of Connecticut has gone to great lengths to make its buildings significantly more energy efficient, including major construction and renovation projects to meet at least LEED Silver certification, replacement of lighting fixtures and bulbs with more efficient technology, a retrocommissioning project to optimize temperature and lighting controls, and encouragement of behavioral changes by students through programs such as the annual EcoMadness energy and water competition. 

Retro-commissioning continued in 2015 with studies at Rome Hall, the Music Building, and at the chilled water entrances of 26 buildings. Combined, these projects are expected to yield $110,000/yr in energy cost savings and reduce UConn’s carbon footprint by 1,000 tons/yr.

It is expected to generate 3.8% of the building’s electricity (approximately 45,800 kilowatt hours per year) and reduce emissions by 38 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.

The panels are equipped with technology that allows for remote monitoring of individual panel performance.  In addition, a meteorological station was installed on the roof to provide information about weather and its impacts on the solar array.  Data from these systems will aid campus research and be made public on a website in the future.

The University is a partner in the Energy Innovation Corridor (EIC) which showcases energy efficiency, renewable energy, transportation and smart technology along the 11 mile area surrounding the planned Central Corridor Light Rail. Funding for the $292,500 system came through the City of Minneapolis as part of a $1.35 million grant awarded to the EIC from the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s Office of Energy Security.  Rebates from Xcel Energy are also helping with installation costs. This new addition to the EIC promotes the latest cutting-edge solar technology. The panels installed are among the most efficient, producing more power per panel than most other solar panels available on the market today.

The solar array is another example of the University’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  In January 2012 the Twin Cities campus released its second climate action plan.  The plan identifies steps the Twin Cities campus will take during the next 10 years to cut its greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half.  To realize this target, the campus is continuing its aggressive effort to reduce campus energy use through programs like the It All Adds Up conservation campaign and Energy Management’s building recommissioning program. 

Collectively, It All Adds Up and building recommissioning have helped the University reduce annual energy use, avoid over $7 million in additional utility costs, and release 50,000 fewer tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The campus’s climate action plan also calls for a switch to more efficient and lower emissions sources of energy production, like the combined heat and power (CHP) facility under construction on the Minneapolis campus.  This facility will more efficiently create steam and electricity for campus use and result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions. 

More information on the CHP and the University’s climate action plan is available online at http://govrelations.umn.edu/capital/power-plant.html and http://z.umn.edu/cap.  "

It has undergone upgrades and expansion to provide an efficient operation supporting the effective management and utilization of nutrients and enhancement of soil health. It provides opportunities for teaching, research and outreach on sustainable reuse of farm and food wastes, and is thereby consistent with UNH's regional and national leadership in sustainable agriculture and food systems..

The resulting compost is used as a soil amendment to maintain fertility and tilth of the NHAES/COLSA/UNH forage fields, the strong majority of which are certified organic and therefore rely on manure and compost applications. Ingredients for the composting operation include NHAES/COLSA dairy and equine bedding and manure, food and bakery waste from UNH Dining Services, and leaves and grass clippings from UNH Grounds and Roads operations. Importantly, our composted materials make use of pulped pre- and post-consumer food wastes from the UNH dining halls, an innovative and sustainable practice that productively diverts in excess of 25,000 pounds per month of material which would otherwise go directly into the Durham waste stream. Funding and labor for the operation comes from NHAES/College of Life Sciences and Agriculture and UNH Dining, with several additional campus partners including the UNH Sustainability Academy, Provost Office, Parent's Association and President's Office.

Love Hill is one of the highest points in Nashville and the wind speeds atop the hill are suitable for wind power generation, especially during the windy months of November through April. In the first phase of the project, a wind monitoring station was set up at Love Hill to measure and establish analytical models for energy production. Owing to the proximity of homes, and considering issues of neighborhood aesthetics and noise, only a modest 3 kW turbine has been installed. The wind power is complemented by solar power of 4.8 kW capacity. The electricity at the site does not return directly to the Vanderbilt campus. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lc/

The decommissioning of the plant’s last coal boiler in December 2014 brings the power plant’s 126-year reliance on coal to an end. The modern structure, built in 1962, has been partially powered by natural gas since 1988, but still burned 105 million pounds of coal and produced 15 million pounds of ash waste per year. Authority (TVA).

The environmental benefits of the conversion are significant. Greenhouse gas emissions—the carbon footprint of the power plant—will go down by as much as 40 percent. The conversion will also decrease the emission of particulate matter by more than 50 percent and virtually eliminates emissions of mercury, hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide and other air pollutants.

Operationally, converting to natural gas will make the plant more efficient, require far less maintenance and be more reliable. Additionally, it will be better able to meet stricter EPA regulations. Other initiatives include:
o	Hiring a Campus Energy Manager to implement building retrofits and energy efficiency projects.
o	Making TVA’s Green Power Switch a part of VU’s power portfolio (Vanderbilt is the largest purchaser of green power in the NES distribution area).
o	Launching the campus-wide ThinkOne energy conservation campaign and the Eco-Dores environmental peer residential mentoring program to promote smart and efficient use of utilities via education and behavior change.
o	Implementation of aggressive night temperature and lighting set back programs, lighting retrofits, and re-commissioning of utilities in older buildings.
o	Design or renovation of 16 projects on campus that meet requirements for the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) designation, the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance energy-efficient green buildings. More information about sustainable building at Vanderbilt can be found on Campus Planning and Construction’s Sustainable Building page or the SustainVU Green Building page.
o	Reduction of fuel used by Vanderbilt’s fleet of vehicles by conversion to electric-powered vehicles and size reduction. Installation of 15 new electric car charging stations on VU campus.
o	Four projects involving solar generation: a partnership with TVA to install solar-powered electric car charging stations, an array of solar thin films at the power house as a part of the first Green Fund Project, installation of four solar-powered electronics charging stations throughout campus as part of a Green Fund Project, and the installation of a 120gallon solar hot water heating system on the Currey Tennis Center as part of a Green Fund Project.
o	Significant renovations and retrofits to many campus buildings including lighting retrofits, updates to Building Automation Systems and heating/cooling systems.

•	Western Foundation Creates Climate-Friendly Fund – September 2014
After requests by the student body to divest from fossil fuels, the Western Foundation decided to keep current investments in fossil fuel stocks, citing potential inconsistency within the mission of the Foundation. The WWU Foundation Governing Board Divestment Study Committee concluded that divestment could damage foundation funds including scholarship and faculty support. The Board recommended that a climate-friendly fund be created as an option for future donors.

•	Energy Retrofits – December 2014
Facilities Management recently completed two energy saving projects through PSE’s conservation rebate program. The first project upgraded and optimized heating, ventilation, and air conditioning controls in the Academic Instruction Center, Communications Facility (shown below), Haggard Hall, Humanities, and Science Lecture. The project cost $254,000, resulted in $246,000 in rebates, and has verified utility savings of $45,000 annually, with a $10,000 increase in annual maintenance costs. The programming within Western’s Siemens Building Automation Control system was designed to be replicated in other buildings on campus. A second project replaced 22 high pressure sodium (HPS) exterior lights with LED units. The project will achieve approximately $900 annually in savings and has a pay back of four years. The upgrade also achieved higher quality garage and area lighting for better visual acuity and security.

•	Campus-Wide Energy and Water Conservation Retrofit Project
In support of the Western Climate Action Plan, construction is nearly complete on a $3.2 million utility conservation project that spanned 28 campus buildings and is projected to drive down utility use by 4.5%. 

•	2° Turndown
Facilities Management and the Office of Sustainability teamed up on a project to reduce utility costs by reducing building heating hours, setting thermostats to 68°, and providing tools for occupant comfort buildings. This project saved an estimated $68,000 in natural gas and electricity costs over winter 2012, despite a 40% drop in natural gas commodity prices. 

•	Revolving Energy Fund
In 2012, the Office of Sustainability and Facilities Management have proposed this strategy for funding critical campus conservation projects. Savings from qualifying projects are placed into this fund which is then used to pay for future conservation efforts. Western follows the University of Vermont, Oregon State University, and 39 other institutions nationally in the creation of such an account. National investment in such funds totals over $75 million, with a goal of $1 billion.

•	Miller Hall Remodel
The LEED-Gold rating was given by the U.S. Green Building Council in 2012 for the renovation of historic Miller Hall, Western’s highest LEED rating to date.
