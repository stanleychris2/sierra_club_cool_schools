Master's students are required to submit their thesis online to BEARdocs; submission to UMI/ProQuest is optional.  More information about this process can be found here. 

For BEARdocs, students are allowed to request that the full-text of their work not be made available to the public (also called an embargo) for two years (generally in anticipation of journal article publication) or for five years (generally in anticipation of a patent or a book).  Students must indicate that they want this hold using this form.  After the initial embargo period, the hold can be extended.  If you wish to extend the embargo, you must contact librarywebmaster@baylor.edu.

For UMI/ProQuest, you must fill out a separate Author Authorization form during the submission process.  UMI/ProQuest explains their embargo process here.  In addition to deciding about whether to embargo your full-text content, you need to decide whether to allow third-party retailers to access your content through UMI/ProQuest and publish/sell your work.  Read this page for more information about third-party discovery and access. In general, you probably want to promote discovery but limit the sale of your work via this UMI/ProQuest third-party retailer option.

You retain the copyright to your work with your submission to BEARdocs and UMI/ProQuest.  Under current US copyright law, the copyright for your work is automatically assigned to you, the creator.  You can choose to file formally for copyright by filing with the Copyright Office.  You can do this yourself or pay UMI/ProQuest or another party to file for you.  The 2 main advantages of filing for the copyright come into play if you are infringed and go to court.  In that case,  filing copryght:

Provides the highest level of legal (prima facie) evidence that you own the copyright; and

Preamble

Columbia University is a community of scholars committed to disseminating and sharing the intellectual fruits of their research and scholarship. At Columbia University, the scholarly community includes Officers of the University (comprising officers of instruction, research, administration, and the library) and other professional staff members. In recognition of their commitment to Columbia’s research mission, the officers and professional staff within the endorsing units of Columbia University are determined to take advantage of available technologies that can enhance accessibility of Columbia scholarship by colleagues and other researchers, educators, policymakers, and interested readers worldwide; to employ technologies that can preserve copies of their works for future study; and to provide full-text online discoverability of their scholarly works. The officers and professional staff members also desire to join the efforts of many of Columbia’s peer institutions in support of public access; in the process they seek to coordinate Columbia’s initiatives with customary practices and legal obligations associated with many scholarly works. In furtherance of these objectives and opportunities, the endorsing parties hereby resolve:

Resolved:

Each officer and other professional staff member within CUL/IS hereby commits to make his or her scholarly journal articles accessible to the public through a digital repository based at Columbia University or through an appropriate alternative open-access repository.

Implementation of this Resolution

Each officer or other professional staff member who is the author or co-author of a work of scholarship (see the scope of works as defined below) shall submit to the digital repository based at Columbia University (the current repository is known as Academic Commons), a copy of such work, together with any bibliographic or citation information. The author hereby grants to The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to all such works of scholarship, created after the adoption of this resolution, solely for the purpose of providing and maintaining public access to them. This resolution does not alter copyright ownership rights determined in accordance with law or the Columbia University Copyright Policy. Many scholars based at Columbia University currently make some or all of their works available through other publicly accessible repositories such as arXiv or PubMed Central. In lieu of submission of a work to Academic Commons, an author may satisfy the terms of this resolution by making such work available through an alternative repository of the author’s choosing, provided that such repository makes the work accessible in full-text to the public, without costs or other restrictions (other than customary embargoes) imposed on any individual user, and that it offers to preserve and maintain access to the work indefinitely.

Scope of Works of Scholarship

This resolution applies to scholarly journal articles that meet the following criteria:

The work is authored or co-authored by an officer or professional staff member while employed at Columbia University;
The work is not subject to an incompatible publication agreement, license, or assignment entered into before the adoption of this resolution;
and The work is in a digital format and of a type that may be included in Academic Commons or other repository consistent with its policies and practices.
The version of the work that may be deposited may depend on the exact terms of that author’s agreement with the journal publisher. If not otherwise specified in the agreement for publication, the version shall be the author’s final version, which would ordinarily be the version after the article has gone through peer review and any revisions responsive thereto and any further copyediting in which the author has participated. Although the commitment in this resolution applies only to scholarly journal articles, members of the university community are encouraged to consider making all forms of scholarly works, including articles, essays, datasets, books, conference papers, reports, presentation slides, and audiovisual works, available through the appropriate repository.

Waivers and Relationship to Publication Agreements

This resolution is not intended to interfere in any way with an author’s plans to pursue publication of the work or patent rights associated with the work. However, publication of a work is often subject to an agreement between the author and publisher, and such agreement may include provisions that support access or that are incompatible with this resolution.  Authors should carefully review their publication agreements. Most situations will be one of the following:

The author entered into an agreement for publication before adoption of this resolution: This resolution does not apply to such work. The author may voluntarily contribute it to the repository as the agreement may permit.
The author has deposited the work with the repository, and later considers entering into a publication agreement:  This resolution is a nonexclusive license to the University and does not prevent the author from making other uses of the work. The author should inform the prospective publisher of the prior license and include language (see suggestion below) in the publication agreement that may resolve any conflict.
The author is considering entering into a publication agreement and has not yet deposited the work or a version of it with the repository: This resolution is a commitment by the author to submit the scholarly work to the repository. The author is therefore asked to review the publication agreement carefully and to include language (see suggestions below) in the agreement that may resolve any conflict.
The University, through the Copyright Advisory Office, or Office of General Counsel, or other office, will provide guidance to assist authors who are negotiating and adding language to publication agreements. However, most possible conflicts suggested in the foregoing situations may be resolved by adding to the agreement a statement such as: “Notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, the publisher understands and accepts that the article or other publication is subject to the Open Access Commitment of Columbia University.”

If accessibility of a work pursuant to this resolution is ultimately incompatible with the author’s plans for publication, or with the publisher’s contractual obligations, the author may request in writing a waiver or postponement of obligations under this resolution, and such request shall be granted. Columbia University shall implement a means for receiving and fulfilling such requests for waivers or postponements.

Administration of the Resolution

The Dean, Director, Chair, or other head of any unit at Columbia that has adopted this resolution shall be responsible for resolving questions arising within the unit concerning the interpretation and application of the resolution. The Vice President for Information Services and University Librarian shall be responsible for implementing procedures and resolving questions regarding the administration of the University’s repository. Each of these persons may act through a designated delegate""

In March 2010, the Duke University Academic Council adopted an open access policy that applies to all Duke faculty members and, unless individual authors choose to opt-out, provides Duke a license to make scholarly articles authored by Duke faculty freely available via a Duke University Libraries repository known as DukeSpace. The text of the policy is found in Appendix P of the Faculty Handbook. If a publisher requests a formal letter waiving the faculty open access policy (i.e., asking to opt out), that can be accommodated.

In 2010, Duke joined the Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity (COPE) and established a fund to help Duke researchers cover author fees and to remove the financial barriers to publishing in OA journals.",,"Policy on Open Access to Research
Adopted by Academic Council, 18 March 2010
http://provost.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/FHB_App_P.pdf

The Faculty of Duke University is committed to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In addition to the public benefit of such dissemination, this policy is intended to serve faculty interests by promoting greater reach and impact for articles, simplifying authors’ retention of distribution rights, and aiding preservation. In keeping with these commitments, the Faculty adopts the following policy.

Each Faculty member grants to Duke University permission to make available his or her scholarly articles and to reproduce and distribute those articles for the purpose of open dissemination. In legal terms, each Faculty member grants to Duke University a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, and to authorize others to do so, provided that the articles are not sold. The Duke faculty author remains the copyright owner unless that author chooses to transfer the copyright to a publisher.

The policy will apply to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a member of the Faculty except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost's designate will waive application of the license for a particular article or delay access for a specified period of time upon written request by a Faculty member.

To assist the University in distributing the scholarly articles, each faculty member will make available, as of the date of publication or upon request, an electronic copy of the final author’s version of the article at no charge to a designated representative of the Provost’s Office in an appropriate format (such as PDF) specified by the Provost's Office. The Provost's Office will make the article available to the public in Duke’s open-access repository. In cases where the Duke license has been waived or an embargo period has been mutually agreed, the article may be archived in a Duke repository without open access for the period of the embargo, or permanently in cases of waiver.

The Office of the Provost, in consultation with the Executive Committee of the Academic Council, will be responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the Faculty from time to time.

The Faculty calls upon the Library Council and Duke University Libraries to develop and monitor a plan for a service or mechanism that would render compliance with the policy as convenient for the faculty as possible.

The policy and service model will be reviewed after three years and a report presented
to the Faculty.

For more information on the implementation of this policy, see http://library.duke.edu/openaccess/ or contact Kevin Smith <kevin.l.smith@duke.edu>, Scholarly Communications Officer at Duke University Libraries.
",http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/2841,"At Duke, one of the signature themes of our mission is putting knowledge in the service of society. This means making the fruits of Duke research available as broadly as possible — not just to researchers at places like Duke that have subscription access to scholarly literature via their libraries but to anyone who might benefit from the scholarship being done here. Duke University and Duke University Libraries support open access through a number of initiatives and encourages Duke scholars to work toward making their research openly accessible.

Duke University Libraries hosts a repository called DukeSpace. The DukeSpace repository hosts articles made available under the open access policy, as well as other scholarly resources from Duke. The Duke University Graduate School requires all students to submit their theses and dissertations electronically. All submissions are accessible in the DukeSpace repository under a Creative Commons license. 

The Duke Medical Center Library & Archives also supports open access to health and medical information.

Open Access Journal Publishing: Duke University Libraries can help researchers create a peer-reviewed online journal or transition an existing one to an open access online version by providing a platform and technical support. We currently support several journals using the Open Journal Systems platform.

Open Access at Duke Law: In 1998, the Duke University School of Law became the first in the country to make all the articles published in its law journals — including back issues — freely accessible online. The Duke Law Scholarship Repository continues to provide free, full-text access to more than 3,000 scholarly articles written by Duke Law faculty or published in Duke Law journals.",http://library.duke.edu/research/openaccess,"This information is from fiscal year 2014 reporting.

Such exceptions must be within guidelines approved by the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Educational Policies Committee of the University Faculty Council.

Access Policy

There are two levels of access for works deposited in Loyola eCommons:

    Open-access: The work may be publicly viewed by anyone, regardless of institutional affiliation.
    Loyola-only: The work may only be viewed by current students, faculty, and staff of Loyola University Chicago or persons using a workstation on-campus.

Loyola eCommons encourages contributors to make their works available for open access whenever possible. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to restrict access to the Loyola community (for example, due to a prior agreement with a publisher).

In some cases, contributors may request that their items be restricted to Loyola-only access for a defined ""embargo"" period, after which they will be made available as open-access. For more information on this option, please contact us.

Use Policy

Licensed under a Creative Commons ""Attribution / Non-commercial / No derivative works"" agreement, works deposited in Loyola eCommons are freely available for online viewing, printing and download for the purposes of non-commercial research or private study only. Users may make or use personal copies in print or electronic format as permitted under statutory provisions of copyright law as amended, provided that:

    The author(s), title and full bibliographic details of the item are cited clearly when any part of the work is referred to verbally or in the written form
    A hyperlink/URL to the original Loyola eCommons record for the item is included in any citation of the work
    The content is not changed in any way
    All files required for usage of the item are kept together with the main item file

You may not:

    Sell the whole or any part of an item
    Refer to any part of an item without a citation
    Amend any item or contextualize it in a way that will impugn the contributor's reputation
    Remove or alter the copyright statement on an item

Failure to comply with this policy may result in the infringement of the author's intellectual property rights in the work.

Withdrawal

In general, once submissions have been approved and posted in Loyola eCommons, they cannot be removed, as they constitute a permanent record of the academic output of the Loyola University Chicago community.

However, the University Libraries acknowledge that there may be instances when it may be necessary to remove items from the repository in several cases:

    The appearance of the item in the collection violates a previous copyright agreement, such as an agreement between and author and a journal publisher
    Permission to deposit the material has not been properly obtained from the copyright holder(s)
    The contributor(s) has failed to comply with the policies and procedures mandated by the Office of Research, especially in regards to safety regulations, use of human subjects, and intellectual property
    The item may contribute to cheating or unfair advantage in academic work (such as tests still in use, answers to problem sets, etc.)
    The item has been determined to contain false or libelous claims toward another individual or group

Works may not be withdrawn when a depositor leaves Loyola University Chicago. (The non-exclusive license agreement preserves the depositor's right to submit additional copies elsewhere.)

A withdrawal request may be initiated by the depositor or, in the case of a copyright violation, an internal or external entity. Requests for removal should be directed to ecommons [at] luc.edu and should include the item title, URL, and reasons for withdrawal.

After reviewing the request, Loyola eCommons staff will contact the requestor to let them know a work has been withdrawn, or, if withdrawal is not appropriate, to let the requestor know the reason(s) withdrawal was not completed.

If a withdrawal is requested due to an alleged copyright violation, Loyola eCommons staff will also notify the depositor. If it is found that copyright was not violated, access to the withdrawn item will be reinstated. Loyola eCommons and the University Libraries are not responsible for resolving copyright disputes.

Under the policy, faculty authors give MIT nonexclusive permission to disseminate their journal articles for open access through DSpace (http://dspace.mit.edu/), an open-source software platform developed by the MIT Libraries and Hewlett Packard and launched in 2002. The policy gives MIT and its faculty the right to use and share the articles for any purpose other than to make a profit. Authors may opt out on a paper-by-paper basis.

In legal terms, each Faculty member grants to MIT a nonexclusive, irrevocable, paid-up, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and to authorize others to do the same. The policy will apply to all scholarly articles written while the person is a member of the Faculty except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost’s designate will waive application of the policy for a particular article upon written notification by the author, who informs MIT of the reason.

The content is preserved, given a permanent link, and made searchable and accessible to users everywhere. The content submitted need not be limited to print – video or audio recordings are welcomed alongside traditional print-based materials",,"McMaster follows the open access policy guidelines of the major Canadian Public Research Councils, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and Canadian Insitute of Health Research (CIHR) which are looking to implement Open Access Policy requiring all federally funded peer-reviewed journal articles to be made freely available within one year of initial publication.

The details below are from the government of Canada Website. 

1. Preamble

As a publicly funded organization, CIHR has a fundamental interest in ensuring that the findings that result from the research it funds, including research publications and publication-related data, are available to the widest possible audience, and at the earliest possible opportunity. Advancements in science and health care are made possible through widespread and barrier-free access to cutting-edge research and knowledge enabling scientists, clinicians, policy makers and the public to use and build on this knowledge.

The advent of the internet has transformed the way that science and scholarly research is communicated. Indicative of this changing landscape has been the steady growth in open access publishing and archiving which facilitate widespread diffusion and free digital access to publications and the latest scientific discoveries. Open access enables researchers to make their research results freely accessible and use able for the international research community thereby enhancing the application of research results. CIHR strongly supports unrestricted open access, which promotes the principle of scientific openness, an essential element of science. The importance of open access has been recognized by other research funding agencies, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health, U.K. Medical Research Council, The Wellcome Trust, and the Australian Research Council.
2. Policy Objective

The objective of this policy is to improve open access of research funded by CIHR, and to increase the diffusion of research results.
3. Guiding Principles

Following from CIHR's core values and its commitment to the highest scientific and ethical standards, the following principles guide CIHR in promoting open access to research outputs:

    Committing to academic freedom, and the right to publish;
    Maintaining the high standards and quality of research by committing to scientific openness, integrity and ethics;
    Promoting recognized research best practices and standards across disciplines, and embracing and sharing emerging practices and standards;
    Advancing science and innovation;
    Effective diffusion of research results; and
    Aligning activities, programs and policies between Canadian and international research funding agencies.

4. Application

This policy applies to all grants awarded January 1, 2008 and onward, which have received funding in whole or in part from CIHR. While not required, researchers holding grants that were awarded prior to January 1, 2008 are encouraged to adhere to the requirements of this policy.
5. Policy Statement
5.1 Guidance on Open Access to Research Outputs

    Research outputs are conceptual or practical knowledge, data, information, and physical or biological materials developed during the course of a research project that are integral for building on research discoveries. CIHR recognizes three categories of research outputs: peer-reviewed journal publications, research materials, and research data.
    For now, CIHR has decided to limit this policy to peer-reviewed journal publications and publication-related biomedical research data, which is typically deposited into public databases as a condition of publication. CIHR is committed to improving open access to research outputs and will explore broadening the policy to include research materials and other research data in the future.
    Researchers, research ethics boards, institutions and all those involved in research involving human subjects, are responsible for respecting the rights and reasonable expectations of individuals, groups or communities, with regard to protection of their privacy and of the confidentiality of their information obtained for research purposes. This policy should be read in conjunction with applicable privacy legislation and policies in the jurisdiction(s) where the research is being or has been conducted, as well as with the Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS 2), Guidelines for Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research, the Food and Drugs Act, and of the Food and Drug Regulations.

5.1.1 Peer-reviewed Journal Publications

    Grant recipients are required to ensure that their peer-reviewed publications are freely accessible through the Publisher's website (Option #1) or an online repository (Option #2) within 12 months of publication.
    Under the second option, grant recipients must archive the final peer-reviewed full-text manuscripts immediately upon publication in a digital archive, such as PubMed Central Canada or the grantees’ institutional repository. Publications must be freely accessible within 12 months of publication. It is the responsibility of the grant recipient to determine which journals allow authors to retain copyright and/or allow authors to archive journal publications in accordance with funding agency policies. Grant recipients may also wish to submit their manuscripts to a journal that provides immediate open access to published articles (if a suitable journal exists). CIHR considers the cost of publishing in open access journals to be an eligible expense under the Use of Grant Funds.
    Book chapters, reports, monographs, editorials, or conference proceedings arising from CIHR-funded research are not currently covered under this policy.
    Grant recipients must acknowledge CIHR contributions in all peer-reviewed publications, quoting the funding reference number.

5.1.2 Publication-related Research Data

    Recognizing that access to research data promotes the advancement of science and further high-quality and ethical investigation, CIHR explored current best practices and standards related to the deposition of publication-related data in openly accessible databases. As a first step, CIHR will now require grant recipients to deposit bioinformatics, atomic, and molecular coordinate data into the appropriate public database, as already required by most journals, immediately upon publication of research results (e.g., deposition of nucleic acid sequences into GenBank). Please refer to the Annex for examples of research outputs and the corresponding publicly accessible repository or database.
    CIHR now requires grant recipients to retain original data sets arising from CIHR-funded research for a minimum of five years after the end of the grant. This applies to all data, whether published or not. The grant recipient's institution and research ethics board may have additional policies and practices regarding the preservation, retention, and protection of research data that must be respected.

6. Monitoring and Adherence

    Grant recipients are reminded that by accepting CIHR funds they have accepted the terms and conditions of the grant or award as set out in the Agency's policies and guidelines.1 In the event of an alleged breach of CIHR funding policy, CIHR may take steps outlined in accordance with the Tri-Agency Framework: Responsible Conduct of Research to deal with the allegation.2

7. Policy Review

    CIHR will review and update this policy on an annual basis or as needed.

PDXScholar is also a platform for sharing primary materials curated by Portland State University Special Collections and University Archives.

This document outlines policies and guidelines regarding the submission of content to PDXScholar, including submission criteria, author and user rights, and procedures for removing posted content.

Mission
PDXScholar provides free open access to Portland State University scholarship. PDXScholar brings together the varied and diverse Portland State University scholarly output in one digital space, enabling the University to effectively promote the ideas produced by Portland State University scholars for the benefit of prospective students, current students, prospective faculty, current faculty, alumni, and others.

The Collection
Currently, PDXScholar includes research and scholarship produced by faculty, schools, departments, institutes, center, student groups and programs at Portland State University. In addition, PDXScholar recognizes academic excellence by highlighting the work of graduate and undergraduate students at the University.

Collection development priorities include:

original student research
faculty scholarship, including gray literature (unpublished or in-process manuscripts), previously-published articles from scholarly journals, chapters in books, conference papers and select presentations
Portland State University institutional documents, such as conference proceedings, programs and other ephemera
high-quality, peer-reviewed journals edited by Portland State University faculty and students
Author/Creator Rights
Authors who submit their content to PDXScholar retain the copyright to their work, unless they have explicitly signed it away in a copyright transfer agreement with a third party. The Library asks authors to grant a non-exclusive distribution license (license can be found as appendix), which allows the Library to distribute the work through the repository.

When submitting material to PDXScholar content owners will have the option to set conditions on the re-use of their materials by affixing a permission and copyright license statement, such as a Creative Commons License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/), to their work.

A user who shares copyrighted materials with other members of the Portland State University community or the general public affirms that s/he either owns the copyright to the published object or has obtained permission from the copyright owner to publish the material.

Approved by the Faculty Senate, April 18, 2012
Motion to approve an Open Access Policy, as follows:
The Faculty of Rice University is committed to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In keeping with that commitment, and recognizing the importance of letting faculty members choose appropriate venues of publications for their scholarly work, the Faculty adopts the following policy: The current Rice copyright policy governing faculty publications will be followed, with the additional provision that Rice University will make published articles written by faculty members available for open dissemination. The policy will apply to all scholarly articles written while the person is a faculty member, except for publications completed before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost’s designate will waive application of the policy for a particular scholarly publication upon written notification by the author, who informs Rice of the reason. Faculty members are further encouraged to make all of their publications, not just articles, available for open dissemination.
To assist Rice in distributing the scholarly articles, as of the date of publication, each faculty member will make available an electronic copy of his or her final version of the publication at no charge to a designated representative of the Provost’s Office in one of the appropriate formats specified by the Provost’s Office. The Provost’s Office will make the articles available to the public in an open-access repository, the Rice Digital Scholarship Archive. Upon request, an article will not be made available to the public for an agreed-upon embargo period.
The Office of the Provost, in consultation with the Vice Provost and University Librarian, will be responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the Faculty. The Library Committee will provide ongoing faculty oversight, advising the Office of the Provost and reporting annually to the Senate.
The policy is to take effect immediately; it will be reviewed after three years, with a report presented to the Faculty. The Faculty calls upon the Vice Provost and University Librarian to develop and monitor a plan for a service or mechanism that would render compliance with the policy as convenient for the Faculty as possible.",http://scholarship.rice.edu/ ,"With the open access policy newly in place, Fondren Library is working with faculty to help them comply with the requirements.  Learning from other institutions whose faculties have adopted an open access policy, Fondren realizes that support is necessary in order to get publications into the repository.  Significant groundwork is being laid to heighten awareness of the policy and to explain open access. First and foremost, the library is placing an emphasis on marketing, because both the policy and the repository itself are new to the majority of faculty. Assisting faculty with article deposits, providing support for navigating copyright issues, working with publishers to make them aware of the new policy and developing a mechanism for requesting a waiver when compliance becomes impossible are all services that the library provides to faculty, staff and students involved in research.

EXCERPT FROM STANFORD'S POLICY ON OPENNESS IN RESEARCH:

The rules adopted by the Academic Council on September 29, 1967, are hereby amended and, as amended, are reaffirmed:

(1) No research on a thesis or dissertation should be undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is any substantial possibility that it will lead to a secret thesis or dissertation.

(2) No secret thesis or dissertation should be accepted as the basis for a degree unless, in the judgment of the Committee on Graduate Studies, the imposition of secrecy could not reasonably have been foreseen until the work was so far advanced that modification of the thesis topic would have resulted in substantial inequity to the student.

(3) Scholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny by the entire Advisory Board should not be considered in connection with appointments, reappointments or promotions.

(4) The University should enter no contract and accept no grant to carry out research if the grant or contract restrains the freedom of the University to disclose the:

(4A)Existence of the contract or grant or,

(4B) General nature of the inquiry to be conducted or,

(4C) Identity of the outside contracting or granting entity or,

(4D) The research results;

provided that this clause shall not apply either (a) to anonymous gifts or grants that do not call for the performance of specified lines of inquiry, or (b) to research grants or contracts from individuals or non-governmental entities who request anonymity out of a justifiable motivation to protect individual privacy.

Preamble
The Faculty of the University of California is committed to disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In particular, as part of a public university system, the Faculty is dedicated to making its scholarship available to the people of California and the world. Furthermore, the Faculty recognizes the benefits that accrue to themselves as individual scholars and to the scholarly enterprise from such wide dissemination, including greater recognition, more thorough review, consideration and critique, and a general increase in scientific, scholarly and critical knowledge. Faculty further recognize that by this policy, and with the assistance of the University, they can more easily and collectively reserve rights that might otherwise be signed away, often 24/2013.
Grant of License and Limitations

Each Faculty member grants to the University of California a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, and to authorize others to do the same, for the purpose of making their articles widely and freely available in an open access repository. Any other systematic uses of the licensed articles by the University of California must be approved by the Academic Senate. This policy does not transfer copyright ownership, which remains with Faculty authors under existing University of California policy.

Scope and Waiver (Opt-Out)

The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a member of the Faculty except for any articles published before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. Upon express direction by a Faculty member, the University of California will waive the license for a particular article or delay access to the article for a specified period of time.

Deposit of Articles

To assist the University in disseminating and archiving the articles, Faculty commit to helping the University obtain copies of the articles. Specifically, each Faculty member who does not permanently waive the license above will provide an electronic copy of his or her final version of the article to the University of California by the date of its publication, for inclusion in an open access repository. When appropriate, a Faculty member may instead notify the University of California if the article will be freely available in another repository or as an open-access publication. Faculty members who have permanently waived the license may nonetheless deposit a copy with the University of California or elsewhere for archival purposes.

Notwithstanding the above, this policy does not in any way prescribe or limit the venue of publication. This policy neither requires nor prohibits the payment of fees or publication costs by authors.

Oversight of Policy

The Academic Senate and the University of California will be jointly responsible for implementing this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending any changes to the Faculty. Any changes to the text of this policy will require approval by both the Academic Senate and the University of California. The Academic Senate and the University of California will review the policy within three years, and present a report to the Faculty and the University of California.

The Faculty calls upon the Academic Senate and the University of California to develop and monitor mechanisms that would render implementation and compliance with the policy as convenient for the Faculty as possible.

UC Presidential Open Access Policy
Issued October 23, 2015
I. Policy Summary
The University of California is committed to disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In particular, as a public university system, the University of California is dedicated to making its scholarship available to the people of California. Furthermore, the University of California recognizes the benefits that accrue to its authors as individual scholars and to the scholarly enterprise from such wide dissemination, including greater recognition, more thorough review, consideration, and critique, and a general increase in scientific, scholarly, and critical knowledge. The University of California further recognizes that by such policies, authors of scholarly articles can more easily and collectively reserve rights that might otherwise be signed away, often unnecessarily, in agreements with publishers. To accomplish this, authors take advantage of US copyright law to grant to the University a non-exclusive license (limited to the purpose of making the work openly available) for each scholarly article authored while employed by UC. The Academic Senate has already taken this step for all of its members by adopting an open access policy on July 24, 2013.
The policy in this document extends the same opportunity to all non-Senate members of the University of California community who author scholarly articles (defined herein as “University Authors”). The policy allows non-Senate authors of scholarly articles to maintain legal control over their research articles while making their work freely and widely available to the public. To achieve this, the policy commits University Authors to deposit a version of each scholarly article in a digital repository. The deposited work will be made freely and openly available to the public, unless the author obtains a waiver. The policy also takes the extra step of defining procedures that implement this policy uniformly for all University of California employees, including all Academic Senate members. Finally, it outlines procedures that should be followed if the Academic Senate changes its policy in ways that affect the congruence of the Senate policy with this Presidential policy.
II. Definitions
Academic Senate Authors: Authors of scholarly articles who are members of the systemwide Academic Senate. For a list of titles conferring membership in the Academic Senate, see Regents Standing Order 105.1 and the Academic Personnel Manual, Section 110-4(4) (APM – 110-4, Academic Personnel Definitions).
Copyright: Rights as defined by US Copyright Law (Title 17 of the United States Code), and further specified by the 1992 University of California Policy on Copyright Ownership or any amendments to that policy, or its successor, see http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2100003/CopyrightOwnership.
Embargo/Delay of Access: The amount of time before a scholarly article will be made available after it is accepted by a publisher. Under this policy, authors may specify an embargo of any length, or honor a publisher’s request for one.
Employees: All faculty, academic appointees (includes academic administrative officers, Cooperative Extension and University Extension appointees, librarians, residents, interns, and postdoctoral scholars), students who are employed by UC, staff, and administrators who are paid a salary, stipend, or hourly rate, excluding those holding “Without Salary” appointments, volunteers, and recalls.
Executive Officers: The President of the University of California, the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Chancellors of the UC campuses, the Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Vice President of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
Final Version: An author’s final revised version of a scholarly article, generally post-peer reviewed, but not necessarily the typeset publisher’s copy, unless allowed by the publisher.
License or Copyright License: A grant of rights made in accordance with Copyright Law (USC Title 17), allowing specified uses of a copyrighted work.
Open Access: The free availability of scholarly literature on the public internet, permitting users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of articles for any lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet.
Open Access Repository: Any digital archive or platform designed to make articles freely available via the internet with clearly defined legal restrictions on their use or circulation. The California Digital Library’s eScholarship platform is the default repository for this policy.
Scholarly Articles: Published research articles in the broadest sense of the term. A narrower term could have the effect of excluding works published in a certain format, discipline or practice. For example, the term “scholarly journal articles” might exclude those who publish in edited volumes; the term “peer-reviewed scholarly articles” might exclude law reviews which are reviewed by students or by editorial collectives.
Student: An individual for whom the University maintains student records and who: (a) is enrolled in or registered with an academic program of the University; (b) has completed the immediately preceding term, is not presently enrolled, and is eligible for re-enrollment; or (c) is on an approved educational leave or other approved leave status, or is on filing-fee status. This definition applies to undergraduate, transfer, graduate academic, and graduate professional students.
University of California: The “University of California” refers to The Regents of the University of California.
University Authors: Non-Senate employees and students of the University of California who author scholarly articles while employed by the University of California. University Authors are covered by this policy whether or not they own the copyright in an article, in accordance with the 1992 University of California Policy on Copyright Ownership or any amendments to that policy, or its successor, 
see http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2100003/CopyrightOwnership.
Waive/Opt out: To waive or opt out, means to decline to grant the University the license described in section III.B.1 below. A waiver can be obtained from the University of California’s Office of Scholarly Communication website, 
see http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/waiver-embargo-addendum/.
III. Policy Text
This policy does not apply to any members of the Academic Senate, who are covered by the Open Access Policy passed by the Academic Senate of the University of California on July 24, 2013, see http://uc-oa.info/policy-text/systemwide-senate/. Procedures to be followed if the Academic Senate changes its policy are outlined in Section IV.D. below.
A. General
This Open Access Policy allows University Authors (see Section II for definition of University Authors) to maintain legal control over their research articles while making their work freely and widely available to the public. The policy does not require University Authors to publish in open access journals, or to pay fees or charges to publish; it commits the University and University Authors to deposit a version of each article in a digital repository. The deposited work will be made freely and openly available to the public, unless the author obtains a waiver.
This policy covers two classes of University Authors:
Section III.B. covers University Authors who do own the copyright to their works, as specified in the 1992 UC Copyright Policy or its successor. University Authors who own the copyright to their works may waive the license in B.1 below, or request an embargo as specified in sections V.B. and V.C. below.
Section III.C. covers University Authors who do not own the copyright to their works, as specified in the 1992 UC Copyright Policy or its successor. University Authors who do not own the copyright to their works may not waive the license in B.1 below, but may request an embargo as specified in V.C below.
B. University Authors Who Own the Copyright to their Scholarly Works
1. Grant of License and Limitations
Each University Author grants to the Regents of the University of California a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, and to authorize others to do the same, for the purpose of making their articles widely and freely available in an open access repository. This policy does not transfer copyright ownership, which remains with University Authors under existing University of California policy.
2. Scope and Waiver (Opt-Out)
This policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is an employee of the University of California except for any articles published before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which a University Author entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. Upon express direction by a University Author, application of the license will be waived for a particular article or access to the article will be delayed for a specified period of time.
3. Deposit of Articles
To assist the University in disseminating and archiving the articles, University Authors are expected to help the University obtain copies of the articles. Specifically, each author will provide an electronic copy of his or her final version of the article to the University of California by the date of its publication for inclusion in an open access repository. When appropriate, a University Author may instead notify the University of California if the article will be freely available in another repository or as an open access publication.
Notwithstanding the above, this policy does not in any way prescribe or limit the venue of publication. Notwithstanding the above, this policy does not in any way prescribe or limit the venue of publication. This policy neither requires nor prohibits the payment of fees or publication costs by authors.
C. University Authors Who Do Not Own Copyright in their Scholarly Works
The University recognizes that members of the University community who do not own their copyrights under the 1992 University of California Policy on Copyright Ownership may also be authors of scholarly articles. In these cases, the University will promote open access in accordance with Section B above. Specifically, the University will retain the right to make such articles available in an open access repository. Upon request by the author, the University will grant an embargo period, as described in Section V.C. below. Upon a showing of compelling circumstances, the University may grant a waiver, as described in Section V.B. below. These authors must also deposit a copy of the final version of each article for inclusion in an open access repository, as described in Section B.3 above and Section V.A. below.
IV. Compliance/Responsibilities
A. Authority
The Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs is the Responsible Officer for this policy and has the authority to implement the policy and to develop procedures or other supplementary information to support implementation. S/he will work with the California Digital Library (CDL), which has responsibility for 1) coordinating, with the locations, systemwide processes for deposit; and 2) managing software for harvesting, waivers, embargoes, and deposits. As the Provost’s designee, the Vice Provost for Academic Personnel and Programs has responsibility to manage issues of policy interpretation, in consultation with stakeholders.
The Executive Officer at each location is authorized to establish, and is responsible for, local communication about the policy using existing committees, councils, and mechanisms.
B. Revisions to the Policy
The President has the authority to approve revisions to this policy upon recommendation by the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.
The Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs has the authority to initiate a review of the efficacy of this policy and to initiate revisions to this policy.
C. Compliance with the Policy
As the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs’ designee, the Vice Provost for Academic Personnel and Programs is responsible for the administration of this policy. S/he will work with the California Digital Library (CDL), UC Libraries and the Office of Scholarly Communication to obtain data or other information to inform assessment of the policy.
The Executive Officer at each location will designate an office or individual to assess policy use and compliance. The Executive Officer is accountable for ensuring that local communication and interpretation are consistent with this policy.
D. Coordination with the Academic Senate Open Access Policy
The Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs has the authority to determine the process to be followed in the event that the Academic Senate updates or changes its open access policy (adopted July 24, 2013) in ways that affect the congruence of the Senate policy with the Presidential policy.
V. Procedures
In support of this policy and of the Open Access Policy adopted by the Academic Senate on July 24, 2013, the following procedures will be implemented to allow all authors (Senate, Non-Senate or otherwise) of scholarly articles at the University of California to make their works openly available.
A. Deposit a Scholarly Article in the UC Open Access Repository
All Academic Senate authors and all University Authors may make a final version of their articles publicly and freely available by depositing them in the University of California’s “eScholarship” digital repository via http://uc-oa.info/deposit/.
This policy commits all University Authors to deposit a final version of their articles in the UC eScholarship digital repository or another open access repository by the date of publication, to the extent practicable, even if they choose to waive the license grant to the University. Academic Senate authors will be encouraged to deposit articles in the UC eScholarship digital repository even if they choose to waive the license grant to the University. If any University Author or Academic Senate author specifies an embargo (section V.C. below), the author may deposit the article either by the date of publication or by the date the embargo period expires.
B. Generate a Waiver
By their own choosing or upon request from a publisher, all Academic Senate authors and University Authors who own their copyright to a given article may waive the grant of license to the University described in section III.B.1 above. To do so, an author simply has to generate a waiver at the University of California’s Office of Scholarly Communication website (http://uc-oa.info/waiver-embargo-addendum/).
C. Specify an Embargo Period
By their own choosing or upon request from a publisher, all Academic Senate authors and University Authors may delay the date of appearance of their articles (“embargo” the article). To do so, an author simply has to specify the embargo period (usually six or twelve months) at the Office of Scholarly Communication website (http://uc-oa.info/waiver-embargo-addendum) or during the deposit process.
D. Choose a License
At the time of deposit, all Academic Senate authors and University Authors may choose whether to share their work under one of the available Creative Commons licenses, some of which allow commercial reuse and some of which do not (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/).
E. Obtain an Addendum
Although not necessary, all Academic Senate authors and University Authors may request an Addendum for each article to be provided to publishers at the time of signing their author agreement. The Addendum notifies the publisher that the article is subject to either the Presidential Open Access Policy or the Academic Senate Open Access Policy. Addenda can be requested at UC’s Office of Scholarly Communication website, seehttp://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/waiver-embargo-addendum/

",http://www.escholarship.org/,"The UCSB Library administers an Open Access Fund, which is a program that grants an award of up to $3000 to authors who want to make their research freely accessible to all readers immediately upon publication. Additionally, the UCSB Library runs a “Scholarly Communication Express” program. This program allows authors to schedule a personal consultation or a short presentation for their department, organization, or group regarding topics such as the UC Open Access Policy; UC Publication Management System; and eScholarship, UC’s open access repository and publishing platform, among other things.  UCSB authors are also received reduced rates for article publication charges for select open access and hybrid journals. The UC libraries and the California Digital Library negotiated such discounts while licensing access to subscription journals and databases from publishers.

UCSC and most other campuses are set to enact the policy in the 2014-15 academic year (although a waiver is available on a case-by-case basis). The goal of the policy is to ensure free public access to research articles authored by UC faculty. You will benefit by having your research widely and publicly available, you may still re-use it for various purposes, modify it for future research publications, and potentially have this help fulfill grant requirements.",,"Preamble

The Faculty of the University of California is committed to disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In particular, as part of a public university system, the Faculty is dedicated to making its scholarship available to the people of California and the world. Furthermore, the Faculty recognizes the benefits that accrue to themselves as individual scholars and to the scholarly enterprise from such wide dissemination, including greater recognition, more thorough review, consideration and critique, and a general increase in scientific, scholarly and critical knowledge. Faculty further recognize that by this policy, and with the assistance of the University, they can more easily and collectively reserve rights that might otherwise be signed away, often unnecessarily, in agreements with publishers. In keeping with these considerations, and for the primary purpose of making our scholarly articles widely and freely accessible, the Faculty adopts the following policy:

Grant of License and Limitations

Each Faculty member grants to the University of California a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, and to authorize others to do the same, for the purpose of making their articles widely and freely available in an open access repository. Any other systematic uses of the licensed articles by the University of California must be approved by the Academic Senate. This policy does not transfer copyright ownership, which remains with Faculty authors under existing University of California policy.

Scope and Waiver (Opt-Out)

The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a member of the Faculty except for any articles published before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. Upon express direction by a Faculty member, the University of California will waive the license for a particular article or delay access to the article for a specified period of time.

Deposit of Articles

To assist the University in disseminating and archiving the articles, Faculty commit to helping the University obtain copies of the articles. Specifically, each Faculty member who does not permanently waive the license above will provide an electronic copy of his or her final version of the article to the University of California by the date of its publication, for inclusion in an open access repository. When appropriate, a Faculty member may instead notify the University of California if the article will be freely available in another repository or as an open-access publication. Faculty members who have permanently waived the license may nonetheless deposit a copy with the University of California or elsewhere for archival purposes.

Notwithstanding the above, this policy does not in any way prescribe or limit the venue of publication. This policy neither requires nor prohibits the payment of fees or publication costs by authors.

Oversight of Policy

The Academic Senate and the University of California will be jointly responsible for implementing this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending any changes to the Faculty. Any changes to the text of this policy will require approval by both the Academic Senate and the University of California. The Academic Senate and the University of California will review the policy within three years, and present a report to the Faculty and the University of California.

The Faculty calls upon the Academic Senate and the University of California to develop and monitor mechanisms that would render implementation and compliance with the policy as convenient for the Faculty as possible.",http://guides.library.ucsc.edu/openaccess/uploadservice,Library can upload content for users.,http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/,--

            In order to allow for broad dissemination of their research, the Libraries faculty grant to The Regents of the University of Colorado, a body corporate, on behalf of the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to their scholarly work, as long as the works are properly attributed to the authors and not used for commercial purposes. The nonexclusive nature of this license allows faculty to retain full ownership of the material, including the right to further publish it where they wish.
            Libraries faculty shall inform publishers about this policy and that they have granted a pre-existing License. This policy with the Libraries may serve to help negotiate with publishers that require an exclusive right to publish.
Libraries faculty will provide the Libraries with electronic copies of the final version of the author's peer-reviewed manuscript or published version of their scholarly work in an appropriate format (e.g., PDF). These copies will be made publicly available via the University of Colorado Boulder’s institutional repository. Faculty will affirm the grant of the license described above upon submission of their work.
           This policy applies only to scholarly work that is journal articles and conference proceedings authored or co-authored by current faculty after the date of adoption of this policy. Faculty are also encouraged to provide the Libraries with electronic copies of other types of scholarly work as appropriate.
           The Dean of the Libraries or the Dean’s designate will waive application of this policy upon written request from faculty for any reason. In cases where a publisher will not allow dissemination of the final version of an article, faculty are encouraged to provide the Libraries with a version (e.g., pre-print or post-print) that can be made openly accessible under the publisher’s policy.

The University of Houston uses an electronic thesis/dissertation submission process. Please check with your specific department for details regarding the college’s steps for submitting an electronic dissertation.

Approval of Thesis or Dissertation Proposal
Students must receive approval of their thesis or dissertation proposal from their thesis or dissertation committee. The committee is appointed by the dean of the college upon the advice of the appropriate department chair.

In some departments, students may not begin research prior to admission to candidacy without the approval of an advisor. The thesis or dissertation must present evidence of a mastery of the literature in an area of study, a significant contribution to knowledge, and the ability to conduct independent research.

Every thesis, dissertation or other research project involving the use of Human subjects must be approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects before research is started. Students should consult their faculty advisors for information. For additional information or an application form, contact the Office of Research Policies, Compliance and Committees, 316 Ezekiel W. Cullen Building, (713) 743-9204.

The final draft of the thesis or dissertation must be completed and submitted to the advisory committee as early as stipulated by the committee, but no later than the deadlines specified in the academic calendar.

Suggested Form for Thesis or Dissertation
As a general rule, the format and style of presentation should conform to the most acceptable standards of scientific and scholarly writing in the discipline. For instances in which this general rule is an inadequate guide, reference should be made to a style manual approved by the college or department.

Before preparing the thesis or dissertation, the student should obtain a copy of the guide for the preparation and submission of theses and dissertations from the appropriate college office.

Electronic Submission of Thesis or Dissertation
Students and faculty will use Vireo or UMI/ProQuest per the instructions found on http://www.uh.edu/graduate-school/current-students/thesis/ for processing thesis or dissertation material.  Documentation will be submitted as a Portable Document Format (PDF) per the guidelines on the web site, and all program/department/college specific requirements must be followed by the student.  Bound copies may be requested by the student, but will not be specifically maintained by the program/department/college/library.
 
Previous Publication of Materials
Students who have previously published portions of their electronic thesis or dissertation (ETD) in professional journals or in books must demonstrate who ultimately retains the copyright to the published works before material can be made publicly available in UH Libraries’ Vireo repository.  It is the student’s responsibility to determine copyright ownership; he/she should consult the contracts signed between the student and the publisher to determine the copyright holder.

Future Publication of Materials
Any future publication (article or book) should include a note indicating that the material is, or is based upon, a thesis or dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the designated degree at the University of Houston.

ProQuest Open Access Publishing
In addition to the rights granted under Section I of this UMI® Publishing Agreement, ProQuest/UMI may reproduce, distribute, display and transmit the Work in electronic format in the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Open database (PQDT Open) or successor database(s), where it will be made available for free download. PQDT Open may be accessed by the academic community as well as through major search engines and open access harvesters.

Researchers are required to submit journal articles that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central.  The policy requires that these articles be publicly accessible in order to advance science and improve human health. Almost all colleges have faculty that have NIH funding, with the most prominent ones being Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Allied Health, Pharmacy and Public Health. 
 The law states ""The NIH Public Access Policy implements Division G, Title II, Section 218 of PL 110-161 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008) which states:

SEC. 218. The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall require that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for them to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication, to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication.""

Faculty who receive funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) or from the Institute of Education Science (IES), also need to make their articles publicly available within 6 to 12 months of publication.  
",,"While the University does not have an open access policy, it is expected one will be created in the next 6-9 months.  

UIC has a repository, INDIGO, where scholarly Intellectual property in DIGital form is made available online in an open environment. INDIGO collects, disseminates, and provides persistent and reliable access to the research and scholarship of faculty, staff and students at UIC. Faculty, staff and graduate students can deposit their research and scholarship-unpublished, and in many cases, published-directly into INDIGO.  Departments can also use INDIGO to distribute their working papers, technical reports, or other research material. ",http://indigo.uic.edu/,"The University Library supports open access to research in many ways.  One opportunity is the ability for faculty to self archive their publications in INDIGO, UIC's institutional repository.   In addition, the library has an Open Access journal publishing platform where 5 journals are currently published.   Two of these journals are also archived in PubMed Central.  There are also several open access memberships (BMC, HINDAWI), which allow University authors to get discounts on the open access publishing fees when they publish in these journals.  There is also an Open Access fund (ROAAP) where authors can apply for funds to use for open access publishing.   The funds are provided by the University Library, the Provost's Office, and the the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research).",http://researchguides.uic.edu/sc,--

RESOLUTION

The Research Library Council recommends that:

WHEREAS the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s longstanding commitment to the free and open publication, presentation and discussion of research advances the interests of the scholarly community, the faculty individually, and the public, and

WHEREAS the costs of commercially published scholarly journals are continually rising at rates greater than the rate of inflation and higher than the rate of UMass Amherst budget increases, and

WHEREAS the activities of the publishers of these journals directly depend upon the continued participation of faculty at UMass Amherst and similar institutions acting as editors, reviewers, and authors, and

WHEREAS a lasting solution to this problem requires not only interim measures but also a long range plan, and

WHEREAS publication in open access journals and repositories is an increasingly effective option for scholarly communication,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the University of Massachusetts Amherst Faculty Senate:
1. Encourages faculty to become familiar with the pricing and business practices of journals and journal publishers in their specialty, and to support journals and publishers whose pricing and accessibility policies promote broad and continuing access to scholarship.
2. Urges faculty, especially tenured faculty, to exert a positive influence on the direction of scholarly publishing through the choices they make in the submission of papers, the commitment of time to refereeing activities, and participation in editorial work.
3. Encourages faculty and UMass Amherst to support new models for scholarly publishing, including open access journals and archives, disciplinary and institutional repositories and other approaches that enhance the broad dissemination of knowledge while preserving peer review and excellence in scholarship.
4. Urges faculty to consider carefully the copyright provisions of their contracts with publishers, in order to allow them greater freedom to disseminate their work and thereby maximize the impact of their scholarship.
5. Calls upon the UMass Amherst faculty and administration to consider these issues in the evolution of the promotion and tenure system.

Waiver requests must be made in writing, or via a system (such as an online form) that may be made available for this specific purpose.

The Provost or Provost’s designate will waive application of the license for a particular article or delay access for a specified period of time upon express direction by a Faculty member.

Each Faculty member will provide an electronic copy of the author’s final version of each article no later than the date of its publication at no charge to the appropriate representative of the Provost’s Office in an appropriate format specified by the Provost’s Office. The Provost’s Office may make the article available to the public in an open-­access repository.

The Graduate College requires that all students who submit a thesis or dissertation complete a ScholarWorks permission form (see http://wmich.edu/grad/forms/diss_checkform.pdf  and http://libguides.wmich.edu/scholarworks_permissions) at the time the thesis or dissertation is submitted to the Graduate College for review. 

Faculty and staff that conduct research are required to follow all applicable sponsor guidelines (http://www.wmich.edu/research/pdf/policies/research-misconduct-policy2006.pdf). At this time, this means that all researchers funded by NIH are required to deposit publications resulting from their research in PubMed, an open access repository (http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm).

The faculty publications project is currently a small sampling of work published by Williams College faculty. Williams faculty are leaders in their fields – recognized nationally, and often internationally, for the high quality and significance of their publications and creative work. However, due to copyright restrictions, many of these publications cannot be added to Unbound. The current contents of the faculty publication collection come from open-access journals."
