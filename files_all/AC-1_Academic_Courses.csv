Introduces the concept of sustainable development through historic antecedents in the classics and economic theory. Major topics include development and the environment, alternatives to development, system modeling, and indicators and norms for sustainable development. Through guest panelists from the CSE and the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, key policy issues will be raised. 
ENVN 101 Fundamentals of Environmental Studies (1)
A theoretical and practical introduction to the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies. Cultivates both a broad understanding of ecological principles and the creative capacity to imagine and enact individual and social change that takes those principles into account. 
ENVN 102 Introduction to the Environment (1) 
Explores the interconnected web of earth's natural systems including the atmosphere, biological communities, oceans and continents, as well as humankind's interactions with and dependence on them. Major topics include global climate and problems of global warming and desertification; resources and problems of world hunger and population growth; and pollution and problems of ecosystem destruction. 
ENVN 201 Ecology and Environmental Field Trip (1/2) 
Prerequisites: Membership in the Center for Sustainability of the Environment and permission of the instructor.
Demonstrates, in seminars and a one-two week field trip to a selected region of the United States, how ecosystems have been shaped by the interplay of biological, geological and human history and are thus both adapted to and susceptible to changes in, modern landscape, climate and human practices. Examines environmental issues of both local and national significance related to these ecosystems. 
ENVN 206 Sustainable Living Seminar (1/2) 
Residents of the College's E-house and other students explore, through practice, the relationship between their daily actions and the earth's ecosystems. Several models of sustainability are discussed, and students are asked to articulate the view they believe appropriate for their own lives. Students cooperatively develop a significant improvement in the house or its grounds and monitor the environmental footprint of their actions. 
ENVN 220 Economics, Politics, and Environmental Policy (1) 
Examines decisions affecting environmental quality made by government, businesses and individuals; economic analysis relevant to such decisions; the policy-making process; and dispute resolution techniques that may be useful in conflicts over environmental issues. Focuses on current national and local environmental policies, with comparisons to practices in other countries. 
A&S 240 Ancient Civilizations (1)
Although the human species has been on the planet in its present form for at least 100,000 years, complexly organized societies with cities, governments and organized religions did not emerge until the last 5,000. This phenomenon took place independently throughout the globe, and while some ancient civilizations collapsed, others became the foundations upon which the modern world was constructed. Why is this so? Through a comparative analysis of Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Indus, Maya, Aztec and Incan societies, among others, students will learn to analyze the factors that have led to the emergence and transformation of civilizations.
A&S 271 The Global Politics of Nature (1)
An introduction to environmental anthropology. Explores anthropological perspectives on the relationship between nature and culture. What is the power of nature as an idea? What part does it play in American culture? What are some other ways people have thought about nature and culture around the world? Addresses global and local issues, the impact of environmental justice movements, and conflicts over conservation of species and habitats.
A&S 357 Violent Environments (1)
Does environmental degradation produce violence? What is the relationship between population growth, resource scarcity and violent conflict? In what ways do different environments (e.g., African national parks, Appalachian coal mines, hurricane-ravaged coastal cities) feature differential access to and control over natural and economic resources? This course first explores anthropological perspectives on violence, including biological, archaeological and cultural approaches to understanding war. Then, it investigates the multifaceted linkages between environments and conflict—the articulations among resource extraction, urbanization, economic development, population growth, biotechnology, biodiversity, natural disasters, human health, structural violence and social inequality.
ARTH 315 Earth Art and the Environment (1)
Examines American (U.S.) and European art and architecture that interacts with the environment and calls attention to the benefits and consequences of human interaction with the environment in a national and global context. Focuses on art, architecture and design projects produced from 1960 to the present and materials that set the context for artistic concerns about the environment beginning in the nineteenth century.
BIOL 195 Ecology, Evolution and Biodiversity (1)
Focuses on whole organisms and their evolutionary and ecological relationships. Evolutionary processes, biological diversity, conservation biology and human impacts on ecology and biodiversity are major themes. Skills introduced are hypothesis testing, experimental design, use of primary literature in writing assignments and basic statistics. Lecture and laboratory.
CHEM 206 Chemical Analysis (1) 
Prerequisite: Chemistry 121; Chemistry 123 recommended. 
Laboratory course emphasizing the collection, analysis and interpretation of quantitative data, using both traditional and instrumental techniques.
COMM 311 Environmental Communication (1)
A study of how the natural environment is socially constructed through its representation in word and image. After introducing students to fundamental environmental terminology, the course will consider a number of key environmental communicators, their ideological positions, and how they shape their messages. This will be followed by a discussion of audiences and environmental communication ethics. Offered occasionally.
ENGL 206 Writing in Place (1) 
An experiential study of environmental writing, with a focus on place, nature, and the relationship between humans and their environments. Students write in a variety of genres and modes, including exposition and creative non-fiction.
ENGL 238 Terrorists and Treehuggers (1) 
An interdisciplinary study of the past, present, and future of environmental radicalism. Typical authors include Rachel Carson, Edward Abbey, Paul Watson, and Wangari Maathai.
ENGL 389 Wild Things: The Literature of Wilderness and the Wild
This course explores literary representations of wildness and wilderness—both as ideas and geographical realities—in order to reflect on what we value in the natural world and why. We will investigate how the fictional and nonfictional stories we tell ourselves about wildness and wilderness shape our decisions regarding how we live in relation to the natural world.

GEOL 104 Earth Resources and the Environment (1) 
Without earth resources, civilization would not exist. Gold, diamonds, water, oil, building materials--all of our material resources ultimately are derived from the earth. This course examines the origin and geologic occurrence of these materials and the environmental implications of their utilization. No laboratory.
GEOL 106 Natural Disasters (1) 
A review of the natural disasters that affect humans and the environment. Emphasizes the causes and prediction of natural hazards, assessment of hazard vulnerability, and disaster mitigation and recovery through case studies of historical and recent natural disasters. Topics include earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, extreme weather, climate change and floods. No laboratory.
GEOL 115 Oceans, Atmosphere and Climate (1) 
Describes the world's oceans and atmosphere and considers how they interact with one another, and with humans. Topics include the geological evolution of the ocean basins, ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns, ocean currents, climate and weather patterns, storms and weather fronts, paleo-oceanography and the history of climate, and the chemical composition of the oceans. Emphasizes the role of the oceans in mediating global climate, global change, global dispersal of pollution and other environmental concerns. No laboratory. Offered in alternate years.
HIST 337 Environmental History (1) 
Focus on the historical roots of contemporary environmental problems. Analysis of both the destructive and the conservation sides of the American experience. Native American perspectives, women and nature, technology, Thoreau, John Muir, energy crisis, ecology as the subversive science, a land ethic, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and environmental impacts (DDT, Love Canal, atomic testing, PBB, dioxin, acid rain) are stressed. Concentration on America, but within a global frame of reference. Interdisciplinary emphasis that invites students from a variety of majors, particularly those in the sciences and those treating public policy issues. Special opportunities for those who enjoy the out-of-doors.
PHIL 301 Environmental Ethics (1)
Examines theoretical and practical perspectives on ethical issues in relation to the environment. The theoretical issues range from whether we should assign moral value to species other than the human (and if so, on the basis of what criteria) to whether we have moral obligations to preserve the environment for future generations (and if so, what this would imply for the present generations). The practical issues range from creating incentives for restricting population growth without abdicating responsibilities toward the world's hungry, to the issue of what short-and long-term policies and practices need to be adopted to deal effectively with reducing pollution and hazardous waste while working toward a recycling, sustainable global society.

SENS 100

The concept of sustainability is explored as it relates to human-dominated and natural ecosystems at spatial scales from local to global. The major environmental problems facing the United States and the world are evaluated in terms of interactions among ecological, social, economic, and spiritual factors. Emphasis is placed on understanding the methods by which sustainability is evaluated and actions that can be taken to increase the resilience of a community or society. Local ecosystems will be used as a context for learning. Two lectures or laboratory/field exercises each week. Practical Reasoning (PR). 

SENS 215 Apal. Sustainable Community

An introduction to practical knowledge and approaches for increasing the sustainability of communities and households in the Appalachian region and beyond. Within the context of basic community needs such as food, water, energy, and health, students learn actions that they can take for their household, and steps that the community, as a whole, can take through the efforts of city government, non-profit organizations and other groups. Examples from Appalachian communities are included that illustrate successful and promising approaches, and students participate in projects that assist a local community to become more sustainable. 

SENS 225 Env. Justice

This course is an introduction to the study of Environmental Justice and issues associated with access to, and equitable sharing of, the products of a healthy environment, including clean water and air, healthy food, non-toxic communities, and environmental security. The history of the environmental justice movement beginning with its foundations in the Civil Rights and Environmental movements will be studied, followed by a survey and analysis of current issues of environmental justice, particularly in relation to minority and poor communities in the United States and worldwide.

It is a prudent approach to resource use that recognizes the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental systems and earth’s finite capacity to satisfy human needs and desires. Sustainability-focused courses explore obstacles to maintaining the integrity of the earth’s social, economic, and environmental systems as the central topic of the course and look for interdisciplinary solutions to meet these challenges. Sustainability-related courses may explore topics other than sustainability as the central focus, but integrate and emphasize a sustainability concept or issue as a distinct unit or subunit within the course.",Each course was counted as a single course regardless of the number of offerings or sections,,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,**,--,--,--

She met with each department chair or program director to review the list of courses she created and to discuss their thoughts on the role of sustainability within their division. After several professors inquired further about the requirements for a sustainability-related versus -focused courses, she expanded the definitions for the classification of sustainability courses to the following:
• Sustainability-related courses: The course helps “build knowledge about a component of 
sustainability or introduce students to sustainability concepts during part of the 
course. ...[They may provide] students with in-depth knowledge of a particular aspect or 
dimension of sustainability (such as the natural environment), ...a focus area (such as 
renewable energy) for a student’s sustainability studies, or they may broaden students’ 
understanding of sustainability from within different disciplines” (AASHE STARS, 
2012, p. 43)
• Sustainability-focused courses: The course “provides valuable grounding in the concepts 
and principles of sustainability. These courses educate students about how different 
dimensions of sustainability relate to and support each other in theory and practice. In 
addition, these courses help equip students with the skills to weave together disparate 
components of sustainability in addressing complex issues” (AASHE STARS, 2012, p.

It annually reviews the overall Cornell course listings to identify new sustainability-focused and related courses.

In June 2013, the entire course catalog and course descriptions were analyzed to ensure that the courses on ACSF’s Sustainability Curricula list were relevant to environment, energy, and/or economic development. All courses were identified as either sustainability-focused or sustainability-related based on STARS definitions of the two. This analysis yielded a more up-to-date list with additional sustainability focused and related courses. 

In 2014 & 2015, all courses on the ACSF’s Sustainability Curricula list were checked to verify that all courses were still being taught at Cornell. Those that were no longer offered were deleted from the list, and those that were still offered were updated. Starting in 2014, professors were also given the opportunity to tag their own class as a sustainability course upon course registration. This self-selecting methodology has proven useful, as new courses have been added to the ACSF Sustainability Curricula list as a result. 

Courses that were previously tagged as sustainability focused or related were re-evaluated to meet STARS new definitions of “sustainability course” (which is still called ‘focused’ on ACSF’s list) and “course that includes sustainability” (‘related’). Professors of questionable courses were contacted; they were asked to confirm whether or not their courses fit one of the definitions provided by AASHE. 

Semester at Sea programs and other study abroad programs that are not directly affiliated with Cornell were not added to the list because they do not satisfy what STARS considers part of the course roster. Programs like SHOALS and other courses that include an abroad trip, however, were added to the sustainable course directory because they are directly affiliated with Cornell. Courses that were not added to the list (and in few cases, deleted from the list) include honors thesis credits, research credits, independent study options, and internship credits.

1. ""Sustainability Connections (SCON)"" = course that includes sustainability 
2. ""Sustainability Investigations (SINV)"" = sustainability courses

The nomination form asks faculty to provide information about their courses that relate to stated criteria for sustainability course designations. The form must be completed each semester, even if indicating same designation as before. Designations are completed by section of the course as each faculty member may choose to vary the approach and content for the section they are teaching.

Nomination forms are compiled each semester, approved by a steering committee, posted online, and sent to the registrar. The registrar then adds searchable ""SCON"" and ""SINV"" attributes to approved designated courses in our course search system. These attributes are actively used by students to complete course searches.

The criteria for designation of Sustainability Investigations (SINV) courses are:

- Course learning goals support attainment of at least one of the sustainability competencies and dispositions.
- Sustainability is a major theme, though not necessarily the sole theme, of the course.
- Students are engaged in deep and focused exploration of sustainability and its multiple dimensions (e.g. environmental, social, economic, and/or cultural).
- Engagement with exploration of sustainability is accomplished through assignments, lectures, discussions, and readings that collectively represent a significant portion of students’ work in the course.
- Grading of student performance gives significant weight to sustainability related assignments.
- Explicit reference to sustainability is included in the course syllabus.

The criteria for designation of Sustainability Connections (SCON) courses are:

- Course learning goals support attainment of at least one of the sustainability competencies and dispositions.
- Students are introduced to sustainability, sustainable development, or related concepts, but normally sustainability is not a major emphasis, theme, or topic of the course.
- The course builds student competencies in knowledge and methods of a field that is relevant to understanding environmental, social, economic, or other dimension of sustainability.
- Students learn how knowledge and methods that are the subject of the course can be applied or made relevant to inquiries about sustainability.
-Connections to sustainability could be done through one or more lectures, labs, classroom discussions, reading assignments, writing assignments, oral presentations, field experiences, research assignments, creative work, or other assignments.
- The connection to sustainability may emphasize just one dimension of sustainability (e.g. environmental, social, economic, or cultural), but students should be made aware of other dimensions as well.
- Explicit reference to sustainability is included in the course syllabus.",Each offering or section of a course was counted as an individual course,"All sustainability course data is managed and accessed through the registrar. Sustainability course nominations are tied to faculty members teaching the course and can vary across sections of the same course. Therefore, total sections (excluding internships, practicums, independent study, independent research, physical education, and performing arts) were obtained for each semester through the registrar. Individual sections of a course were then counted as SCON, SINV, or neither.",--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,**,True,--,"Dickinson offers over 100 courses each academic year that help students gain knowledge about sustainability concepts, problems, and solutions while building competencies and dispositions for creating a sustainable world. Over time, these courses have been integrated throughout the Dickinson curriculum in over 39 academic departments.  The courses vary in the degree to which sustainability is a focus of study and are classified into two categories. Sustainability Investigations courses (SINV) engage students in a deep and focused study of problems with sustainability as a major emphasis of the course. Sustainability Connections courses (SCON) engage students in making connections between the main topic of the course and sustainability. Sustainability is related to but is not a major focus of SCON courses.

Dickinson offers numerous courses in arts and humanities, social sciences, and laboratory sciences that explore the different dimensions of sustainability from a variety of perspectives. Over 96% of our Class of 2015 graduates will have taken a sustainability course during their studies at Dickinson, without requirement. Beginning with the Class of 2019, all students must complete a sustainability course as a graduation requirement.

Dickinson students can identify sustainability courses using the course designations Sustainability Investigations (SINV) or Sustainability Connections (SCON) when conducting an online course search. Faculty nominate these courses each semester using our Sustainability Course Designation process. These two categories of course designation differ in the degree to which sustainability is a focus."

The minor requires students to take courses from three content tracks within sustainability, which are designated by the course attributes SMTA (Sustainability Minor Track A), SMTB (Sustainability Minor Track B), and SMTC (Sustainability Minor Track C). By popular demand, and due to a transition to an electronic course bulletin, we have begun to label any course with significant sustainability related material with the new course attribute “SUST”. For courses that fulfill the minor in sustainability, they are designated with both the SMTA/B/C attribute and the SUST attribute. Courses that do not fulfill the minor but which do have sustainability related content will be designated solely with the SUST attribute. This is most applicable for graduate level courses which are sustainability related but not open for undergraduate level students. 
Our goal is to encourage students interested in sustainability to use the attribute as they search for courses, whether or not they are part of the undergraduate minor in sustainability.  The ability to search for sustainability courses using the SUST attribute is fully described in the new GW Bulletin. 
The original faculty committee developed the following definition to identify sustainability-related courses. Such courses include one or more of the following criterial:
•	1.Content related to sustainable development: creating healthy and thriving resource systems for all;
•	2.Content related to environmental issues;
•	3.Content related to social issues that can be applied to sustainable development such as human welfare, social equity issues or social / organizational / behavioral change;
•	4.Content related to economic issues that can be applied to sustainable development;
•	5.Discourse focused on the interconnection of world resources and the human condition from a long-term perspective;
•	6.Content related to policy and communications issues that can be applied to sustainable development.
The responsible parties for this inventory are the Director of the Sustainability Minor, the Executive Director of Sustainability, the Senior Fellow for Sustainability, the Faculty Coordinator for Sustainability, and the Sustainability Student Adviser. With review and input by faculty members, this team adds and maintains courses in this inventory.  Over the 15/16 academic year we once again went through the University Bulletin to update the offered courses. We also reached out to Department Chairs to ask about the courses taught in their departments and whether there was sustainability content.  In many cases, the answer was yes.  We added these courses to the inventory.  
For the purposes of this inventory and because there are no real electives, we eliminated the nursing and medical schools from this inventory.   
GW defines departments by those subdivisions with a department Chairperson. The definition of a department chair varies across our large university.  In some cases, a department chair might oversee few to no courses and faculty but rather oversee an academic subject matter where courses and faculty are largely drawn from other department s (e.g., Africana Studies).  In other cases, an entire school may not have departments (e.g. Law School).  With this caveat, GW recognizes  52 departments, excluding the school of medicine (we would also exclude nursing, however the school of nursing does not have departments).

Engineering Sciences 137. Energy within Environmental Constraints
This course provides a systematic introduction to the energy system for students in engineering and applied sciences. Students should gain a working understanding of the some of the most important energy technologies, from prime movers--gas turbines, steam cycles, and reciprocating engines--to secondary energies including fuel production and refining technologies and the electricity transmission and distribution system. The course aims at a systematic understanding of the energy system's environmental footprint as a tool to help students who will work to reduce it. Energy is a commodity. One cannot hope to re-shape the energy system to meet environmental constrains without a rough working understanding of energy markets--costs, prices and elasticities of supply and demand. So the course will integrate engineering economics and other applied social sciences into the treatment of energy technologies to enable a system's view of energy.

IGA-528: Technology and Policy
The classical economist describes technological change as the residual that explains economic growth through changes the observed productivity of capital and labor. Policy analysis too often builds on this foundation by taking technological change as an exogenous force that slowly shifts the balance of power between actors. These views are too passive. Form birth control to nitrogen fertilizers, robots and nuclear weapons, society shapes technology; and, technological change—revolutionary or incremental—reshapes society. Governments seek to shape technology to their ends, environmental be they protection or economic growth, fostering democracy or enabling repression. Business and civil society organizations likewise seek to shape technologies and are themselves reshaped by technological change. This course is structured on two dimensions: case studies and a technology analysis toolkit. A set of four case studies that will be selected from areas including human reprogenetics, cyber security, energy and environment, nuclear weapons, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence. Each case study will combine lecture and a structured policy analysis exercise. Each case will involve one other HKS faculty to give lectures describing the technology and policy space and to critique the student policy exercises. The technology analysis toolkit will cover tools for understanding and managing technological change groups in the four broad areas: assessment and forecasting, governmental policy, non-state actors, and international policy.

Science of the Physical Universe 25. Energy and Climate for the 21st Century
The course provides an historical account of the evolution of the modern energy system, from early dependence on human and animal power, to the subsequent use of wind and water, to more recent reliance on fossil fuels—coal, oil and natural gas—and even more recently to the development of the ability to tap the energy contained in the nucleus. It will discuss the important historical advances in the applications of energy, notably in the production and distribution of electricity and in the transportation sector - where oil-derived products provide the motive force for cars, trucks, trains, ships and planes. It will highlight the energy related problems we confront today, with particular emphasis on air pollution, on the threat of global climate change, on the hazards of nuclear proliferation, and on the risks to national security imposed by our increasing reliance on imported sources of oil. It concludes with a discussion of options for a more sustainable energy future.
Note: Students who have taken Science A-52 may not take this course for credit. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Core area requirement for Science A.

*Freshman Seminar 21D. Food, Climate, and Data
We will explore the implications of interacting trends in population, diet, and climate for food security. The course begins with some background literature on food security, initially juxtaposing Malthus and Boserup, and then moving to Sen. The primary focus, however, is a data-driven exploration of food security through analysis of weather, climate, demographics, and yield. Specific questions that we will empirically address are how temperature and precipitation influence yield outcomes?  an agriculture be adapted to a changed climate?  How will demographics and diet shift in the coming decades? Will the green revolution continue to yield steady increases? And can we predict famine?

*Freshman Seminar 42H. The U.S. Energy Revolution and its Implications
The U.S. “energy revolution” – nonconventional oil and gas production (fracking), increasing use of renewable energy, and reduced demand – has contributed to a sharp decline in U.S. oil imports, a 10% reduction in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. This course examines the changing U.S. energy landscape, energy security, U.S. climate policy, and the connection between these issues and our own lives. Four case studies (biofuels, mining coal on public lands, regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, and university divestment) illustrate the economic considerations, tradeoffs, and legal and political constraints facing U.S. energy and climate policy in practice.

Sustainability in Practice: These courses have an applied focus, and offer a substantial research or service-learning component related to sustainability and the environment. Although these courses may also cover theoretical aspects, they are differentiated from the above group by providing both hands-on experiences and more focus on the application of theory and basic science.
Sustainable Solutions: Either through a seminar course or independent research, students focus on a particular issue such as energy, food, or sustainable design and work towards the development of practical solutions.
Sustainable Communities: These courses examine sustainability at the community level. They focus on analysis and problem solving by examining a variety of issues confronted by a particular community, and offer opportunities to work with members of that community to understand and solve problems at the human-environment interface.

ARH 101 Exploring Sustainability, Design, and The Built Environment
This course is an exploration of global built environments, with a focus on explaining significant design styles, movements, and trends within the context of the arts, politics, technology, business, the sciences, the social sciences, and an emphasis on sustainability. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course discusses the recent history of design in the built environment - what has impacted it and why. It is part of the three-course foundation for all Architecture and Interior Design students and is also a Liberal Arts elective.

ARH 144 Introduction to Sustainable Construction
This course is an introduction to the theory and principles of innovative sustainable construction with a focus on residential construction. The course takes an integrated design and ecological systems approach to high performance green building. Students learn how to reduce the ecological impact of the built environment using cutting-edge best practices. Topics include climate change, green building principles, performance standards and measurements, and rating systems including LEED(R) for Homes. Cost, life cycle assessment, energy efficiency, renewable energy and solar elements, and valuing ""natural capital"" will be discussed.

ARH 244 Residential Energy Performance
This course is a fundamental study of energy efficiency and building science with an emphasis on residential energy performance and analysis. Topics include basic energy principles; building thermal boundary; and the control of air, heat, and moisture. The interaction of building components with environmental factors is essential to the discussion. Efficiency strategies for lighting, appliances, heating, cooling, and water heating will be introduced. Strategies for dealing with home health, air quality, and combustion safety problems will be discussed. Fundamentals of building inspection and diagnosis will be covered, including the use of the blower-door, duct-blaster, manometer, infrared camera, smoke generator and other testing equipment. Students must be available for two four-hour field experiences, times and days to be determined.

ARH 245 Solar Design in the Built Environment
This course introduces the design and application of solar energy in building design and construction. The primary focus is on passive solar energy, daylighting and shading strategies. Discussion topics include the historical development of solar energy in buildings, designing with nature, energy conservation, heat theory and thermal comfort, solar processes, passive and active solar energy systems, thermal mass and storage, solariums, natural ventilation strategies and earth-sheltered buildings.

ARH 263 Green Building Rating Systems
This course acquaints the student with rating systems that seek to define and measure sustainable, high-performing ""green"" buildings.

Due to a low response rate, we believe that this approach failed to identify a number of existing sustainability courses.

In 2013-14, for our current STARS report, we reviewed the original course list and expanded it by (1) searching the online Penn State curriculum archives, and evaluating the material found in the course descriptions and syllabi, (2) searching through course descriptions found in the online Course Bulletin, with special attention given to programs where one or more sustainability courses had already been identified, and (3) revising the course survey and encouraging faculty to complete it.  We are in the process of verifying this expanded list by contacting the individual course instructors.  Although it is possible that we have misidentified some sustainability courses using this approach, we think this is more likely to be an underestimate than an overestimate of the all such courses offered at Penn State.

The course counts provided above include only courses actually offered during academic year 2012-13.  The full inventory attached includes all sustainability courses  ""on the books"" at Penn State; 30 additional courses were identified and added to the list in March 2016, for a total of 323 courses.

Methodology for 2010 Course Survey:
A request to complete an on-line questionnaire was sent from the university provost to all deans and chancellors, thence to all department heads and thence to course instructors – in theory this would reach all course instructors for the 2009-2010 academic year.  
Although announcements and reminders about this course survey were also made via the university’s official news site, the Center for Sustainability web site, and other appropriate venues, we have learned that some instructors did not hear about the survey.  Others heard about it only by word of mouth, and inquired about completing the survey—they were directed to the Course Survey web site.   There were 273 responses from University Park instructors.  Of these, 75 reported teaching at least one sustainability-related or –focused course, with a total of 96 courses reported.
In completing the survey, instructors were not required to work with a particular definition of sustainability; a number of definitions were provided, and they were asked to develop their own concept of sustainability that included social, environmental and economic factors.  
The distinct criteria for sustainability-focused and –related courses were given, and the concept of an immersive experience in sustainability was explained.
Instructors were asked to list sustainability-focused and –related courses and to describe any immersive experiences in sustainability that were offered through their classes.  
",Other (please describe below),"Course counts are for Fall 2012, Spring 2013, and Summer 2013 (one academic year).
Counts were made by semester, then the semester values were totaled to arrive at annual counts.  This method results in courses being counted each semester they are offered - so up to 3 times each year.
Multiple sections of the same course are counted only once each semester. 
If the same course was offered both online and in person during the same semester, it was counted only once.
Counting methods were the same for both sustainability courses and non-sustainability courses.",--,--,--,True,--,--,True,True,**,--,--,"We removed from the course counts, courses in the following categories:  independent study, practicums/ internships, thesis/ research, and individualized instruction in the performance arts.  Still included in the overall counts are courses in physical education (listed under Kinesiology), and group instruction in performance arts such as Dance (e.g., Beginning Ballet), Music (e.g., Campus Choir), and Theater (e.g., Acting I).  These courses could not easily be pulled out for the purpose of the course counts and their presence tends to inflate the number of courses, which lowers the percentage of sustainability courses.

Course list was updated in March 2016 for Sierra Club Cool Schools to include 30 new or previously unidentified courses; however, the count of courses actually offered was not updated.  The count of departments offering sustainability courses was updated."

Portland State University,2016-03-24,2016-03-24 17:18:42,jenny.mcnamara@pdx.edu,2.0,Pursuing,**,216.0,121.0,6683.0,45.0,56.0,3293.0,37.0,63.0,One,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/73/6/460/2617/2014-2015_Sustainability%20Courses%20%2B%20Offerings_STARS.xlsx,,http://www.pdx.edu/sustainability/sustainability-courses,"Students are not going to achieve all of the PSU campus wide sustainability learning outcomes or gain a complete understanding of sustainability through one course. Therefore, the question for sustainability course identification becomes what is the most basic concept of sustainability that must be present in a single course’s content regardless of the topic area.  

To answer this one can think about the inherent nature of sustainability. At its core, sustainability is about interconnectedness or interrelationships between economic, equity, and environmental systems, i.e. the three E’s of sustainability. Building from this, one can then identify a sustainability course by looking at its content to see if it identifies and describes the relationship between the course topic and at least 2 of the 3 E’s of sustainability. A minimum of 2 is required because it’s the articulation of the intersections that define sustainability and not the areas themselves. Therefore if a course identifies and describes the relationships between the course topic and 2 dimensions of sustainability it is sustainability-related. If the content identifies and describes the relationship with all 3 dimensions of sustainability it is sustainability-focused.

This corresponds with the AASHE definitions for sustainability related and focused courses while maintaining interdisciplinary aspects.  It also helps deter the notion that a course about equity or the environment is about sustainability. 

By focusing on course content only, it also avoids pedagogical questions and assumptions about how much lecture time or coursework is needed to educate students about sustainability concepts or what constitutes a “concentration” in sustainability.  Depending on an instructor’s style and teaching methods, a course with one strong sustainability module or comprehensive assignment may be more focused on sustainability than a course that weaves sustainability principles throughout.  

For 2014-2015, the sustainability course rubric and evaluation form (available online at sustainability course inventory website) uses the criteria of “recognizes interrelationships” and the following levels:

Sustainability Focused - Course content identifies and describes the relationship between the course topic, equity, economy, and environmental dimensions

Sustainability Related - Course content identifies and describes the relationship between the course topic and 2 of the 3 dimensions of equity, economy, and environment

Not a Sustainability Course - Course content identifies and describes relationship between the course topic and 1 of the 3 dimensions of equity, economy, and environment or course topic is only about 1 or none of the 3 dimensions.

To keep the course listings up to date, previously identified courses not offered as of Fall 2012 were removed from the sample and not included in the online course listing. 

Sustainability course identification is considered to be a work in progress, and the course evaluation form is a reflection of current best thinking. All identified sustainability courses are subject to review and reclassification as more progress is made and new methodologies are developed.

Courses were identified as Including Sustainability (IS) or a Sustainability Course (SC) based on these steps:

1. Faculty Survey (FS) and Faculty Review (FR)
Faculty were asked to self-identify their courses in a campus-wide survey distributed annually. Unless we were told that all sections of a course include a sustainability component, we only tagged sections taught by the survey respondent. Department Chairs and selected faculty reviewed and provided further clarification regarding course tags.

2. Course attributes in the SCU undergraduate Core Curriculum (I_… or E_…)
If a course is part of the Experiential Learning for Social Justice (I_ELSJ) or Diversity (E_DIV), Civic Engagement (E_CIV), or Ethics (E_ETH) components of the core curriculum, it was automatically tagged as IS. This was followed by further review of each course's title and course description to clarify an accurate tag. Many courses were ""un-tagged"" (UT) during this process because we didn't feel a strong case for an ""Includes Sustainability"" tag.

3. Academic Pathways (PATH_…)
Several of our academic Pathways are inherently related to sustainability. If a course is part of one of these pathways, it was tagged as IS:
Applied Ethics (PATH_AE)
Food, Hunger, Poverty, Environment (PATH_FHP)
Global Health (PATH_GH)
Human Rights (PATH_HR)

12. ENV 101 Environmental Integration I: Perspectives- We have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, characterized by the accelerating impact of human activities on the Earth’s ecosystems. All over the globe, humans have transformed the environment and have sometimes created catastrophic dynamics within social-ecological systems. Scientists have studied these phenomena for decades, alerting both the general public and policy-makers of the consequences of our actions. However, despite convincing evidence of environmental degradation, humans continue to radically transform their environment. This course explores this puzzle and asks how we can remodel our social-ecological systems to build a more sustainable and resilient future. 

13. ENV 150 Modeling Our World: An Introduction to Geographic Information Systems- Same as GEO 150. A geographic information system (GIS) manages locationbased (spatial) information and provides the tools to display and analyze it. GIS provides the capabilities to link databases and maps and to overlay, query, and visualize those databases in order to analyze and solve problems in many diverse fields. This course provides an introduction to the fundamental elements of GIS and applies the analysis of spatial data to issues in geoscience, environmental science, and public policy. 

14.

23. PHI 304 Colloquium in Applied Ethics: Sustainability 
An examination of the conceptual and moral underpinnings of sustainability. Questions to be discussed include: What exactly is sustainability? What conceptions of the world (as resource, as machine, as something with functional integrity, etc.) does sustainability rely on, and are these conceptions justifiable? How is sustainability related to future people? What values are affirmed by sustainability, and how can we argue those are values that should be endorsed? How does sustainability compare with environmental objectives of longer standing such as conservation? Preference given to majors in either philosophy or environmental science and policy. 

24. ECO 324 Seminar Economics of the Environment and Natural Resources- How do we expect competitive markets to allocate natural resources? Will market systems result in excess pollution? Can we improve market outcomes in relation to the environment and natural resources? If so, what are the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches? This course examines these issues through discussion of the economic theories of externalities, common property and public goods and their implications for the allocation of resources. We explore these questions by analyzing specific policy issues and debates related to the environment and resource use including: climate change, pollution, biodiversity, energy, sustainability, land use and fishing rights. Through this exploration, we touch upon a number of other theories and techniques including dynamic optimization and intertemporal choice, price vs. quantity regulation, nonmarket valuation, cost-benefit analysis and the use of incentive-based regulation. Prerequisites: ECO 250 and ECO 220 or permission of the instructor.

34. GOV 364 Seminar in Political Theory Changing the World: The Political Theory of the Anthropocene In 2000, climate scientists suggested for the first time that we might have entered a new geological epoch known as the Anthropocene in the late 18th century. The Anthropocene is primarily characterized by the prevalence of anthropogenic (human-caused) effects on the environment. That is, they suggested, the most important aspect differentiating this geological epoch from those that preceded it is the ability of humans to change the environment itself. This seminar investigates the implications of the Anthropocene for political theory, asking how politics, political action, and the formation of political goals may be affected in the context of a world that is literally being changed by human activity.

6.2.1.1 Relevant Course Offerings

The Education and Research subcommittee of the SSC undertook a survey of existing courses using the 
following definitions of sustainability in the curriculum, adopted from STARS:

 Sustainability-focused courses which concentrate on the concept of sustainability, including its 
social, economic, aesthetic and environmental dimensions, or examine an issue or topic using 
sustainability as a lens.

  Sustainability-related courses which incorporate sustainability as a distinct course component 
or module, or concentrate on a single sustainability principle or issue.

Either as sustainability-focused courses or as sustainability-related courses, sustainability has 
become understandable, practical and relevant to students’ lives. The basic principles of 
sustainability become a relevant integrating theme throughout the curriculum, connecting the 
environment with the economy, sciences, and humanities.

Table 6.1 shows results of a survey of courses at Spelman College that meet the above-defined 
criteria is a snapshot of where we are at currently, with 17 sustainability-focused courses and 18 
sustainability-related courses, a fairly good number at present for a school so small. While not 
all of the following courses are permanent courses as yet, they are in process of review to be so, 
and they have either been taught or are slated.

This list served as the starting point for the sustainability course inventory, and staff began the inventory process by reviewing this list and designating classes as sustainability classes, classes that include sustainability, or neither. However, since Stanford offers such a vast array of classes that fluctuate significantly year to year, Stanford staff and faculty felt it was important to re-evaluate the full list of Stanford class offerings in the 2012-2013 academic year in order to compile a truly complete list of Stanford's sustainability classes and classes that include sustainability. 

To accomplish this, staff audited the entire 2012-2013 course bulletin and identified (based on course descriptions), whether or not courses should be included in the sustainability course inventory. Staff also worked closely with the university's Institutional Research and Decision Support (IRDS) team to determine the number of individual/independent study classes, classes with enrollment of 4 or fewer, and 1 unit classes, in addition to reviewing the total number of classes with and without sections.  With the support of the IRDS, staff decided that individual/independent study classes and classes with enrollment of 4 or fewer should be removed from both the total number of classes and the sustainability course inventory. One-unit classes were kept in the inventory because these classes are often extremely substantive despite only being worth one unit of course credit. This detailed analytic process was performed very carefully and with the input of many campus stakeholders, including Stanford faculty, in order to ensure utmost accuracy.

After this decision-making and calculation process and consultation with Stanford faculty, staff generated a final list of sustainability courses and courses that include sustainability based on all of the above criteria. The new list has been uploaded to the Sustainable Stanford website and has been disseminated to several interested parties, including the Haas Center for Public Service and the School of Earth Sciences. Based on this thorough process, Stanford feels confident that it generated the most accurate and complete list possible of sustainability courses and courses that include sustainability at the university.",Each course was counted as a single course regardless of the number of offerings or sections,,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,True,**,--,--,"All courses where any section of the course had enrollment of 4 or fewer students have been removed, both from the list of sustainability courses and courses that include sustainability and from the total number of courses.

Courses can be one of the two classifications, but not both. For a full description of the STARS credit (AC-1) associated with this list, please refer to the STARS Technical Manual starting on page 24: https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html.

Efforts to fulfill this reporting requirement and demonstrate ESF’s commitment to sustainability and the depth to which sustainability is incorporated into courses across the curriculum have been ongoing for several years, using the framework of STARS versions 1.x. In 2011, a team of staff, students, faculty and administrators conducted a thorough assessment of courses and surveyed faculty, requesting they self-classify their courses, as part of the self-study for Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) reaccreditation: “Advancing Sustainability at ESF.” Subsequent surveys of faculty and additional analyses to update the list were conducted from 2012-2014 by staff from the ESF Sustainability Office. 

The most recent update to this course list has been prepared for ESF’s 2016 STARS submission, under the revised criteria and reporting guidelines of STARS 2.0. Staff from the ESF Sustainability Office reviewed previous course assessments in the context of the current reporting guidelines with consideration of best practices for reporting exemplified by other schools, and updated ESF’s course list accordingly. The primary update to the course list in 2016 was to add numerous courses that fit the current definitions of “Sustainability Courses” (formerly “Sustainability-Focused Courses”) and “Courses That Include Sustainability” (formerly “Sustainability-Related Courses”). A small number of courses were switched from one classification to the other, or removed from the list because they are not currently being offered and do not appear in the online course catalog. For courses with multiple offerings or sections, each course is counted as a single course, regardless of the number of offerings or sections. Courses offered as dual undergraduate/graduate courses are counted as two seperate courses. The current list was reviewed by the Associate Provost for Instruction and Interim Provost and Executive Vice President, then sent to ESF Department Chairs for further review, who worked with faculty members and the Sustainability Office on the classification of individual courses as appropriate. 
 
In compliance with STARS 2.0 reporting criteria, this list is made publicly available via the ESF registrar’s website (http://www.esf.edu/sustainability/courses.htm). Future assessments and updates of this list will be conducted by the Sustainability Office as part of regular STARS submissions, in consultation with ESF administrators, department chairs and faculty.

CURRICULUM
4         Undergraduate courses with a sustainability component
A.	Undergraduate courses with a sustainability component:
Course name: GSCI 140/141: Environmental Science and Lab, GSCI 150/151: The Geology of Climate Change and Energy, GCI 200: Environmental Geology, GSCI 335: Paleoclimatology
Brief course description: GSCI 140: An introduction to the interaction of humansand the natural world, with focus on global environments, resources, population dynamics, energy, geology, and human impacts. GSCI 141: An introduction to laboratory principles and techniques in the environmental sciences for the critical analysis of scientific methods through data collection, data analysis, and interpretation. 
	GSCI 150: This course is intended for non-science majors who have an interest in understanding the relationship between energy usage in the industrial era and climate change. Understanding and adapting to global-scale climate change is one of the most important issues facing scientists and world leaders in the 21st century. The interrelationship of past climate changes and energy consumption from fossil fuels is clear, and understanding the response of the Earth system to rising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is of critical interest as the human population approaches maximum sustainable levels. This course explores the fundamental geologic records of global climate change, Earth-system processes in the context of climate change and the global carbon cycle, critical improvements to the scientific understanding of natural verses human-induced climate change, and the recent and future impact of global-scale energy use on the Earth system. GSCI 151: This laboratory course is designed for nonscience majors. Weekly exercises explore the global carbon cycle, Earth-system processes, geologic records of climate change, national and global-scale consumption of hydrocarbon fuels, and the potential for renewable energy resources in western New York. 
	GSCI 200: A survey of important geologic concepts relevant to current environmental issues. Emphasis is placed on geologic principles underlying problems related to water resources, pollution, natural hazards, waste disposal, energy and mineral resources, and on the scientific bases for current strategies proposed to limit adverse consequences of our impact on environmental systems. The geologic information bases available from governmental agencies are used to characterize and demonstrate practical problems for classroom exercises. Although not required, a general survey course in geology, physical geography, or high school earth science would provide an appropriate background. 
	GSCI 335: The study of fundamental concepts of global scale environmental and climatic changes in the context of Earth-surface pchemical and biological signatures of past environments preserved in the geologic record; causes and effects of major climate changes over various timescales in Earth history; and geologic responses to Pleistocene, Holocene and historical climate change. Laboratory exercises involve characterizing surface processes, data-rich studies of climate- change records and discussions of climate science literature.
Number of times offered: each of these classes was offered once in 2014-15.  
Number of sections, if applicable: one section of each lecture class, 3 sections of GSCI 141 and six of GSCI 151. 
URL where syllabus is located: syllabi not posted online but can be provided.

The course listing was modified so that study abroad courses, internship courses, honors courses, technical courses, and research courses (independent and group studies, undergraduate and graduate research, thesis research and dissertation research) were excluded.

The course listing was evaluated first by conducting a comprehensive word search using 110 keywords that relate to any environmental, economic, or social component of sustainability as defined by the Earth Charter. The word search identified 5,586 courses that were evaluated further according to AASHE STARS criteria for sustainability courses and courses that include sustainability. The final selection of sustainability courses was reviewed and approved by the Sustainability Curriculum Ad-hoc Committee.

An initial list of all courses taught during all semesters of the 2014-2015 academic school year was obtained from the Registrars Office. The database was thoroughly reviewed to search for and identify potential sustainability courses by identifying courses that were indentured as sustainability related for the previous STARS submission, searching for the term ""sustainability"" in the course catalog, and reviewing specific courses within departments that are known to offer many sustainability related options. Once an initial list was generated, course titles and course descriptions were reviewed to identify to what extent a course was specifically a sustainability course or a course that included sustainability as a component. 

Additionally, results of the inventory were shared with all schools at the institution, and Deans and faculty were invited to provide ongoing input and updates.

To aid faculty members in self-identifying their courses, each year USI staff review all UBC courses (undergraduate and graduate) by course title and senate approved course description (and in some cases course outlines) to identify potential additions to the list. Each potential sustainability course is then assigned one or more of the three sustainability categories: Environment, Social, and Economy + Technology. The USI then conducts an email consultation with all faculty who teach these courses to: 1) confirm if the course should be on the sustainability course list, 2) to self-identify their course(s) as either Sustainability Course or Course that Includes Sustainability (as per AASHE STARS 2.0), and 3) confirm the assigned sustainability categories. The instructors will either confirm or reject the details of their current courses. Each course was only counted once regardless of multiple offerings and sections.

After the consultation, a comprehensive list is compiled each year. These courses are then tagged with the sustainability attributes (environmental, social, economy+technology) on the Faculty Service Centre (FSC), a central live course database. These courses are displayed on our website (http://sustain.ubc.ca/courses-teaching/courses) via a consistent feed to accurately display the most up-to-date data through the FSC. This list also features a search function to filter courses using key words (e.g., such as water, food, energy etc.) to assist students, staff, faculty, and community members interested in a particular issue to search the database.

",http://sustainability.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/02/2016-UCI-Sustainability-Course-Inventory.pdf,"SUSTAINABILITY COURSE INVENTORY METHODOLOGY (2016) 

The 2016 Sustainability Course Inventory presented in this section is an updated compilation of all sustainability courses and courses including sustainability that have been offered at UCI during the period from Winter 2013 through Spring 2016. 

In Fall 2011, the Manager of Special Projects in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administrative and Business Services at UCI compiled the initial list of environment and sustainability courses from the 2011-2012 UCI course catalog. In Winter 2012, the UCI Environment Institute convened a Sustainability Curriculum Assessment Team (SCAT) comprised of 15 student volunteers to apply the new faculty-established definition of sustainability in the curriculum to the previously compiled course list to distinguish courses that were sustainability-focused, sustainability-related, and not related to sustainability; these results were cross-checked against a preliminary sustainability curriculum assessment carried out by a 2007 Subcommittee of the UCI Sustainability Committee. In February 2013, the UCI Environment Institute re-assessed the 2012 sustainability course list by contacting each academic department to determine if the courses were currently offered and to identify new sustainability course offerings or ones that may have been missed in 2012.  In 2014 and 2015 the sustainability course inventories were again updated for the appropriate three-year period and to identify and evaluate any new course offerings. Reviews were completed by the Student Advisory Council on Sustainability Education (SACSE) under the direction of the Sustainability Initiative. 

The 2016 Sustainability Course Inventory reflects the re-assessment of courses reported in previous inventories as well as new courses approved by the Academic Senate. Academic courses that were offered at least once during the most recent three years (i.e., Winter 2013 through Spring 2016) were evaluated to determine if they qualified as sustainability courses or courses that contain sustainability. Undergraduate and graduate-level course inventories were compiled separately. 

The specific methodology used to identify for the 2016 Sustainability Course Inventory is summarized below:
•	All courses listed in the 2015 course inventory were reviewed: courses that had been listed in the 2015 sustainability inventory but were not offered in the past three years were eliminated. 
•	Courses that had been eliminated from the 2015 inventory were reviewed. If they had been eliminated because they had not been offered in the reviewed period but were offered in AY 2015-16, they were were added back into the inventory. Courses that had been eliminated from the 2014 inventory were similarly evaluated.  
•	A list of all newly approved or modified courses (January 2015 through January 2016) was provided by the University Registrar’s office and evaluated for this assessment based on the definitions provided in the STARS 2.0.1 Technical Manual. Courses that met the criteria for sustainability courses or courses that include sustainability were added to the inventory provided that they were offered in the established three-year time period. 
•	Courses that have been approved by the faculty advisory board for the interdisciplinary minor in Global Sustainability and the B.A. in Environmental Science, but not previously included in the sustainability course inventories, were reviewed. Provided that the courses had been offered during the three-year period, required courses were included in the inventory of sustainability courses, and approved electives were included in the inventory of courses that include sustainability. 
•	In 2015 the UCI Sustainability Initiative administered a survey to all faculty to identify any sustainability courses or courses that include sustainability that may have been missed. Identified courses that met the sustainability evaluation criteria were included in the inventory.
•	For the 2016 inventory, faculty on the Task Force for Sustainability Education (TFSE) were asked to review the 2015 course inventory and provide additions, edits, or deletions as appropriate. 

The UCI Office of Institutional Research compiled the total number of unique courses offered at UCI for each of the three academic years (Fall/Winter/Spring): AY2013-14, AY 2014-15, and AY2015-16. An average of the three academic years was used for the total number of courses offered annually by UCI over the three-year period. The Office of Institutional Research also compiled a list of all academic departments offering courses; departments may offer courses under more than one course code. Medical School courses were not included in the course inventory or the total course count; Medical School departments also were not included in the list of academic departments for reporting on this credit.

Each unique course was counted as a single course. Only primary courses were counted. Secondary courses (e.g., labs, discussions, independent study, etc.) were not included; field courses directly related to sustainability were included. Courses with multiple offerings within a year or courses that are offered annually were counted as one unique course over the three-year period. Courses with the same general number but with unique course designations (e.g., ESS 60A and ESS 60B, for which ESS 60A is a prerequisite) were counted individually. Courses cross-listed in multiple departments with unique course numbers were counted as separate courses. 
",Each course was counted as a single course regardless of the number of offerings or sections,"Description of how courses with multiple offerings or sections were counted is included in the methodology summarized above and copied below.

To identify the courses at UCLA that meet the above criteria we used a three-step process.  We first started with lists of courses that had been compiled in two previous efforts to catalog sustainability courses at UCLA.  We are very grateful to those who launched these initial efforts, especially Amy Hensley and Prof. Richard Ambrose, in 2007, and Zeta Yu-Peralta, in 2008.  Second, a team of dedicated and enthusiastic undergraduate interns was enlisted to augment these previous lists by scanning the entire UCLA Catalog for additional courses that might fit our criteria.  Third, the combined list was then reviewed, culled, and approved by members of the Academic Subcommittee. This list has been updated a number of times since then, a comprehensive update of the inventory is currently underway. For the previous version of STARS grad and undergrad courses were not separated out, so we have listed them all under undergraduate for now, but will be updating that data soon into two separate lists. Unfortunately it was not able to be ready for this years Sierra rating.  

Many of the courses on the list are “multiple-listed” courses, meaning the same course is listed as being offered by two or more different departments. We felt that listing all versions of a course was more comprehensive, more useful for students looking for courses, and better reflected the broad reach of sustainability courses at UCLA.

We recognize that, even after this comprehensive effort, the list likely contains errors.  We have made our best effort to be thorough in our identification of courses so as to make the list most useful for students seeking courses with substantial sustainability content.  We will continue to refine the list by adding or deleting courses as errors become known to us either through periodic reviews or feedback from students and faculty.

Curriculum

For the purposes of STARS, UCSB reported on any courses that addressed the interconnection between humans and environmental issues or solutions. To help us flush out this definition and fully understand for ourselves what this entails we developed a set of goals and outcome measures below.

Broad Definition of Sustainability Courses:

Goal Measures (Courses must identify one or more of the following goals):
1. Identifies one or more serious environmental problems and explain its underlying causes and possible consequences. 
2. Explores the conceptual foundations of our environmental attitudes, values and challenges from a variety of cultural perspectives.
3. Examines the scientific understanding of Earth’s natural systems and cycles, emphasizing humanity’s role as the planet’s ecologically dominant species and how that affects the continuing viability of habitats for life on Earth.
4. Demonstrates the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and social systems. 
5. Investigates how our relationship to the natural world has been shaped historically, politically, and/or economically.
6. Examines the controversies surrounding questions of values and ethics as they relate to creating a sustainable future.
In addition, it will be expected that at least one student learning outcome (SLO) is developed that reflects the focus of the course.

Outcome Measures (Students learning objectives):
1. Understand and be able to effectively communicate the concept of sustainability.
2. Analyze how the well-being of human society is dependent on ecosystems and the materials and services they provide to humanity.
3. Recognize the physical and biological attributes, basic functioning, and limits of planetary ecosystems.
4. Develop and use an ethical perspective in which they view themselves as embedded in the fabric of an interconnected world.
5. Become aware of and explore the connections between their chosen course of study and sustainability.
6. Synthesize understanding of social, economic, and environmental systems and reason holistically.
7. Be able to create models, products, designs or creative representations that highlight an understanding of the connections among people, processes and the environment.
",Each course was counted as a single course regardless of the number of offerings or sections,"Some related courses were cross-listed between departments. To account for this overlap, these courses were condensed into a single entry within the course inventory that included all possible course codes and departments. These cross-listed courses were only counted once, although the multiple departments under which they were listed were all counted as departments offering sustainability courses or courses that include sustainability. Similarly, courses that had both an undergraduate and graduate course code were condensed into a single listing that included both course codes. These courses were only counted once. No sections, including honors sections, were included.

If the course was offered multiple times over the three-year reporting period, it was counted only once. Courses with one course code, but varying subject matters, were only counted as one course. These courses were very difficult to track because they were taught differently each time they were offered, based on the Professor’s preference. Therefore, they were oftentimes excluded, unless it could be demonstrated that they were sustainability focused/related more than half of the times they were offered. An example of this occurring is with the courses offered through the Literature and the Environment Program within the English Department. Many of these courses didn’t count because the exact subject matter of the class fluctuates frequently, making precise data difficult to obtain.

The Deans sent out an email to their faculty and staff requesting that they review their department's offerings from this list of classes and identify those that fit the criteria of being a sustainability course or a course that includes sustainability (definitions and examples from technical manual were provided) and give a rationale for why a course was designated as either.

The Sustainability Office reviewed the department's response and when there was inconsistency between the faculty and staff categorization, they requested syllabi and/or talked to the instructor of the course in order to ascertain the degree to which sustainability played a role in the curriculum in order to make a final decision as to whether the course should be included and, if it was, how it should be categorized. 

The final list was shared with Departments and submitted to AASHE STARS.

We included practicums and internships if they had a course code and multiple students were enrolled for credit. An internship was not included if it had a course code associated with it but only represented one individual's internship (rather than a course that places multiple students in internships but meets regularly as a cohort).",Each offering or section of a course was counted as an individual course,"For each course that the Department of Institutional Research, Assessment & Policy Studies identified in our reporting period, they noted how many times it was offered for each academic year we were reporting on and we reported that number in total courses above.

STARS attempts to translate this broad and inclusive view of sustainability to measurable objectives at the campus level. Thus, it includes credits related to an institution’s environmental, social, and economic performance."" The Earth Charter (http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html) was also used as a framework in determining courses that were sustainability related and focused. Courses that were considered “focused” pertained mainly to the environment and dealt with sections from the Earth Charter such as “Protect and restore the integrity of Earth's ecological systems, with special concern for biological diversity and the natural processes that sustain life” and “Prevent harm as the best method of environmental protection and, when knowledge is limited, apply a precautionary approach.” Sections considered to be “related” did not pertain directly to the environment and embodied excerpts from the Earth Charter such as “Uphold the right of all, without discrimination, to a natural and social environment supportive of human dignity, bodily health, and spiritual well-being, with special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities and “Build democratic societies that are just, participatory, sustainable, and peaceful.”

The definition that UConn specifically uses for sustainability is from the Academic Plan.   
""...problems of environmental sustainability cannot be addressed solely by grasping the scientific principles that lead to technical solutions. Successful resolution also requires understanding their ethical, social, legal, economic, and cultural implications from a global perspective."" 

Other interns and sustainability coordinators from the OEP then went through all of the courses in the graduate and undergraduate catalogs eliminating internships, practicums, independent studies, special topics courses, thesis, dissertation, and capstone courses, clinical courses, physical education courses, and exclusively performance based courses (such as concert choir or marching band). All courses that are offered exclusively at one of the branch campuses (such as classes in Medical Science or Dental Science) were excluded as well, because those schools do not fall within the institutional boundary we report for this survey.  
",Each course was counted as a single course regardless of the number of offerings or sections,"However, courses that were cross-listed across multiple departments (with a prefix for each department) were counted for each department. For example, if a class is cross listed between Human Rights and Political Science, it is counted twice. We applied this rule to both sustainability courses and to all courses.

Analysis from SES was returned as a list of courses, which we then assigned to respective departments of record.

 The following methodology description was provided by SES:

This syllabi survey utilized the content analysis software, Nvivo. Syllabi were collected by the office of sustainability from the internet, and then provided to the analyst. Maintaining departmental and college information as attributes, the data were uploaded to the software. Key word searches were run on the text of every document using the following sustainability related terms: air quality, appropriate technology, community development, earth charter, ecology, ecological economics, environment, environmental, environmental economics, environmental justice, environmental politics, green building, green business, green design, limits to growth, millennium development goals, new urbanism, our common future, resilience, social capital, social justice, social wellbeing, soil quality, soil science, sustainability, sustainable, sustainable development, waste, and water quality. This list of key words was derived from the analyst’s last five years of research and development within the sustainability education literature and sustainability curricula in higher education. From the original dataset of 5,666 these word frequencies narrowed the list of potentially relevant courses to 3,000. Those courses with only a single hit on any of the key words were next examined, and irrelevant courses were eliminated. The remaining courses were renamed to correspond with their course number and course title, and then examined and qualitatively assessed to be either sustainability focused, sustainability related, or unrelated. The sample was scanned three times during this process, searching for courses that were fully focused on sustainability. The resultant sample includes 382 syllabi. 63 items were identified as sustainability focused. 319 were identified as sustainability related. Limitations of the study: further work could be done to identify sustainability focused (as opposed to merely related) courses within the existing sample; it is possible that other key words could identify additional sustainability related courses; a more rigorous collection of sustainability syllabi on campus could be achieved, but it was reasoned that efficiency of time and resource expenditures dictated that a long-term plan ensuring better access to syllabi warranted more attention than an exhaustive search for current offerings.

Additionally, the research team included courses from sustainability-focused degrees and academic programs. Each college was contacted individually to review the possible sustainability course offerings that the research team identified. Specifically, the staff in the Office contacted the dean, department chairs and faculty engaged in sustainability research or curriculum.* Some of the colleges and departments identified a liaison to review the course list, sent back the confirmed courses and added any additional courses that the Office staff missed.

In 2011, a survey was created by interior architecture professor  and campus sustainability leader Dr. Anna Marshall-Baker for UNCG faculty to identify their courses pertaining to or utilizing concepts of sustainability.  To guide respondents, the survey used UNCG's definition of sustainability: ""the enduring interconnectedness of social equity, the environment, economy, and aesthetics. This interconnectedness provides a foundation from which to discover, implement, and enrich sustainable principles and practice. The intent of sustainability is to instill values that promote justice, invent innovative approaches and solutions to environmental and economic challenges, and invest civility and grace into our communities."" Course descriptions, student learning outcomes, and sustainability content (by percentage) were all requested. The results were reviewed by two faculty members and the sustainability coordinator, and supplemented with an
inventory of the class descriptions in the course catalog.

In 2014, the faculty of the Environmental Studies Program voted to create a minor in sustainability.

Rather than come up with hard and fast rules that attempt to define sustainability, our philosophy is to err on the side of inclusivity and defer to faculty/staff definitions of sustainability. Below are some guiding questions provided to help determine if a particular course should be included in the Sustainability Directory.
Does this course:
-- Aim to better understand and lessen the negative impact of human activity on earth?
-- Teach or research methods of reducing our ecological footprint?
-- Work toward the continued health and well-being of the planet and future generations?
-- Teach or research on increasing social equity, environmental justice, or responsible global citizenship?
-- Focus on improving the quality of all life on earth?

Additionally, the topics used in the Sustainability Directory help shape the institution's definition of sustainability in academics.  These topics were chosen to reflect UT-Austin’s sustainability strengths and concentrations and were informed by other universities' efforts to categorize and communicate their sustainability-related offerings.  Final topics were ultimately chosen through an iterative process with key UT Austin stakeholders (faculty, staff, students, and community members) through meetings and focus groups.

The original inventory for the Sustainability Directory was generated by students from UT Austin's Campus Environmental Center, who hand-counted courses for the '09-'10 academic year. Geography department program coordinators reviewed a provisional list of courses in their department to confirm the courses' coverage of sustainability topics. Help was also provided from Energy & Earth Sciences.  Courses are added to and subtracted from the Directory as new and old courses are identified.

 Signature Questions
To build your intellectual curiosity, USP incorporates three broad Signature Questions that are woven throughout the Quests.

As an incoming student, you will begin to question in a discipline-based first-year experience (FYE) course while concurrently enrolled in a second course focused on the skills employers repeatedly name as the most crucial to success in the 21st century. Among these skills is the ability to write and speak effectively and to collaborate successfully with others. By enrolling in these paired courses during your first two semesters on campus, you are placed in small learning communities that begin to examine USP's Signature Questions.
How do people understand and create a more sustainable world?

Knowledge of Sustainability and Its Applications is the ability to understand local and global earth systems; the qualities of ecological integrity and the means to restore and preserve it; and the interconnection of ecological integrity, social justice and economic well-being.
How do people understand and engage in community life?

Civic Learning entails understanding political and nonpolitical processes that influence a local, state, national or global community and applying skills and strategies that can affect the life of a community in positive ways.
How do people understand and bridge cultural differences?

Intercultural Knowledge is the understanding of one's own culture as well as cultures beyond one's own; the recognition of the cultural values and history, language, traditions, arts and social institutions of a group of people; the ability to negotiate and bridge cultural differences in ways that allow for broader perspectives to emerge; and the skills to investigate a wide range of world views, beliefs, practices and values.
",http://www.uwosh.edu/usp/explore/explore-courses,"The Campus Sustainability Council of the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, which includes at least three faculty members who teach courses in different departments, adopted the definition of sustainability in the curriculum to guide sustainability course identification.  They also recommended applying a rubric developed by faculty working on General Education Reform.  The rubric included a matrix listing goals/competencies for three levels: Knowledge, Analysis, and Action.   

The Director of Sustainability, the Chancellor's Fellow on Sustainability, and student interns analyzed the syllabi available for courses taught in the 2010-2011 Academic Year and again in the years prior.  Some syllabi were not available for analysis because they were not posted online and faculty did not respond to repeated requests.  A complete listing of courses/sections offered was obtained from the Registrar. A table was constructed to document the syllabus analysis.  

The new general education program features sustainability as one of its main cross disciplinary focuses for every incoming freshman.

How can we understand environmental problems if we don't understand the environment? In this course, we will approach environmental issues as scientific investigators: What do we need to know in order to understand ozone depletion? Mercury pollution? Ocean acidification? Habitat degradation? These are complex issues that are distinct in many ways, but which often share fundamental concepts that draw from many scientific disciplines. By examining the science behind these problems, we will develop the skills required to address them and begin to build a toolbox to tackle new and different problems. Laboratories examine the relationship between humans and the environment by exploring the campus and beyond. We will investigate important issues through hands-on physical data collection, high tech analysis, and modeling/mapping. ES 101, ES 102, and 

ES 102 Environment and Society: Addressing Climate Change 
This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to environmental studies, with a focus on a climate change. Major concepts that will be examined include: the state of scientific research, the role of science, politics, and economics in environmental decisionmaking, and the importance of history, ethics and justice in approaching climate change. The central aim of the course is to help students develop the interdisciplinary research skills necessary to pose questions, investigate problems, and develop strategies that will help us address our relationship to the environment. 

ES 103 FYS: Environment and Society: Food, Agriculture, and Sustainability 
Where does our food come from? Is the way we grow, distribute, and consume it sustainable? What is the difference between organic and conventional agriculture? Are technologies, such as genetic modification, ethically defensible? How does our assessment change if we consider agriculture in a developing country in Africa? To answer these questions, students will take an interdisciplinary approach to environmental studies that draws on economics, politics, history,  ethics, and the sciences. Students will actively investigate these questions through activities such as hands-on research on a long-term agricultural research plot on campus, field trips to investigate practices at nearby farms, and policy-relevant debates in class. 

ES 201/GEOS 201 Environmental, Health, and Sustainability Sciences with Laboratory  more
Problems in environmental, health, and sustainability sciences are inherently transdisciplinary and require a diverse skill set to frame, analyze and solve. This course will focus on developing a toolbox of skills including; systems level thinking, field and analytical methods, biogeochemical analysis (natural waters, soils, and other environmental materials), and modeling with a goal of building a science-based foundation for the analysis of complex issues at the interface between humans and the environment. Students will conduct semester-long research projects and will present their results in a final poster session.

ES 203 Cultures of Environmentalism
What is environmentalism? This course explores how different communities of people have answered that question in the United States and abroad. It focuses on the mainstream environmental movement and other formulations of environmentalism, such as environmental justice, deep ecology, animal rights, and indigenous peoples' concerns for the environment. This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to examining the role of culture in shaping how people have valued the environment and organized to protect it. What role do the arts, popular culture, and literature play in environmental activism? What are the ethical and philosophical foundations of modern environmental movements? How is environmental activism historically specific and shaped by particular constructions of race, gender, religion, and nature? The goal of this course is to consider how environmental activism and decision making can and must be sensitive to cultural context. Students are required to undertake a 15-20 hour service-learning project with a Boston-area environmental group.

ES 209 Agroecology. The Science of Sustainable Food Systems with Laboratory 
Agricultural production is embedded within, and interacts with, ecological, economic, and social systems. How do we know what impact food production has on the ecosystem, farmers, consumers, and others? Agroecology is a field that applies ecological principles to agricultural systems, explores social implications of food systems, and seeks solutions to food production and distribution through quantitative and qualitative analysis. The objectives of this course are to understand the fundamentals of agroecology, learn research design techniques to test questions related to these fundamentals, and understand analytical tools that reflect a whole-systems approach to evaluating the food system. We will pair lectures and discussions in the classroom with research on local farms, including farmer interviews, farm mapping and analysis of ecological factors on the farm. 

ES 210/GEOS 210 Hydrogeology- Water and Pollutants with Laboratory
Clean water supply is a high priority for both developed and underdeveloped communities worldwide. Limits to supply and their implications for an increasing population make a clear understanding essential for citizens. Water sources and movement of water from the atmosphere through the earth's surface and subsurface will be examined. Laboratory will include field and laboratory analyses of physical and chemical properties and pollutant issues of local community supplies including the Wellesley campus, and Towns of Wellesley, Natick, and Norwell.

ES 212/RAST 212 Lake Baikal: The Soul of Siberia

Dist: Natural and Physical Science; Language and Literature

ES 214/POL2 214 Social Causes and Consequences of Environmental Problems  
Maps are more than a means of getting around - they have become vital tools for addressing some of the world's most pressing environmental, social, and public health problems. This course introduces students to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), a modern approach to spatial analysis that has opened up new ways to identify and predict complex interactions. Many problems have a spatial component, and GIS provides a common framework to understand complex patterns. GIS is used in diverse disciplines, from economics and sociology to biology and geosciences to understand issues such as environmental justice, human ecology, pollution, epidemiology, and biodiversity conservation. Students will learn how to analyze problems in a GIS environment. They will gain hands-on experience with spatial analyses and data visualization and develop conceptual tools for spatial and quantitative reasoning. The combined lecture/lab format of the course will guide students in how to design, execute and present original research using methods from this evolving and important field.

ES 219/ANTH 229 Mapping Society, Public Heath, and the Environment: GIS Approaches 
This course focuses on the social science explanations for why environmental problems are created, the impacts they have, the difficulties of addressing them, and the regulatory and other actions that succeed in mitigating them. Topics include: externalities and the politics of unpriced costs and benefits, collective action problems and interest group theory, time horizons in decision making, the politics of science, risk and uncertainty, comparative political structures, and cooperation theory. Also addressed are different strategies for changing environmental behavior, including command and control measures, taxes, fees, and other market instruments, and voluntary approaches. These will all be examined across multiple countries and levels of governance.

ES 220 Environmental Limits and Conservation with Laboratory 
The growing use of global resources challenges our ability to conserve resources themselves, as well as species, ecosystems, and environmental quality. This brings up fundamental questions regarding limits to the sustainability of human and natural systems. This course investigates these far-reaching concepts by examining topics such as fundamentals and implications of thermodynamics, energy and material flow through human and natural systems, conservation of resources and biodiversity, and natural resource management. We will also explore the role of science and technology in surmounting previous limits (e.g. energy consumption and agricultural yields), as well as the implications of inherent limits that may never be broken. Laboratory work will focus on quantitative skills and tools used to assess the sustainability of different systems.

ES 226 Archaeology of Environmental Change 
Modern concerns about climate change and human impacts on the environment are the most recent in a long history of human – environmental interactions. Closer attention to long-term human-environmental interactions shows we have a constant history of impacting environments —both subtle and profoundly—throughout the world. This class will examine such interactions from a long-term perspective spanning the past 10,000 years. Through case studies in Environmental Archaeology, we will examine notions of ―""pristine wildernesses"", how past cultural adaptations have created sustainable environments or caused environmental deterioration, and will scrutinize environmentally-driven models of societal change. With this focus on anthropogenic environments, we will look critically at models that externalize humans as ecological forces. We will also explore selected multidisciplinary approaches to reconstructing past human – environmental dynamics.

ES 228/ECON 228 Environmental and Resource Economics
This course considers the economic aspects of resource and environmental issues. After examining the concepts of externalities, public goods, and common property resources, we will discuss how to measure the cost and benefits of environmental policy, in order to estimate the socially optimal level of the environmental good. Applications of these tools will be made to air and water pollution, renewable and nonrenewable resources, and global climate. In addressing each of these problems we will compare various public policy responses such as regulation, marketable permits and tax incentives.

ES 229 Latin America: Topics in Food Systems and the Environment 
From an ecological perspective, Latin America is a vast region composed of numerous biomes: tropical forests, savannas, deserts, mountains, and temperate forests and grasslands. Culturally, this region is home to diverse human communities including 600 indigenous groups. Economically, many countries in Latin America depend upon the export of natural resources and agricultural products. Growing populations, increased global trade, and a complicated history of colonization put pressure on all of these areas, creating a fascinating and important backdrop for exploring issues in food systems and the environment. Topics will be guided by student interest, but may include food justice, agroecology, water rights, biodiversity conservation, biopiracy, transnational agreements, farmer networks and social movements.

ES 247/BISC 247 Plant Diversity and Ecology with Laboratory 
This course is a combination of ""What's that wildflower?"" and ""Why does it grow over there and not here?"" We begin by examining large-scale patterns of plant diversity from an evolutionary and phylogenetic perspective  and then shift to an ecological perspective. Along the way, we zoom in to specific concepts and processes that help us understand overall patterns. Laboratories will primarily be taught in the field and greenhouses and will include plant identification, observational and experimental studies, and long-term study of forest communities on the Wellesley campus. Laborities will also include aspects of experimental design and data analysis. The goal of the course is not only to train students in botany and plant ecology, but to engage them in the world of plants every time they step outside. 

ES 267/ARTH 267 Art and the Environmental Imagination 
Nature, according to the environmental historian William Cronon, ""serves as the mirror onto which societies project the ideal reflections they wish to see."" Focusing on the land of the United States as it has been shaped into forms ranging from landscape paintings to suburban lawns, national parks, and our own Wellesley College campus, we will investigate the social, political, economic, religious, scientific, and aesthetic imperatives that have underlain these creations and molded our responses to them. Among the questions we will consider are: What is ""nature""? What do we value in a landscape and why? How have artists and architects responded to environmentalist concerns? 

ES 289 Environmental Mapping and Analysis 
Today's maps are much more than a means to get from here to there—they are rich with information and have become vital tools for addressing some of the world's most pressing environmental problems. Modern spatial analysis and mapping methods, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), have opened up new ways to discover, interpret, and predict complex spatial patterns and systems. This course offers students hands-on experience with state-of-the-art spatial tools, statistical analyses, and data visualization in order to study multidisciplinary topics such as environmental justice, natural resource management/economics, environmental pollution, and biodiversity conservation. The combined lecture/lab format of the course in addition to its two instructors provides a thorough immersion into an evolving and exciting field.

ES 299 Environmental History 
This course examines the relationship between nature and society in American history. The course will consider topics such as the decimation of the bison, the rise of Chicago, the history of natural disasters, and the environmental consequences of war. There are three goals for this course: First, we will examine how humans have interacted with nature over time and how nature, in turn, has shaped human society. Second, we will examine how attitudes toward nature have differed among peoples, places, and times and we will consider how the meanings people give to nature inform their cultural and political activities. Third, we will study how these historical forces have combined to shape the American landscape and the human and natural communities to which it is home. While this course focuses on the past, an important goal is to understand the ways in which history shapes how we understand and value the environment as we do today.

ES 300 Environmental Decisionmaking 
An interdisciplinary seminar in which students work together in small groups to understand and develop solutions for current environmental problems. Each year, we focus on a given environmental issue of concern to our community, e.g. environmental implications of building design, energy use, or water quality. In particular, we work to understand its scientific background, the political processes that lead to potential solutions, and the ethical and environmental justice implications. Student-led research provides the bulk of the information about the issue and its role in our local environment; lectures and readings provide supplementary information about the local situation and the global context.

ES 307/BISC 307 Advanced Topics in Ecology with Laboratory 
Topic for 2015-16: Freshwaters: Ecology & Conflicts. Freshwater ecosystems support a myriad of fascinating biota, many with links to the terrestrial realm, and are essential sustainers of human societies. Increasingly, freshwaters are threatened with multi-source pollution, and diversion to industry and agriculture. What is the fate of freshwater resources as the human population surges toward 9 billion or more by 2050? How will humanity cope with impending water shortages as climate change proceeds? And, what of the freshwater biota? Through discussions of the primary literature and student research presentations, we will explore the effects on freshwater ecosystems of climate change, pollutants, invasive species, and water use policy, as well as the societal implications of such challenges. From a local perspective, we'll sample several New England freshwater ecosystems to study their current richness and temporal dynamics, as a baseline for future change.

ES 312S/POL2 312S Seminar: Environmental Policy 

ES 313 Environmental Impact Assessment   
Our environment is constantly changing as a result of anthropogenic events; we can apply scientific principles and assessment tools to reduce the adverse impacts that our actions have on the environment. Environmental impact assessment is the systematic identification and evaluation of the potential impacts or effects of proposed projects, products, and decisions relative to the current state of the total environment. This course teaches the scientific fundamentals of environmental impact assessment, along with the related approaches of environmental risk assessment, life cycle assessment and industrial ecology, that can help us make informed choices about how to minimize environmental harm and make informed choices about alternatives. These tools will be applied to case studies in class, and a semester-long team project.

ES 325/POL3 325 International Environmental Law 
For international environmental problems, widespread international cooperation is both important and quite difficult. Under what conditions have states been able to cooperate to solve international environmental problems? Most international efforts to address environmental problems involve international law—how does such law function? What types of issues can
international environmental law address and what types can it not? This course addresses aspects of international environmental politics as a whole, with particular attention to the international legal structures used to deal with these environmental problems. Each student will additionally become an expert on one international environmental treaty to be researched throughout the course.

ES 327/BISC 327 Seminar. Topics in Biodiversity  
Topic of 2015-16: Conservation Biology. This course will examine biological communities along a gradient from natural ecosystems to the built environment. What can we learn by applying concepts from community ecology to human-dominated landscapes? How important is biodiversity in urban and suburban settings, and how is human health connected to the biological communities we inhabit? Students will discuss primary literature, explore and describe a range of biological communities on and around campus, and, as a final projectm design small-scale ecosystems (aka gardens, indoors or out, terrestrial or aquatic).

ES 347/BISC 347 Advanced Plant Diversity and Ecology with Laboratory  
This course meets along with ES 247/BISC 247 and offers an opportunity for students to engage more deeply with the material and perform independent research. Students will be expected to more thoroughly review and reference peer-reviewed literature and assist in leading in-class discussions. Additionally, each student will develop and conduct an experiment (or observational study) over the course of the semester that examines mechanisms of plant diversity and coexistence.

ES 381/POL1 381 United States Environmental Politics 
This course examines the politics of environmental issues in the United States. The course has two primary goals: First, to introduce students to the institutions, stakeholders, and political processes important to debates over environmental policy at the federal level. Second, to develop and practice skills of analyzing and making decisions relevant to environmental politics and policy. Drawing on the literature of environmental politics and policy, this course will consider how environmental issues are framed in political discourse, various approaches to environmental advocacy and reform, and the contested role of science in environmental politics. The course will be organized around environmental case studies, including endangered species conservation, public lands management, air and water pollution, and toxics regulation.

ES 383 The Science of Compliance 
For more than 40 years U.S. environmental policies have been passed, amended and enforced with the purpose of protecting human health and preserving the environment. This course will examine the evolution of technologies to meet the goals of major U.S. environmental policies including the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act and the role that available technologies play in setting the enforceable standards within policies. We will learn fundamental scientific principles of water treatment, wastewater treatment, and air pollution control technologies and examine how scientists and engineers employ these technologies to meet policy goals. Students will further examine the relationship between a recent or future environmental policy and technological evolution.

ES 399 Calderwood Seminar in Public Writing: Environmental Synthesis and Communication more
Tax carbon? Label genetically modified crops? Ban endocrine disruptors? In this course, we will engage with such questions and related environmental sustainability issues as public writers. Students will choose one environmental issue, which will be the focus of their environmental “beat” during the semester. They will draw on an interdisciplinary toolset from environmental
studies to analyze and communicate the scientific, economic, political, and ethical dimensions of pressing policy issues. Students will conduct independent research to produce weekly articles, such as op-eds, blog posts, press releases, book reviews, policy memos, and interviews with environmental professionals. Class sessions will be organized as writing workshops focused on the interdisciplinary analysis and content of student work.

AFR 226 Environmental Justice, ""Race,"" and Sustainable Development  
An investigation of the extent to which the causes and consequences of environmental degradation are influenced by social inequality and the devaluation of indigenous peoples. The course will examine how the poor, indigenous peoples and people of color are subjected to environmental hazards. Topics include the link between negative environmental trends and social inequality; the social ecology of slums, ghettos and shanty towns; the disproportionate exposure of some groups to pollutants, toxic chemicals, and carcinogens; dumping of hazardous waste in Africa and other Third World countries; and industrial threats to the ecology of small island states in the Caribbean. The course will evaluate Agenda 21, the international program of action from the Earth Summit designed to halt environmental degradation and promote sustainable development.

ASTR 223/GEOS 223 Planetary Climates 
Have you wondered what Earth's climate was like 3 billion years ago? What about weather patterns on Titan and climate change on Mars? In this course, we'll explore the structure and evolution of atmospheres and the climate on four worlds: the Earth, Mars, Venus, and Saturn's moon Titan. We'll examine the techniques and tools that geologists use to learn about the history of the Earth's climate and that planetary scientists use to learn about the atmospheres and surface environments on other worlds. Students will also gain experience simulating the climate system and computing atmospheric properties. Other topics include: the super-rotation of Venus's atmosphere and its Runaway Greenhouse climate, the destruction of atmospheres on low-gravity worlds, and the future of Earth's climate as the Sun grows steadily brighter.

ASTR 323: Advanced Planetary Climates
This course meets with ASTR 223/GEOS 223 (see description) and on alternate Wednesdays for additional instruction and seminar-style discussions exploring special topics in planetary climates. Students will read and discuss journal articles and advanced texts, and will produce a final project that involves an in-depth treatment of a topic of their choosing. Possible topics include: atmospheric escape mechanisms, physics of planetary exospheres, the anti-greenhouse and methane cycle on Titan, planetary global climate models, structure of the Venusian atmosphere, modern ice ages on Mars, evolution of the early Martian climate, spacecraft instrumentation, and remote sensing techniques.

BISC 108 Environmental Horticulture with Laboratory  
This course will examine how plants function, both as individual organisms and as critical members of ecological communities, with special emphasis on human uses of plants. Topics will include plant adaptations, reproduction, environmentally sound landscape practices, urban horticulture, and the use of medicinal plants. The laboratory involves extensive use of the greenhouses, experimental design, data collection and analysis, and field trips.

BISC 201 Ecology with Laboratory 
An introduction to the scientific study of interactions between organisms and their environments. Topics include evolutionary adaptation in dynamic environments, behavioral ecology and life-history strategies, population growth and regulation, species interactions (competition, parasitism, mutualism, predation) and their consequences, and the structure and function of biological communities and ecosystems. Emphasis is placed on experimental ecology and its uses in addressing environmental issues such as biological control of pests, conservation of endangered species and global climate change. Laboratories occur primarily in the field where students explore and study local habitats, including meadows, forests, alpine tundra, bogs, dunes, marshes, lakes, and streams.

BISC 202 Evolution with Laboratory
Examination of evolution, the central paradigm of biology, at the level of populations, species, and lineages. Topics include the genetics of populations, the definition of species, the roles of natural selection and chance in evolution, the reconstruction of phylogeny using molecular and morphological evidence, and patterns in the origination, diversity, and extinction of species over time.

BISC 210 Marine Biology with Laboratory
Oceans cover more than 70% of the earth's surface and are our planet's primary life support system. This course examines adaptations and interactions of plants and animals in a variety of marine habitats. Focal habitats include the photic zone of the open ocean, the deep-sea, subtidal and intertidal zones, estuaries, and coral reefs. Emphasis is placed on the dominant organisms, food webs, and experimental studies conducted within each habitat. Laboratories will emphasize primarily field work in marine habitats as well as hands-on study of marine organism and adaptation anatomy.

BISC 308 Tropical Ecology with Laboratory  
Tropical rain forests and coral reefs seem to invite superlatives. They are among the most fascinating, diverse, productive, but also most endangered ecosystems on earth. These topics are addressed during the fall lectures in preparation for the laboratory part of the course which takes place in Central America during wintersession. We first travel to a small island part of an atoll bordering the world's second longest barrier reef off the coast of Belize. In the second half of the field course we explore an intact lowland rain forest in Costa Rica. Laboratory work is carried out primarily outdoors and includes introductions to flora and fauna, and implementation of research projects designed during the fall. Normally offered in alternate years. Subject to Dean's Office approval.

BISC 314 Environmental Microbiology and Laboratory
A field-based exploration of the microbial world centered on distinct microbial habitats visited locally. Short lectures and readings from primary literature will be combined with trips to visit a diverse set of microbial environments where students will collect samples for microbial isolation as well as culture-independent community assessment. In the laboratory, students will learn how to identify and design media for selective isolation of microbes involved in processes such as: methanotrophy, sulfur oxidation, nitrogen fixation, syntrophism and symbiosis, fermentation of ethanol and aging of cheese. Student participation and discussion of original scientific literature will be emphasized.

BISC 319 Evolution and Conservation Genetics with Laboratory
Oceanic archipelagos such as Galápagos stand at a crossroads: while many still retain most of its original species, ecological degradation is proceeding rapidly. We will focus on the study of the components of accumulation of species diversity in island systems and of the forces or agents that can threaten that endemic diversity. By looking at relationships between organisms, populations and species, we can interpret how historical processes can leave evolutionary footprints on the geographic distribution of traits. Additionally, analyzing genetic patterns within island populations we can detect signals of demographic growth or decline and evaluate the role of genetic factors in population persistence. After a series of introductory lectures, the course will involve student presentations and discussion of primary literature examining cases in archipelagos (Hawaii, Canaries and Galápagos). In the laboratory, we will explore computational biology tools for analysis of DNA sequences, and apply methods of phylogeny, phylogeography reconstruction and population demographics. We will also explore the growing field of molecular dating of evolutionary events.

GEOS 101 Earth Processes and the Environment with Laboratory
Geologic processes both rapid (earthquakes and landslides) and slow (mountain building and sea level rise) are intimately linked with sustaining the diversity of life on the planet. This course will examine these and other processes in which the atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere are linked via the flow of energy and mass. Laboratory exercises and field trips will introduce skills needed to observe and document processes shaping our environment. Problem solving in small groups during class time will foster critical thinking, and classroom debates between larger teams will focus research and communications skills on current issues in geosciences such as building and removing dams, and the science surrounding global climate change.

GEOS 102 The Dynamic Earth with Laboratory 
The Earth is a dynamic planet - driven by processes that operate on its surface and within. In this course we study these processes as well as interactions between the solid earth, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere that together produce the environment we live in. Topics covered include the origin and history of the earth, plate tectonics, the distribution of earthq [TRUNCATED]",http://www.wellesley.edu/environmentalstudies/curriculum/courses/all-es-courses,The course catalogue was reviewed by staff from the Environmental Studies Program and the Office of Sustainability. ,Each course was counted as a single course regardless of the number of offerings or sections,,--,--,True,True,True,--,--,--,**,--,--,--
