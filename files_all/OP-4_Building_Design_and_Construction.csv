Less extensive renovations shall utilize the LEED for Commercial Interiors (LEED-CI) rating system as applicable to their defined scope of work.  For example, a project that is exclusively painting might only be eligible for a single LEED point under the Low-Emitting Materials, Paints and Coatings section of the LEED-CI rating system and  would be expected to meet the requirements for that point.  As the scope of a project broadens, associated sections of LEED-CI would come into play.","By contract with the university, Design Consultants apply university Design and Construction Standards to their work on university projects. 

If Design Consultants identify circumstances in which, in their professional opinion, either the university or their internal customers or their projects themselves would be better served by waiving the application of any aspect of the Design and Construction Standards, they must seek  formal approvals to continue with design services that do not apply certain of those Design and Construction Standards to their work.

To obtain such waivers, Design Consultants are asked to put their requests in writing addressed to their university Project Manager (PM) assigned to their projects.  PMs submit these written applications for waivers to the Director of Design in the university’s Campus Design and Facilities Development (CDFD) organization, or to the University Engineer in the university’s Facilities Management Services (FMS) organization, or to both (depending on the nature of each proposed waiver) for review and response.  Copies of waiver requests also go to the Associate Vice Provost (Associate VP) for CDFD, to the PM’s supervisor (the Director of Construction for CD&FD), and to Customer Representatives (CRs) for the projects involved.

The Director of Design in the University's CD&FD organization or University Engineer or both approve or reject waiver applications in writing and transmit them to the PM, with copies to the Design Consultant, to the Associate VP for CD&FD, to the supervisor and to the CR.  Design Consultants or CRs may appeal rulings on waiver applications to the Associate VP.

The Associate VP reviews appeals of proposed waivers and either approves or denies them, with advice from the PMs and the supervisor, and from other interested parties not directly involved in the appeal.  Associate VP decisions are put in writing and transmitted to the appellant (Design Consultant or CR), with copies to the other interested party and to the University Architect/Engineer, to the PM, and to the supervisor.

As a part of signing the President’s Climate Commitment in 2007, GMC plans to reduce our environmental impact during College new construction. The College strives to create a built environment in which we work and live that applies our ecological mission while drawing upon the highest standards in sustainable design.
 
Policy
This policy applies to all new construction as defined by the USGBC:
·         All new construction will be implemented to be equal to the US Green Building Council’s LEED Silver, or better.
·         All new construction will be LEED Silver certified or better, when financially feasible.
·         All new construction will prioritize the use of recycled, local, healthy, natural, and environmentally sound materials.
·         Considering our region, in which heating is a primary use of energy, specific attention will be placed on issues associated with thermal efficiency and reduced energy consumption.
·         When envisioning a new construction project, the design team is encouraged to consider criteria set forth by The Living Building Challenge and Passive House design guidelines.
·         Preference will be given to local contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers.
 
Exemptions
Campus buildings such as the barns at the farm and those buildings used for machinery storage for landscape and other infrastructure are officially exempt from this policy, but any projects on these buildings are highly encouraged to follow sustainable building practices.
 
Implementation
A Green Building committee will oversee this policy, consisting of students, staff and faculty, which will be established when needed, to ensure that the policy objectives are being implemented. This committee will consider the complete life cycle of materials used, the long-term environmental and social effects resulting from changes in our campus environment, and the financial aspect of construction. Building professionals will be responsible for providing documentation ensuring building practices meet the standards of this policy.
 
Definitions
LEED: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is a rating system developed by the US Green Building Council, which provides standards for environmentally sound building practices and is used to determine the overall environmental performance of a building over its entire life cycle.
 
The Living Building Challenge is initiated by The Living Building Institute www.ilbi.org, which aims to encourage a holistic approach to new construction. It addresses a broad array of issues including ecological systems as well as the built environment.
 
Passive House design guidelines www.passivehouse.us/passiveHouse/PHIUSHome.html primarily address the solar design and the building envelope, including insulation values and infiltration.

The Harvard Green Building Standards were last updated in 2014, building upon the 2007 Green Building Guidelines and 2009 Green Building Standards. The 2014 version of the Standards include healthy material requirements for the disclosure of health and environmental impacts of products that are used on campus in order to help Harvard assess opportunities to understand the community’s exposure to potential toxins. They also include requirements for analyzing the feasibility of Net-Zero and Living Building Challenge certification for major capital projects and special considerations for laboratories and data centers, the most energy-intensive spaces on campus. Additional updates include a requirement for LEED v4 Gold certification, energy reduction targets beyond ASHRAE 90.1-2010, and revisions to Measurement and Verification standards that are used to assess the effectiveness and performance of energy and mechanical systems

In addition to these updated requirements and recommendations, the Standards require:
Integrated design goal-setting charrettes with all key stakeholders
Multiple iterations of energy models
Life cycle cost analysis

Prescriptive requirements such as aggressive energy and water reduction targets.
To support successful implementation of the Standards, Harvard has developed a set of tools and resources including: The Green Building Resource knowledge sharing website with LEED case studies and documentation; a University-specific Life Cycle Cost Calculator, Green Revolving Fund, and in-house Green Building Services consultant services.","Compliance with the Green Building Standards is reviewed as part of Harvard's larger capital project planning, review and approval process.",http://www.energyandfacilities.harvard.edu/green-building-resource,--

New buildings would use sustainability design features such as roofs covered with white reflective material to reflect the sun’s heat and reduce demand for air conditioning and
window systems to reduce heat gain and loss. All new buildings, and existing buildings undergoing major renovations, would be integrated into the Campus Energy Management System, which monitors and controls buildings’ heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and lighting systems to attain energy efficiency and optimize performance.

In the past decade, MIT has made considerable progress in constructing its new buildings with many sustainable features.  The Department of Facilities maintains a comprehensive list of additional information on current and planned construction projects. Examples of recent building projects include:

The Sloan School of Management building (E62), was completed in 2010 and is LEED Gold certified. Post occupancy studies show that the building is meeting aggressive energy efficiency targets, using about 45% less energy than a typical building of a similar size that simply meets code requirements. The building incorporates a high-performance envelope with operable windows in office areas, (partial) green roof, low-wattage lighting, demand ventilation, occupancy sensor controls, water-based terminal heating and cooling units, and easy access to usable outdoor spaces. Read more about the design and operation of the building here.
The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Institute, completed in Fall 2010, is MIT’s first LEED Gold certified research lab. The project demonstrates the viability of combining sustainability and scientific function in building design and operation. Reports confirm that the building is using 35 percent less energy than a standard laboratory research building. Designing an energy efficient ventilation system was a priority; Koch has over a hundred fume hoods that flush contaminated air away from researchers, which are a major source for energy consumption. To learn about more about Koch’s sustainable features, read here. Other sustainable design features include: redevelopment of a brownfield site, a reflective roof, and a storm water filtration system. 
Ashdown House (NW35) is a LEED Gold certified graduate residence hall completed in 2008 that houses more than 400 students. The building received LEED Gold certification in 2009 and includes many sustainable design features including light pollution reduction, Energy Star appliances, nontoxic materials.: landscaping and irrigation systems that use water from a non-potable source; a storm-water management system that reduces storm-water runoff; maximized daylight available in 95 percent of regularly occupied spaces; and low-flow fixtures that reduce water use by more than 20 percent. Read more here.
MIT’s Brain and Cognitive Science Complex is the world's largest center for neuroscience research, opened in 2005 and received LEED Silver certification in 2008. Sustainable features include: a high-performance building envelope, gray water reuse, exhaust-fan heat recovery, and daylight-balanced lighting. Read more here.
The iconic Stata Center, completed in 2004, has an innovative storm water management system, displaced ventilation systems, and a roof design that uses native vegetation and a white reflective surface to reduce the heat island effect.

The AJLC was one of the first and most innovative green buildings on a college campus. It helped launch the green building movement of the mid 1990s and its innovative systems have since inspired green buildings in many other locations and settings. In 2010, Architect Magazine polled 150 green building experts and named the AJLC the top green building built since 1980.

The Living Machine processes wastewater into reusable grey water via the natural cleansing methods that occur in a wetland—plants, bacteria, protozoa, and other aquatic microorganisms are used to clean and condition the water for reuse. It is located in the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies, and it is operated by a group of about 10 students. The Living Machine provides excellent opportunities for Oberlin College students and the community to explore issues of wastewater, wetland ecology, microbiology and plant dynamics.

With the installation of a new solar parking pavilion adjacent to the existing photovoltaic (PV) array on the roof of the innovative AJLC, Oberlin had the largest PV array in Ohio at the time, with a total rated production of 159 kW. By using the solar energy produced by the PV array, the college produces most of the electricity needed for the building.

In the fall of 2006 a group of students brought the idea of a sustainable living theme house called SEED — that is, Student Experiment in Ecological Design to the administration. The first phase of renovations were conducted in the summer of 2007 and students moved into the house in fall ’07. The house accommodates a total of eight students and is designed to spread the advantages of sustainable living into the local community. The SEED House is across from the Allen Art Museum at 20 and 22 E. Lorain St.

In addition, Stanford’s new buildings are now being designed to meet a whole-building, energy performance target. The target is unique to each new building, but based on performance of existing campus buildings of the same space type. Each new building is targeted to perform better than the peer buildings that were built before it.

Brief project notes for new buildings can be found online on the Department of Project Management website (http://lbre.stanford.edu/dpm/our_projects). Only projects completed within the past three years were included.

Stanford has invested significant resources over the last several years in building out its Arts district, which includes buildings focused on the mindset of the user inside, from museums, such as the new Anderson Collection and the new McMurtry Building, to contemplative centers like Windhover Pavilion. Windhover is a contemplative center located in the heart of campus. The building is accessible by ID card to Stanford students, staff and faculty. Art by Nathan Oliveira inspired both its name and its construction. Windhover, an elegant and natural space, was designed by Aidlin Darling Design, a San Francisco architectural firm. Uniting the artist’s aesthetic and the artworks themselves, the building reflects a keen understanding of the mission. Its simple lines communicate a design for meditative thought. The team at Aidlin Darling felt that even the approach to the building should contribute to the contemplative process. Approaching the space, one is guided alongside the building, with only glimpses of the interior revealed. As visitors move forward, elements of nature surround them. At the rear of the building, a reflection pond offers light and expansive windows afford a range of views of the art. Filtered light floods the site, creating a beautifully balanced atmosphere. Corten steel, rammed earth walls, stone, glass, and water are brought together to deepen the natural feeling, immersing visitors in a calm state.","Title-24, California's Green Building Standards, and Santa Clara County all set sustainability standards with which Stanford must comply. In order to comply with these standards, a LEED-NC equivalency analysis is performed on each new building project and submitted to appropriate jurisdictions. On every project, Stanford allocates budget to include high-efficiency transformers, and sophisticated energy management systems.  

Stanford's Department of Project Management (http://dpm.stanford.edu) is responsible for the development, design and construction of major capital projects at Stanford University. DPM reports to the Associate Vice President for Academic Projects and Operations within Land, Buildings, and Real Estate, and currently includes a staff of 28 professionals with backgrounds in architecture, engineering, construction and cost management. These professionals serve as Project Managers and Project Engineers, Quality Assurance Field Inspectors, and Project Coordinators, who work as a project team that involves multiple stakeholders to ensure the successful delivery of facilities that support the University’s academic mission. Together with its colleagues in the departments of Sustainability and Energy Management (http://sem.stanford.edu) and Buildings and Ground Maintenance (http://bgm.stanford.edu), DPM strives to employ life cycle cost analysis and sustainability measures in the delivery of all capital projects.

http://maps.stanford.edu/fdg_available",http://sustainable.stanford.edu/guidelines,"Please note that Stanford does not have a blanket policy that requires LEED certification, but rather guidelines with equivalent standards and an emphasis on prioritizing selection of the most appropriate high-performance features for a particular building function. The decision of whether or not to seek formal certification lies with the particular school or department for whom the new building is intended. For the majority of new construction in the past three years, the decision was made not to pursue certification under LEED-NC, and instead, to put the money that would have been spent on certification towards more sustainability features. It is estimated that Stanford would have spent $1.2 million in order to obtain LEED certification of all the new buildings within the last three years. Rather than paying consultants, contractors, and USGBC fees, Stanford used that funding to incorporate sustainability features such as heat recovery, HVAC systems, PV installations, rainwater storage systems, enhanced building controls, and water cooled (instead of air cooled) chillers into its building portfolio. These significant features within Stanford's high-performance buildings add value without formal certification, which merely increases the cost of the overall project. By taking potential certification fees and putting them back into its projects, Stanford can leverage its resources to achieve a real and quantitative impact instead of a plaque and accolade."

As environmental stewards, Sterling believes that renovated structures and building very few new structures with only locally harvested materials is more beneficial to the environment and community than obtaining third party verification and certification. 

Sterling College has committed to this practices in it's strategic plan. Included below are statements from the 2013-2018 Strategic Plan:

""Sterling College will have well-maintained facilities appropriate to the aspirations of our community, our curriculum, and our values including environmental stewardship. To sustain such a campus will require that the College develop adequate funds to maintain and repair its facilities, equipment, tools, and other physical resources. The campus will be integrated into the community of Craftsbury Common and will present an appealing appearance to our neighbors with whom we will seek to share our resources.

Specifically, the College will endeavor to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and will commit to increasingly live by its commitment to environmental stewardship.

Goal: To restore and renovate the campus so that all buildings are efficient and attractive and serve the needs of the community and a population of approximately 120 students.""","As with building operations and maintenance, Sterling College's governance mostly purchases used buildings and renovates them. When new buildings are constructed, materials are harvested on site and planned so that the least amount of non-local resources are used as possible. ",--,--

TECHNICAL GUIDELINES
http://technicalguidelines.ubc.ca/technical/sustainability.html
UBC started incorporating green building requirements into its Technical Guidelines, which are mandatory for all institutional new construction and major renovations, in 2002. The Guidelines are improved for sustainable design annually. 

LEED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
http://sustain.ubc.ca/sites/sustain.ubc.ca/files/uploads/CampusSustainability/CS_PDFs/GreenBuildings/UBCLEEDImplementationGuideline_20130424.pdf
Since 2008, the Province of BC has required all public sector new construction and major renovations to be certified LEED Gold. In 2013 UBC developed a LEED Implementation Guide which aims to help project teams achieve certification on campus and mandates certain LEED credits that align well with UBC policy. One of the most important mandatory LEED credits is achieving a minimum energy performance threshold (42% below Canada's Model National Energy Code for Buildings). 

UBC SUSTAINABILITY PROCESS
http://sustain.ubc.ca/sites/sustain.ubc.ca/files/uploads/CampusSustainability/CS_PDFs/GreenBuildings/Green-building_Enhanced-sustainability-process_Jan2015.pdf
To encourage sustainable and integrated green building design, UBC requires that design teams follow the UBC Sustainability Process for major academic projects.  Key aspects of the process are the development of project social, economic and environmental sustainability goals with stakeholders (including an energy use intensity target).  UBC also holds a series of sustainability workshops for each project to ensure the sustainability goals are fully explored in the building design.

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:

RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM (REAP)
http://sustain.ubc.ca/campus-initiatives/green-buildings/reap
UBC created its own Residential Environmental Assessment Program (REAP) in 2006. REAP is a green building rating system that is mandatory for all multifamily units built in the neighbourhoods at UBC. 
","UBC is the owner, developer and regulator for buildings on campus and uses this unique circumstance to help ensure compliance with green building design and construction guidelines. The department of Sustainability and Engineering (Campus + Community Planning) provides clearance prior to the issuance of each development, building or occupancy permit, providing check-in points to ensure compliance with green building standards. 

The Development Review Committee meets with the project developers and designers prior to the project’s development permit submission to help them understand the green building policies in place and the specific requirements in effect for each project.
",http://sustain.ubc.ca/campus-initiatives/green-buildings,"UBC completed construction or underwent major renovations of 16 buildings totaling 2,489,177 square feet during the previous 5 years (2010-2014). Five of these buildings have been LEED certified and are included in the certified floor space total.  Three more buildings are LEED registered and pending certification.

In total, UBC has 10 LEED certified buildings, constructed between 2004-2014. An additional 8 buildings are LEED registered and under construction, expected to be complete between 2015 and 2017. These buildings are all targeting LEED Gold or Platinum.

Approximately 1.6 million of the 2 million SF constructed/renovated were related to large projects (including construction of two new garages).  The remaining constructed/ renovated area is comprised of many smaller projects.  Due to the number of small projects, it was not feasible to review each individual project to determine whether the space met the ""minimum program requirements.""  For the purposes of STARS reporting, the total square feet constructed/renovated was therefore conservatively assumed to be ""eligible"" space.  By assuming all of the space was eligible the resulting STARS score for this credit may be underestimated.

The University of New Hampshire Planning, Design and Construction Guidelines are intended to provide general instructions to designers in the planning and preparation of construction documents, as well as general guidance to construction professionals working on projects for the University.  The purpose is to ensure a minimum standard of quality, durability, consistency, maintainability, and sustainability in building and infrastructure design and construction. The information collected here clarifies what is unique or different about construction at the University as compared to other projects that designers and contractors typically work on. 

The Guidelines are a baseline that allow for the introduction of new methods, systems, and materials for consideration by the University due to specific constraints, opportunities, or conditions of a specific project.  It is expected that any alternatives will be proposed before the completion of Design Development. The documents are not to be used as specifications for projects, but are to be incorporated, as appropriate, into the specifications for each University project. Nothing in The Guidelines shall preclude or take precedence over compliance with applicable codes, regulations, requirements, mandates, or laws of the State of New Hampshire or the federal government.  This is intended to be a living document that evolves through continual review and updates as needed.  The Guidelines will be made available by Web access and it is expected that designers will utilize the latest version available at the time a project proceeds with Schematic Design.

WHILE EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO MAKE THE GUIDELINES COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE, THERE ARE ALWAYS ELEMENTS THAT NEED FURTHER CLARIFICATION OR THERE IS NEW INFORMATION THAT HAS YET TO BE INCLUDED.  THE GUIDELINES DO NOT RELIEVE THE DESIGNERS FROM THE RESPONSBILITY TO PROVIDE COMPLETE, ACCURATE, AND QUALITY CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS TO MEET OUR NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS.

The UNH Planning, Design and Construction Guidelines is organized in chapters that follow the sequence of the project process.  Chapter 1, General Principles, addresses several planning guides or master plans that describe the University’s design goals and intentions.  Chapter 2, Project Process, provides requirements for developing a typical project and the products that are expected along the way.  Chapter 3, University Planning Standards, delineates the University’s expectations and considerations for some of the major design elements and functions of most projects.  Chapter 4, Supplemental Project Requirements (under development), contains information on specific protocols and processes unique to the University environment. Chapter 5, Technical Construction and Renovation Standards, is a constant resource to designers from Design Development through the completion of Construction Documents and Specifications.  It is organized in the CSI format. 

The University of New Hampshire has made a commitment to achieve the equivalent of “LEED” silver for new construction and major renovations, including the formal commissioning of each new project. The University Planning, Design and Construction Guidelines incorporate the University’s strategies, standards, and methodology to fulfill this commitment.

These included university specific systems that are required to maintain operation and functionality on the campus, as well as best practices from projects completed on the campus over the last twenty-plus years. The guidelines have recently been updated (December 2014) to include items related to sustainability such as reduced maintenance, material and equipment selections, and reducing both energy and water consumption. 

","The 2009 UNCG strategic plan, UNCG Tomorrow, mandates that all new major projects to meet LEED Silver standards at a minimum. All new buildings and major renovations must comply with standards established by NC Senate Bills 668 and 1946. These established a new Sustainable, Energy Efficient Buildings Program, with specific energy and water efficiency requirements for major new and renovated State-funded facilities that enter their schematic design phase on or after August 8, 2008. These requirements have been incorporated into State construction requirements (http://www.nc-sco.com/documents/guidelines/EEREPORT.pdf).

The State Sustainability Policy also includes a section on new construction: ""Design and Construction: Capital project planning and construction processes shall meet statutory energy and water efficiency requirements and deliver energy, water, and materials efficient buildings and grounds that minimize the impact on and/or enhance the site and provide good indoor environmental quality for occupants.""

UNCG’s Design and Construction Guidelines, General Design Standards, state: “Designers shall consider long-term durability and maintainability when selecting and specifying materials and equipment. Life cycle cost including installation, maintenance, and disposal will be considered in the selection of building systems and equipment.  The designer must develop life cycle cost studies and present the information for review by the University to assist with the selection of materials and equipment on major renovation and new construction projects.” These guidelines complement the state mandates (http://www.northcarolina.edu/apps/policy/index.php?pg=vs&id=5606). 

All designers are required to design new and renovated buildings in accordance with these guidelines. The professional design staff at UNCG reviews the design documents and monitors the construction to ensure all guidelines and policies are followed. Either the design consultant or a member of the FDC staff submits the templates to USGBC for certification on those projects seeking LEED certification. UNCG has 5 LEED APs  and 1 LEED Green Associate on staff.

Effective June 2007
-	All state funded major projects, which includes the following:
o	New Construction of 10,000 SF or greater 
o	Renovation (project involves >50% of the replacement value of the facility or a change in occupancy)
o	Commercial interior tenant fit-out project >7500 SF of leasable area
o	All must have conditioned space

-	All projects requiring certification must meet LEED Silver or Green Globes 2 Globes at a minimum
-	All required projects must be analyzed using a life cycle cost analysis comparing the cost and benefits of designing, constructing, maintaining, and operating the facility at the required certification level or better that causes the project to be designed and constructed in a manner that achieves the lowest 30 year life cycle cost
-	Energy Requirements:
o	Using LEED the project must obtain at least 40% of the available points for energy performance under EA Credit 1: Optimize Energy Performance.
o	Using Green Globes the project must obtain at least 20% of the available points for energy performance under C.1.1 Energy Consumption.
o	The State Engineer’s Office may waive the requirements of this item for a proposed major facility should it determine the costs of meeting this item are not economically feasible
-	All major projects that are certified under this Act must be inspected by a third party commissioning agent in the fifth, tenth and fifteenth year following certification.  Results will be submitted to OSE.  OSE may take appropriate measure to bring the building into compliance of the certifications if needed.
