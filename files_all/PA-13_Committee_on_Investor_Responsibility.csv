For the May 2014 board meeting, ACSRI presented an interim report and recommended that the board consider three options for new, meaningful actions, including:

Partial Divestment—from AU’s endowment (focused on the Carbon 200 fossil fuel companies). 
Investment—in alternative energy funds. 
Engagement—with energy companies through shareholder actions.

CLARKSON UNIVERSITY
STATEMENT OF INVESTMENT BELIEFS
February 21, 2013
The Clarkson University Values Statement includes a description of “Vision”:  Having a vision of a sustainable future helps us prepare for it.  Embracing the inevitable changes in our world as opportunities allows us to anticipate, promote, and facilitate change.
Our investment strategy will seek to embody this value by taking account of the relationship between 1) good environmental management, 2) sensitivity to social issues, and 3) and strong corporate governance; and long-term sustainable business profitability.  We will seek to overlay this strategy across our investment portfolio.  Our main influence will be through our strategic asset allocation, manager structure, manager selection, performance benchmarks, monitoring, and reporting – and not by getting involved in the day-to-day investment decisions, which is the role of our asset managers. 
We will favor investing on a positive “best in class” selection basis, and encourage the use of engagement rather than negative screening.
We believe companies with strong environmental, social, and governance profiles are better managed for the long term, have lower risk profiles, and are positioned to outperform their peers.  We engage indirectly through allocating capital to investment managers who invest with companies and sectors with positive economic, ecological, and social impact.
We will consider environmental impact, social justice, and corporate governance issues as we cast our proxy votes.

•	Understand what constitutes sustainable investments
•	Refine the College’s definition of sustainable investments through analyzing businesses’ environmental and social impact 
•	Understand basic investment strategies, including the impact of risk
•	Compare the performance of sustainable versus traditional investments 
•	Support businesses that demonstrate social and environmental stewardship 
•	Gain knowledge by utilizing firsthand experience to research, analyze, choose, monitor and report the fund’s investments

At this time, the investments are limited to stocks and bonds traded on the major exchanges, as well as mutual funds targeting sustainable industries.

The committee meets in accordance with interest of the group members, to analyze past investment performance, discuss changes to investment theory and practice, and to learn more about sustainable investing. This committee determines what the most appropriate investments are for the fund.

The objective of the investments, like an endowment, is long term growth, but the level of risk will be determined by the committee. As the fund grows, both through investment returns and further gifts, draws may be taken consistent with the college endowment expenditure policy in order to support sustainable improvements on campus. It is anticipated that no such draws would be taken before the fund grows to a balance of $100,000.
","Committee membership is open to college students, faculty, and staff. The committee works closely with the trustee finance and investment committees. Current membership includes students, Andy Griffiths (COA's administrative dean/CFO), and Jay Friedlander (faculty member, Sharpe-McNally Chair of Green and Socially Responsible Business). The committee is chaired by one of its student members. ","The committee was first convened in January 2015. With the receipt of a $15,000 donation to launch the sustainable investment fund, the committee researched and developed sustainability criteria to invest the funds. The committee collectively decided on investments with advice from a local bank. In the past year, the committee has developed more structured negative and positive screens for the investment fund. As a result, the committee has reinvested in funds that align more accordingly with the investment fund standards.

Current investment criteria:

The committee seeks out companies and funds that are leaders in their field according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, with priority given to sustainable industries and companies with transformative potential to green their industry. Assets are restricted from being invested in weapons, tobacco, and companies whose primary business involves the extraction, refining, or combustion of fossil fuels. The committee is additionally interested in investing in companies advancing the transition away from fossil fuels through renewable energies and sustainable transportation. The fund searches for investments that meet as many positive screen criteria as possible, by exemplifying best-in-class practices.

Outline of positive screens:
Environmental:
    Advancing and/or practicing energy efficiency
    Low greenhouse gas emissions
    Minimized air pollution
    Limited contamination of waterways and oceans
    Sustainable land-use and reduction of ecological encroachment
    Effective material conservation and sustainable waste practices

Social:
    Treatment of employees and relationship with labor
    Observance of the right to organize and health and safety standards
    Community relations, specifically communities impacted by company activities
    Observance of human rights and fair labor standards, including child labor restrictions

Governance:
    Transparent reporting
    Fair executive compensation, with regards to median worker pay
    Strong shareholder rights
    Disclosure of lobbying activities, including through third party organizations
    Displayed intention and credible plan for advancing sustainable goals 

Sustainable industries:
    The committee defines sustainable industries as those primarily concerned with advancing ESG factors in the wider marketplace and world, subject to the negative screen restrictions imposed on the investment fund.",http://www.coa.edu/sustinvestment.htm,--

Proxy Voting Guidelines from Socially Responsible Investing policy:
""Due to the nature of certain investment vehicles (mutual fund type investments), most funds do not afford the Foundation the ability to submit a proxy vote. However, occasionally the ability to vote arises. The management and staff of the Foundation, where possible, have been given the charge to vote proxy votes in a manner in which the environment and other socially responsible initiatives are supported.""

At least annually the Foundation encourages each manager to consider investments in sustainable industries and renewable energy initiatives via a personalized message from the President/CEO and endorsed by the Board of Directors.

In addition, the Summit Student Investment Fund directly engages students and their faculty/staff advisors in socially and environmentally responsible investing through the management of an actual investment fund within the Foundation valued at more than $300,000. Approximately twenty-five students per semester are given the charge to run the Summit Fund following the Socially Responsible Investing Principles as follows:

""Colorado State University, the College of Business and the Summit Student Managed Investment Fund values firms that are good stewards of society’s human and natural resources.  The Fund therefore seeks to direct investments away from firms whose operations are inconsistent with this principle.  

This socially responsible investing principle will be implemented by conducting an analysis of the social and environmental consequences of a candidate firm’s activities, relative to competitors in the same and similar lines of business. It is expected that databases will be acquired to facilitate this comparison, and that this analysis will become a standard part of the discussion and analysis prior to investing in any firm.

Suggested criteria include:
The Fund shall generally not invest in companies
1. Producing or supplying, as its core business, distilled alcoholic (hard liquor) beverages.
2. Manufacturing or distributing, as its core business, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco or smokeless tobacco
3. Owning or managing, as its core business, casinos, racetracks, or off-track betting parlors or any goods or services related to the gaming or lottery industries

This engagement includes campus forums convened in April 2015, January 2016 and February 2016, and a meeting in September 2015 of our students and students from Middlebury and Smith Colleges with Investure, a financial management firm that functions as the Investment Office for all three schools and several other institutions.

In spring and fall 2015 DSIG researched ESG practices of peer institutions; investor networks such as the Investor Network on Climate Risk, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Intentional Endowments Network; and investment beliefs statements. This research has resulted in a number of recommendations to the Committee on Investment that are under consideration. Responding to DSIG inquiries, Investure developed and adopted its own Investment Beliefs Statement that includes reference to ESG and ethical considerations as factors in their assessment of investment opportunities. 

Dickinson has joined with Middlebury and Smith Colleges to form the Sustainability Advisory Group and work together in promoting shared ESG considerations with Investure.

DSIG was preceded by the Sustainability Investment Task Force (SITF), a temporary task force that was created by the Board of Trustees in 2013 to examine and discuss fossil energy divestment and other questions concerning Dickinson’s endowment. The SITF met monthly from May 2013 through January 2014, and hosted a campus forum in November 2013. The SITF presented recommendations to the Board of Trustees in January 2014. The SITF recommended that Dickinson not divest from fossil energy at that point in time, but also recommended that the College (i) communicate to Investure that fossil fuel investments are in tension with Dickinson’s sustainability values, (ii) increase investments in Investure’s sustainable investment fund, (iii) create a forum for structured dialogue by the Dickinson community of ESG investment concerns, and (iv) create a revolving fund to help finance sustainability investments in the campus. Positive action was taken on all these recommendations, including creation of the Dickinson Sustainable Investment Group as a forum for dialogue about ESG investment. 

The SIG and SITF build on earlier work of Dickinson’s Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Discussion Group, which was active from 2007 through 2009. The SRI Discussion Group led to Dickinson adopting triple-bottom-line principles for investment management and to Investure creating a sustainable investment fund for members of the consortium.",http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/600/investing_in_sustainability,"Information about the activities Sustainable Investment Task Force in 2014 can be found here: http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/527/sustainable_investments_task_force.

Recognizing the need for a mechanism to assist the President on making recommendations to the BOT on this issue, two committees were created, the President’s Special Committee on Investment Responsibility (PSC) and the Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility (ACIR). 

The PSC considers proposals from the University community relating to investment responsibility concerns and determines if there are credible allegations of substantial social injury. If the PSC agrees an issue requires further investigation, it will be referred to the ACIR for further review. The ACIR examines the issue and determines whether to propose to the President a course of action by the BOT. The President has the option to take the recommendation to the BOT or provide a written explanation to the ACIR on why their recommendation was not accepted. The President’s Office presents an annual report to the Duke Community on the work of the PSC, ACIR and the President’s and BOT responses. 

When the University community has engaged in substantive discourse on an issue and expressed broad concern that a substantive social injury is being caused by such policies or practices, the President may make a recommendation to the BOT. Where the BOT agrees, it may instruct the Duke University Mgt. Company (DUMAC) to take appropriate action, including the exercise of the University’s practicable shareholder rights to seek modification of the company’s activities to eliminate or reduce the injury, using such means as – 
- Direct correspondence with management
- Proxy votes
- Sponsoring shareholder resolutions

In cases where these actions do not impact the company’s actions, the BOT can also instruct DUMAC to divest the securities in question within a reasonable time period. 
","The PSC is composed of the Provost and the Executive Vice President (or their delegates); the Dean of the one of the professional schools; the chair of ECAC or faculty member designated by ECAC; and a young trustee designated by the BOT. The PSC chair is appointed by the President.

The ACIR has fourteen voting members: one trustee, two undergraduate and two graduate or professional students nominated respectively by the Duke Student Government and Graduate and Professional Student Council, one alumnus nominated by the Duke University Alumni Association, four faculty members nominated by the Academic Council, the University Counsel or his or her delegate, the Deputy Treasurer or his or her delegate, and two administrative appointees chosen by the President. Each representative body will be asked to nominate two individuals for each position and the President will select who will be invited to serve; the Board of Trustees will elect the trustee member of the committee.
Members shall be appointed for at least two years and may be reappointed, serving until their successors take office. The ACIR Chair shall be appointed by the President from among the voting members. 
","The Duke University Advisory Council on Investment Responsibility (ACIR) has worked to better understand how Duke can to incorporate best practices for investment. ACIR reviews requests from groups on campus such as Duke Open for investment transparency and DivestDuke for fossil fuel divestment. The following links are to reports from ACIR to the president of Duke University:

The Board approved this investment and added an additional 5% the following year. As of June 30, 2015, the socially responsible investment fund (Portfolio 21) occupies 17..4% of the total endowment.
The SRIAC committee charge is as follows:
Review the College’s investment portfolio and provide recommendations regarding socially responsible investment initiatives to the Investment Committee of the Board of Trustees.
The SRIAC is chaired by the chief financial officer of the College and consists of up to two well-qualified students appointed by student senate and one faculty member appointed by the FCEB and approved by the provost.

The committee meets to perform tasks such as reviewing quarterly returns from the investment portfolio and changes in the portfolio. On the basis of these reviews, they make recommendations to the Investment Committee of the Board of Trustees for action. These recommendations may relate to proxy voting, increased transparency of the portfolio, divestment of certain securities, or positive and negative screening of investments.

The SRIAC's objective is to assist the College in making investment decisions that reflect its environmental mission. In the case that SRI returns are not equal to or exceed non-SRI returns, alternative SRI funds are suggested.

The SRIAC's deliberations are guided in part by best practices in socially responsible investing, as identified by the Sustainable Endowments Institute and AASHE’s sustainability tracking and rating system’s investment section. The recommendations are made public knowledge through the College newspaper, presentations, or a branch of the College website.

Nicole Harman, Student ","The committee recommended the Socially Responsible Investment Fund Porfolio 21 be increased to 15% of the endowment in FY 2011. As of June 30, 3015, the fund is at 17.4%. 

In 2013 the committee recommended that the College divest from fossil fuel holdings  based on the criteria suggested by 350.org, which is to divest from the top 200 publicly-traded companies which hold most of the world’s known coal, oil, and gas reserves. The list of these companies is maintained by Fossil Free Indexes, LLC.  In May 2013, the Green Mountain College Board of Trustees committed to divestment and the divestment process was completed by the College in 2015. 

The proposal to divest in fossil fuels resulted from a collaboration between student groups, including Divest GMC, the College administration, and the sustainability office. Students in Divest GMC hosted a “teach-in” which included an interview with author and environmentalist Bill McKibben, a long-time friend of the College. In response to the board’s decision, McKibben said “I’m delighted Green Mountain College has taken a leadership role in this important issue. GMC has long had a great reputation for environmental studies. Now they’ve demonstrated that it’s a core part of their value. What leadership!”

In October 2015, Green Mountain College hosted the Vermont Campus Sustainability Network annual meeting focussing on responsible investing. Members of the committee coordinated the content with a focus on responsible investing, general, positive and negative screening, fossil fuel divestment, Environmental Social Governance Policies. 

The committee is currently reviewing our our holdings for positive shielding screens in place and working to create a recommendation for an  Environmental Social Governance Policy to apply to all of Green Mountain College’s holdings. 

In addition to the SRIAC's actions, the campus sustainability council continues to actively manage the green revolving loan fund. In the last three years, the council has implemented three investment projects: 1) A replacement of all 80 outdoor lamp posts with LEDs, construction of a 5.8 kW solar charging station, and a renovation of the Two Editor's Inn (A College-owned residence used to house guests) to be a model for residential energy efficiency for older buildings.

Hampshire practices affirmative investing in support of institutional values, including seeking to support clean energy and innovation in relation to environmental protection.

The policy states: “Business practices that include safe and supportive work environments, products that build economic strength, and activities that benefit the disadvantaged, including charitable giving, enhance the financial security and long-term sustainability of companies in which the College invests.” Whereas: “Poor business practices related to human rights, the workplace and the environment pose reputational, financial, operational and legal risks to the College’s investments and therefore the future financial security of the College.”

Under the policy, Hampshire favors investments in businesses that emphasize providing beneficial goods and services, pursuing research and development programs that hold promise for new products of social benefit and for increased employment prospects, maintaining fair labor practices, maintaining a safe and healthy work environment, demonstrating innovation in relation to environmental protection, using their power to enhance the quality of life for the underserved segments of our society and encourage local community reinvestment, and having a record of sustained support for higher education.","Investment Committee

Each year, through a series of meetings, the ACSR carefully considers a range of shareholder resolutions raising issues of corporate social responsibility, in regard to publicly traded companies in which Harvard owns shares.  It formulates its recommendations in light of what is now a wide and deep body of precedent, in areas that range from human rights to environmental practices, from equal employment opportunity to corporate political contributions and beyond. The ACSR presents its recommendations, along with its reasoning, to the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (CCSR). In light of the ACSR’s analysis of issues and consideration of precedent, the CCSR exercises the Harvard Corporation’s fiduciary duty to determine how Harvard votes on social responsibility proxies each year.  The CCSR issues an extensive annual report that summarizes the ACSR’s recommendations and rationale and sets forth the CCSR’s decisions on how to vote.   While advice on proxy voting has been the steady focus of the ACSR’s annual efforts, over the years the CCSR has occasionally sought advice from the ACSR on questions of investment (or divestment) policy.  ","List of members at: http://www.harvard.edu/shareholder-responsibility-committees
","The CCSR publishes an annual report summarizing its actions at: http://www.harvard.edu/shareholder-responsibility-committees. 

Over the years, Harvard’s two Shareholder Committees have considered shareholder proposals addressing a wide range of topics, including environmental concerns, corporate involvement in the political process, human rights and equal employment.  For example, in 2015, the CCSR followed the ACSR's recommendations to support proposals calling for companies to: report on political spending, including indirect political contributions;  adopt goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane; report of how herbicide usage with seed products is monitored; report on practices to minimize the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water resources and communities; and report on environmental and social risks related to the palm oil supply chain.

In 2014, the CCSR followed the ACSR's recommendation to support proposals calling on companies to adopt goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to provide detailed reports on corporate political giving, to review policies for addressing human rights, and to provide diversity data on workplace demographics.",http://www.harvard.edu/shareholder-responsibility-committees,--

","The SRI has helped to lead recent divestment efforts and is working with the college President and administration to address this issues. In January 2013 a panel addressed divestment from fossil fuels and the discussion continued throughout the Spring in a series of forums. 

RISE, a new initiative from January 2014, demonstrates the positive effects of socially responsible investing and educates students about the sustainable investment process. Students are investing $150,000 into sustainable companies using environmental, social, and governance criteria. RISE is also aided by the use of the MSCI ESG data set which was purchased in January to aid our research. 

The group surveyed the student body about their opinions of using ESG criteria in the endowment. The results may be used in a presentation to Board members. 

The Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing has been working on the review of the Sustainable Investments Initiative (SII) using the MSCI dataset. The review has been waiting on transparency from the administration on the contents of the SII before it can be submitted or presented. 

SRI has been pushing the administration to continue to work on the President's commitment from the end of August 2013 to implement a stronger set of ESG principles in the endowment.

The Endowment Committee recognizes that this responsibility is best performed by directing professional investment manager(s) and advisor(s), rather than acting as investment manager(s) themselves. The Endowment Committee is comprised of members of the Board of Trustees. The Endowment’s assets will be managed by one or more investment manager(s) and/or advisor(s) as selected by the Endowment Committee. These investment professionals will be responsible for investing the assigned assets in accordance with Naropa's investment policy.

SOCIAL SCREENING CRITERIA
It is Naropa University’s policy to invest its Endowment assets in a way that is consistent with the Buddhist precept “not causing harm”. As an investor, Naropa University believes that it has the responsibility to influence corporate policy through: 

1) selecting investments that do not knowingly conflict with this mission,
2) constructive dialogue with corporate management as a shareholder, and 
3) proxy voting on shareholder resolutions.

In keeping with this overall philosophy, the Naropa University Endowment will on a best efforts basis avoid investment in the following:
1. Primary manufacturers of weapons systems (both conventional and nuclear), firearms, or ammunition
2. Companies with egregious records of environmental damage – through toxic emissions, mismanagement of hazardous waste, irresponsible use of natural resources, and/or regulatory violations and fines – particularly compared with other companies in similar industries
3. Manufacturers of tobacco, alcohol, or gambling products
4. Owners or designers of nuclear power facilities
5. Companies with pervasive and/or longstanding patterns of discriminatory behavior
6. Companies with weak employee relations records, major safety controversies, and/or inadequate benefits
7. Companies where their primary business is involved in natural resource extraction unless the company has a superior environmental record compared to companies in the same industry and has been exemplary of “best sustainable practices in their industry”.

In addition, Naropa University strongly encourages investment in corporations that are providing solutions to social and environmental problems, specifically companies that:
1. Promote consistently fair employment practices and promote diversity through innovative employee benefits and programs, equitable pay structures, safe working conditions, and training and advancement programs for women and minorities
2. Show industry leadership in promoting environmental well-being through waste reduction and recycling programs, source reduction of toxic emissions, use of alternative energy sources, sustainable use of natural resources, environmentally-friendly products and services
3. Manufacture products and/or services that have a direct positive environmental impact
4. Work to eradicate child labor and sweatshop conditions within all factories (both company-owned and those owned by suppliers) where goods are produced
5. Participate as concerned, involved citizens in their communities
6. Uphold global human rights and international justice in their operations around the world.","Trustees

The key criteria used in making this determination include the presence of “considerable, thoughtful, and sustained campus interest,” determination that a core University value is at stake, and the ability of the University community to reach consensus on a response.","The 2013-2014 Committee members were as follows:

Additionally, the Resources Committee hosted a lecture for the public on socially responsible investing and how various educational institutions approach it.",http://www.princeton.edu/vpsec/cpuc/committees/rc,"Princeton University’s primary mechanism for consideration of investment-driven social responsibility issues is the Resources Committee of the Council of the Princeton University Community. The Resources Committee was created in 1970 and includes members of the faculty, undergraduate students, graduate students, and staff. The key criteria for consideration of issues, including matters of environmental or social concern, are the presence of “considerable, thoughtful, and sustained campus interest,” determination that a core University value is at stake, and the ability of the University community to reach consensus on a response. The Resources Committee has a broad mandate to help identify issues of concern to the University community, provide opportunities for discussion and education, research and review alternatives, and recommend a course of action that shares broad support across campus constituencies. When appropriate, the Resources Committee makes investment recommendations to the Trustees regarding issues of broad social concern.

At a time when the University’s portfolio included substantial investment in traditional stocks and was managed directly by the Trustee Committee on Finance, the Resources Committee made proxy voting recommendations to the Trustees. However, as investment instruments changed and the Princeton University Investment Company (PRINCO) assumed day-to-day management of the Endowment, the number of opportunities to vote proxies decreased significantly. PRINCO, an internal unit of the University responsible for investing the Endowment, allocates all but a very small fraction of the portfolio to commingled funds and partnerships in which proxy votes cannot be controlled directly. As a result, the Resources Committee stopped evaluating proxy ballots and instead devoted its energies to creating a venue to discuss investment-related issues of significant interest more broadly. This venue allows the Committee to contemplate and implement change on a larger and more systemic basis than the very narrow, indeed negligible, basis provided by proxy voting. Princeton believes this approach is more likely to create opportunities for individual and institutional change and is more effective and efficient than a narrow focus on proxy voting and investment restrictions."

The Endowment investment policy diversifies investments and provides a balance to enhance total return while avoiding undue risk in any single asset class or investment category. The UC Regents manage 18.5% of the UC Davis Endowment Fund's assets and external investment managers manage the other 81.5%. 

Additionally, The UC Regents have prohibited the purchase of securities issued by tobacco companies. The purchase of securities issued by tobacco companies is prohibited in separately managed accounts as well. The Regents have defined a tobacco company as “a company which derives its revenues from the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products or, if a diversified company, that no other business line contributes more revenues or earnings than tobacco products."" The Treasurer will determine what constitutes a tobacco company based on standard industry classification of the major index providers (e.g., Russell, MSCI) and communicate this list to investment managers annually and whenever changes occur. The Committee recognizes that the establishment of social investing restrictions limits investment opportunities and should be accompanied by adjusting performance evaluation standards appropriately.

The UC Davis Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation in response to the University's recognition that private support is essential to maintaining and enhancing the margin of excellence at UC Davis. The Foundation helps UC Davis obtain private gifts (in support of research, teaching, and public service) and manages the gift assets. Distinguished community members, University administrators, and faculty and alumni representatives make up the 48-member Board of Trustees that governs the Foundation. The Board meets quarterly in regular session, and the Foundation's standing committees meet throughout the year to review Foundation business and to recommend action. The Foundation's standing committees include Audit, Development, Executive, Investment/Finance, and Nominating.

The Foundation accepts, administers, and invests private gifts in the form of cash and real or personal property and manages the funds either as endowments or as funds available for current expenditure. The Foundation’s net assets at June 30, 2013 were $288.3 million, of which the endowment comprised approximately $240.4 million. (These amounts are stated without regard to GASB 33 accounting rules for comparative purposes for the past ten years.)

From the Foundation's inception, members of the Board of Trustees have formed a crucial link between UC Davis and the community. The Trustees communicate about UC Davis to the public, and in so doing, build interest in the campus and support for its programs. The excellence that UC Davis has achieved has been assisted by the community, and the Trustees and volunteers who serve the UC Davis Foundation continue to play a critical role in the growth and success of the campus.

Major initiatives at UC Davis funded through gifts to the Foundation include the Center for Mind and Brain, the Mind Institute, Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts, Energy Efficiency Center, Child Family Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Campus Arboretum, CAES: Agricultural Sustainability Institute, Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science (RMI), 21 endowed professorships, 223 student scholarships and fellowships, 61 department chairs, research support, departmental support, and support for unrestricted gifts. Buildings constructed with partial or full funding from gifts to the Foundation include the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science (RMI) which is LEED Platinum certified, the Mondavi Center for the Performings Arts, and substantial commitments for the Jan Shrem and Maria. Manetti Farrow Museum of Art to be completed in 2015.  The continuing growth in these areas is a reflection of the University's commitment to the development of private support to sustain its quest for excellence."

1.	Examine our relationships with other universities, national and international organizations, and others, to determine how we can work together to best meet our common objectives. This would include our relationship with the University’s contracted licensing agency (The Collegiate Licensing Company – CLC) regarding corporate social responsibility in the production of officially licensed products utilizing the indicia (work marks and logos) of the University.
2.	Regularly monitor the on-going corporate social responsibility efforts of the Workers Rights Consortium and the Fair Labor Association and recommend University action in response, as appropriate.
3.	Encourage and support academic research in this area to advance the understanding of global labor issues throughout the University community.
4.	Encourage and support community awareness of corporate social responsibility and action through a variety of means, including curricular development, facilitation of dialogue among university related groups, and ongoing communication.
5.	Respond to emerging issues related to CSR within the University community and advise the President’s Office with respect to such issues and potential responses.

","Through the efforts and approval of the President’s Committee on Corporate Social Responsibility (PCCSR), the University of Connecticut adopted a Vendor Code of Conduct to support interests in working with vendors that demonstrate a commitment to values that include, but are not limited to, nondiscrimination, respect for human rights and labor standards, health and safety, environmental compliance, and environmental sustainability. UConn is committed to building a safe, healthy, and sustainable environmental through natural resource conservation, the purchase and use of environmentally responsible products, materials, and services, and preventing pollution and minimizing waste through reduction, reuse, and recycling. The University seeks to partner with vendors that demonstrate commitment to these values.
This past semester, the PCSSR held the forum, How to Promote Human Rights and Sustainability in Collegiate Licensing, Procurement, and Investment, to discuss the challenges and opportunities for colleges and universities to responsibly manage the human rights and environmental impacts of their business operations. Experts, professionals, students, and other stakeholders were present to determine ways to ensure that university and business operations yield positive social and environmental impacts through licensing, procurement, and investment relationships. 
The University of Connecticut’s Think Outside the Bottle initiative distributes reusable water bottles to first year students and members of UCPEA, AAUP, and AFSCME with the goal of reducing our carbon footprint on campus, and educating the community about the many benefits of drinking tap versus bottled water. The installation of water bottle refill stations around campus also continues to add to this effort to create a more sustainable campus, cutting back on waste created and energy used to produce disposable plastic water bottles.
",http://csr.uconn.edu/,"At the University of Connecticut, the President’s Committee on Corporate Social Responsibility exists to provide assistance and guidance to the President’s Office to assure that the University maintains its position as a leader among institutions of higher education committed to the protection and advancement of CSR policies that reflect respect for fundamental human rights and the dignity of all people. The PCCSR Committee acts to make sure there are socially and environmentally responsible investment opportunities in terms of the University’s purchasing policies.

Think Outside the Bottle is a new UConn initiative that distributes reusable water bottles to incoming first year students and staff with the intent of decreasing bottled water consumption on campus. By doing this and continuing to install water bottle refill stations around campus, the university hopes to create a more sustainable campus and decrease its reliance on bottled water.

Finally, the PCCSR was able to help the student managed funds (which invest in individual stocks rather than indexes and mutual funds) design guidelines for Socially and Environmentally Responsible Investing, which were implemented in Fall 2013.

The Board of Trustees develops basic University policy on investments and delegates the execution of those policies to its administrative agents, who are required to be guided by the Board's policies and report to the Board. The Comptroller has been delegated transaction authority to assist the Audit, Budget, Finance, and Facilities Committee of the Board in the areas of investments and banking. That Committee meets regularly to review the University's investment program. The investment policy describes the overall level of risk the Board of Trustees deems appropriate.

The Vice President/Chief Financial Officer and Comptroller is authorized to manage University investments at his/her discretion consistent with the Board of Trustees' policy and/or with investment managers appointed by the Board of Trustees.

The investment function is centralized in Treasury Operations. The Vice President/Chief Financial Officer and Comptroller has delegated to the Senior Assistant Vice President for Treasury Operations the authority and responsibility to develop, and, after necessary consultations, disseminate guidelines and procedures regarding the investment of University funds. The Senior Assistant Vice President for Treasury Operations is also authorized to develop, install, and oversee the operations of suitable business systems to accomplish this function. The Senior Assistant Vice President for Business and Finance or delegate is responsible for the security and administration of University bank accounts. The Senior Director of Treasury Operations is responsible for the daily management of University bank balances and general oversight of EFT activity. Requests for exceptions to approved investment policies should be addressed to the Comptroller.

The Senior Assistant Vice President for Treasury Operations is also responsible and has authority for day-to-day investment operations. Endowment investment transactions are reported to the Board of Trustees. Investment managers are appointed by the Board of Trustees to execute the policy and invest the assets in accordance with established policy, but apply their own judgments concerning relative investment values. Investment managers are accorded full discretion, within policy limits, to select individual investments and diversify their portfolios.

They do not have a CIR.  A small portion of our investment funds are invested with the UW Trust Funds.

The Trust Funds Office is responsible for the administrative and investment oversight of endowment and other investable funds entrusted to the Board of Regents of the UW System.  These funds currently consist primarily of monies that have been gifted directly to a UW institution, rather than to one of the separate, supporting foundations.  The Office reports to and supports the Business, Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Regents, which serves as the ultimate fiduciary and trustee of these investable funds.

Core investment oversight efforts include the following: 1) determination of investment policies and guidelines, 2) determination of appropriate investment strategies, asset allocations, and spending policies, 3) implementation of investment strategies, primarily through the selection of external managers, 4) on-going evaluation of overall investment performance and manager performance.  Although investment objectives focus primarily on financial return relative to risks assumed, considerations of ""social responsibility"" are not ignored.  Social issues brought to the attention of the Office and/or the Board of Regents are typically researched by staff and reported on to the Business and Finance Committee.  Also, shareholder proxies are voted in a socially-conscious manner, consistent with Regent policies.

Regarding administration, the Trust Funds Office works externally with donors and other related parties, and internally with the benefiting campuses and colleges, to facilitate the receipt and proper use (compliant with donor terms and conditions) of all gifts and bequests.  Operationally, the Office is responsible for the deposit of funds, fund- and account-level transaction processing, maintenance of the donor account-level recordkeeping system and its reconciliation and integration with other accounting systems.
