The function of the ECOllaborative is to enhance and showcase American University's groundbreaking environmental and sustainability research, degree-granting programs, and campus infrastructure. Our efforts pull together the diverse perspectives and talents of more than fifty American University faculty and numerous staff and students. Our interests and our particular lines of inquiry are as varied as our backgrounds. We are united by considerations of justice, equity, and inclusion, as we work to develop new knowledge and insights to mitigate or reverse the effects of environmental degradation in the United States and around the world, and as we contribute to building more resilient relationships between human endeavors and the planet on which all life depends.

The ECOllaborative Colloquium series brings together faculty conducting research in a specific field of sustainability to share findings, elevate each other's research, and bring greater awareness of sustainability to the campus community. Unlike other lecture series, this colloquium is specifically designed to have faculty share peer to peer while enlightening the community and driving forward not just campus sustainability but the greater movement. Series themes have included water, conservation, energy, climate. and environmental law and are widely attended by faculty, staff, and all levels of students.","As a result of the ECOllaborative group and colloquium series, there has been increased camaraderie and communication across academic schools and issue areas.

This was provided to the Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability to develop and deploy promising solutions to sustainability challenges. This investment was designed entirely to support programs, which led to the creation of the Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives. The investment will be distributed over a period of five years and by 2017 Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives will be self-sustaining.

The Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives is broken down into eight distinctive initiatives that can be grouped together in three focus areas. The three focus areas are delivering sustainability solutions, accelerating global impact, and inspiring future leaders. Accelerating global impact is made up of two programs, one of which is the Global Sustainability Studies Program. This program focuses on providing students with opportunities to study and help solve sustainability problems in a global context. To do this, Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives helped create four study abroad opportunities focusing on a variety of sustainability issues. The Global Sustainability Studies Program also provides financial support for the four sustainability study abroad programs to Sustainability majors and minors. ",Summer 2013 was the first summer that the Sustainability Solutions Scholarship was offered to 80 students.

Bowdoin College,2016-02-25,2016-02-25 17:01:11,cpayson@bowdoin.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Local food innovation,"Bowdoin College was a proud partner of the Maine Innovation Challenge, an initiative aimed at encouraging the sharing of ideas on how to significantly enhance current local food models, such as farmers’ markets, fish markets, CSAs, pick-your-own and farm-stands, or create new models that adapt to local and regional needs, utilize technology and adopt creative business structures such as cooperatives and L3Cs.

The event was kicked off at Bowdoin College with a keynote address by Michael Rozyne ’78 titled “Sustainable Food – Healthy, Green, Fair, Affordable: Can We Have It All and Scale It Up?”  Rozyne spoke about the current local and sustainable food movement in the U.S., and the issues, challenges and obstacles that must be overcome to scale up this movement. He also touched on how innovation, technology, and collaboration might come into play.  Mr. Rozyne is executive director of Red Tomato, a nonprofit that connects farmers to consumers, relying on wholesale distribution to deliver farm products to local grocery stores. Previously, Rozyne co-founded Equal Exchange, a cooperative business that trades food in a way that he says empowers both farmers and consumers.

The keynote address was followed by a three day event at Bowdoin College where thirty-six participants, representing 10 teams, participated in the Maine Innovation Challenge.   Over the course of the weekend several resource people were available to advise teams and two short workshops were provided on the Business Model Canvas and Creating a Pitch.  Culminating the weekend were presentations by each team, delivering their proposals to a team of five judges.  

The organizers of The Challenge wanted teams to demonstrate bold and big ideas pushed by people who want to challenge each other and the status quo. They encouraged solutions that either significantly enhance current local food models or create new models that adapt to local and regional needs, utilize technology and adopt creative business structures such as cooperatives and L3Cs.  They asked participants to think about processes along the entire distribution chain including aggregating, processing, distributing or marketing.
Maine Farm & Sea Cooperative and Forq Food Lab were the winners of the Challenge.  Both teams received $5,000 plus 6 hours of legal services. The New Beet Market and Frinklepod Farm tied for second place and each received $1,750 plus 8 hours of consulting services. Two student teams, AgriGatr, from Hampshire College and the Darling Sea Farm, from the Darling Center, received Honorable Mention.
Bowdoin’s Environmental Studies Program was honored to be a partner and host of the event, and see events like this as an opportunity to help initiate a more sustainable future.  Bowdoin’s faculty, staff and students participating on the advisory committee are already looking forward to hosting the event again next year.

The policy indicates that any construction equipment, not already possessing Tier 4 emissions equipment, must have an added diesel particulate filter to be on the job site. Exceptions are made for equipment that is not available as Tier 4 or particulate filters are not available (i.e. certain heavy equipment such as cranes). ","Since adopting this policy, Chatham has implemented a daily on-site inspection program, which was adhered to by all of our contractors. The Office of Sustainability, in partnership with GASP, conducted a Clean Construction Workshop & Seminar in Fall 2014 for local businesses and institutions. We partnered with the only other institution in the region to commit to a clean construction policy, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), to provide this educational program to explain what the policy entails and dispel myths about requirements. Starting in September 2015, Chatham's Director of Sustainability, Dr. Mary Whitney, will be speaking at the University of Pittsburgh about our experiences and provide mentorship as they seek to implement a similar policy.

Existing forests have not been given serious consideration in addressing carbon neutrality goals on college and university campuses. At Colgate University, we recognize that carbon storage and annual sequestration is among the many assets provided by Colgate's forested lands. In 2013, we determined that our 1,059 acres of forests contain 165,491 tons of stored carbon while sequestering an additional 1,578 tons of carbon annually. We will remeasure our forested lands in order to determine rate of growth and carbon sequestration every 5 years.

In early 2014, we received certification from the American Tree Farm Program for long-term sustainable management. This explicit added value will make it more difficult to develop any of our existing forests for any future projects. This was innovative work that emphasizes the value of campus forests in climate solutions. Furthermore, Colgate now has the largest forest certified under the American Tree Farm Program in the Northeast.

This project continues to gain momentum and attention throughout the higher education community.

The 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) resulted in a new global treaty to address climate change.

In the course students learned about the negotiation process leading to the new treaty as well as the substantive content of the treaty. They learned about the major negotiating blocs and positions they bring to the negotiations and the roles played by non-State actors in contributing to the final outcome. They also practiced climate politics, as members of the youth constituency of the UNFCCC, as members of the student organization Earth in Brackets, and/or as members of the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice.

The bulk of the course was taught during the first four weeks of winter break, spending the first three weeks at the COP in Paris, France. During the final week of the course, students traveled to Uppsala University in Sweden where they collectively debriefed with Swedish peers on the results of the summit and critically evaluated what the results mean for global, national, and local politics of climate change post-2015. Weekly preparatory Skype lecture/discussions during the ten weeks of the fall term also contributed to the coursework.

Typical of other university Climate Action Plans, it lays out a large number of recommended operational actions and goals, the responsibility of which rests heavily on the operations staff of the campus and its facilities. However, an atypical distinction in Emory’s plan is not only the hefty inclusion of academic and research involvement in greenhouse gas emissions reductions at Emory, but the specific requirement that each of Emory University’s nine academic units convene a Dean-appointed Climate Action Plan committee to draft and implement its own unit-specific CAP. This innovative approach provides each unit with the opportunity to tailor the University’s goals to its own operations and academics, highlighting the uniqueness and autonomy of each school, and the corresponding unique and autonomous methods they can utilize to reduce GHG emissions from their own operations and behaviors. This approach also allows units to protect practices that are required for the output of quality research and findings expected of them, and to make up for the GHG emissions resulting from those protected practices in other ways. Some illustrations of how the creation of individual academic unit CAPs has greatly diversified Emory’s approach to GHG emissions reduction can be seen in the way that the Candler School of Theology weaves spirituality and Creation theory into its commitments; or the way the School of Medicine acknowledges its particularly heavy after-hours facility useage; and in the way that the School of Public Health maintains its need to encourage oversees travel for research and practical experience, and aims to make up for these emissions through aggressive energy conservation measures on campus.
Emory’s academic unit CAPs were written and finalized in 2013-2014, and begin their implementation with a sense of purpose and identity that sets them apart from the Emory-wide plan, yet integrates them into the fold just the same.

Think Sustainability. Think Justice. Make Eco-Equity.

The GW Office of Sustainability and the Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service are providing an opportunity to support GW students in their social entrepreneurial efforts to address environmental and social justice issues in Washington, D.C. The grant comes as part of the ongoing collaboration between The George Washington University and Siemens Industry, Inc., Building Technologies Division, and is part of their joint commitment to environmental and social sustainability.

Launched in January 2015, GW students are invited to propose a project in collaboration with a community partner that enhances the local community. The project must have both environmental AND social impact in an under-served or low-income local community, and be responsive to the assets and needs of the community. Environmental impact can include directly addressing a local environmental problem or improving local environmental quality. Social impact can involve increased inclusion and participation of local residents in taking action to improve their neighborhood, getting involved in decision-making, or other direct benefits.

A total of $15,000 is available for one or more winning student projects. Students are required to work with a GW faculty or staff mentor as a resource, and are not prohibited from receiving additional grants for their projects.

Projects must have a positive impact within an under-served or low-income neighborhood in or around Washington, D.C. Projects can build on past or ongoing work with a community partner, or a new relationship can be established with a community partner. Projects must also raise awareness within the GW community about environmental/climate justice. Projects targeting the GW campus may also be considered, and should endeavor to demonstrate a local impact beyond campus.

Project deliverables will include a written report and publicly available video or live presentation that outlines the project, your experience with it, and its outcomes. Deliverables also include the project itself and a plan to sustain the project beyond the life of the initial funding.","The GW team will have more information on measurable outcomes once the first full cycle of the Eco-Equity Challenge is complete, including launch and implementation of student-community projects.

The Sustainability Office worked with key faculty members to develop an RfP (Request for Proposals) that was then provided to several classes that make up the core curriculum so that students could gain experience working as environmental consultants. By connecting with core curriculum classes, a wider spectrum of students than just students pursuing environmentally focused degrees were involved in this process. 

The RfP called for students to research potential providers and ultimately select three finalists, which would then be voted on through a campus-wide input process, also designed by students. Various classes took up distinct parts of the request. For example, a forestry class researched six potential forest offset projects and vendors and ultimately suggested one, which became a finalist. A senior seminar in environmental studies researched numerous potential projects and recommended one finalist. Finally, a student in a delicate balance class and another student in an economics class recommended the same provider, who also became a finalist. These three finalists were vetted by the Campus Sustainability Council and then recommended to a first-year voices class that was charged with explaining what climate neutrality was to the whole campus, and getting the campus to rank the providers through a survey. "," 
The winner of the campus-wide vetting process was Native Energy’s Seneca Meadows Landfill Gas project which received over 40% of the campus vote. The project, located in Waterloo, NY, captures methane from a landfill and either flares the methane or uses it to turn turbines to create electricity. The project was thoroughly researched to ensure it meets ACUPCC criteria outlined in V.1.0 of the Voluntary Carbon Offset Protocol. A total of 3,837 MT CO2e were purchased to cover FY 2015 and 3,655 were purchased to cover FY 2014.
  
Respondents cited the local nature of the Seneca Meadows project and its straightforward way of mitigating emissions as the primary reasons for ranking it first. Through the lead of this student-led project-vetting, the college purchased enough offsets to cover all emissions reported in this inventory as well as the emissions estimated for FY 2014, in addition to a 10% buffer for each year.

This building will house the new admissions office of the College and will also provide instructional space, serve as a hub to share information about the campus, and showcase Hampshire’s mission. 

The College is pursuing Living Building Certification (LBC), which requires the creation of a net-zero energy, waste, and water building. Not only is this standard consistent with our institutional values, but it will also provide rich learning opportunities for students. As part of the LBC challenge, the building will be situated to eliminate traffic from the center of campus, shifting the focus from fossil fuel powered vehicles to people.  
There are currently fewer than ten LBC-certified buildings in the country, and Hampshire can provide national leadership at the confluence of architectural design and energy and water conservation.  Our design team, which includes Bruner Cott architects and Jonathan Wright (Hampshire alumnus) builders, are working closely with the International Living Future Institute to address all aspects of the Living Building Challenge (https://ilbi.org/lbc).

The International Living Future Institute hosted the Net Positive Energy + Water Conference at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, February 4-5, 2014.  Carl Weber (Assoc. Director of Facilities), Jason Tor (Dean of Natural Sciences) and Beth Hooker (Director of Food, Farm and Sustainability) attended conference.  The conference brought together leading experts from around the world to develop net zero energy and water concepts through the restorative framework of the Living Building Challenge™, the world's most rigorous green building standard. The conference program included a reception and opening plenary, several keynote speakers and education sessions organized into three tracks: Net Zero Energy Design, Net Zero Water Design and Frontiers of Net Zero Energy.   



In addition to our own building construction, Hampshire College is welcoming environmental learning center, The Hitchcock Center to campus.  The Hitchcock Center will lease Hampshire lands, and they are also working toward a LBC certification.  
http://hitchcockcenter.org/index.php/about-us/our-living-building-project/
","The Living Building Challenge is the built environment's most rigorous performance standard. It calls for the creation of building projects at all scales that operate as cleanly, beautifully and efficiently as nature's architecture. To be certified under the Challenge, projects must meet a series of ambitious performance requirements, including net zero energy, waste and water, over a minimum of 12 months of continuous occupancy.

The ABCDC initiative began as an idea roughly four years ago and was first implemented last summer. Overseen directly by the ABCDC, the program buys up homes in Allston and Brighton and resells them under an owner-occupancy deed restriction, which stipulates that the owner must live on the property.

Recognizing investors’ chokehold on the market, Harvard “committed to contribute” to the new homeownership program after discussions with local residents, according to Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke. The University donated $3 million to the initiative as part of its community benefits package, detailed in the master plan for its Allston developments.

“Harvard provided [the] grant money that became the foundation for the program,” said Sarah Kitterman, senior loan officer at Boston Community Capital, a nonprofit community development financial institution that backs the homeownership initiative.

Kitterman said Harvard’s $3 million constituted a “critical layer of equity capital” which the ABCDC could then leverage to raise more money. Armed with Harvard funding, the fledgling program approached BCC for a loan.

The initiative also seeks to catalyze AES work across the liberal arts community through curriculum workshops, collaborative research and teaching, symposia, study abroad and other programs.

Through the generous support of the Henry Luce Foundation, the Colleges have planned, coordinated and hosted several curriculum workshops to catalyze and focus AES planning across liberal arts campuses and allow interested faculty to share ideas and best practices. The 2011 and 2013 curriculum development workshops consisted of two days of guest speakers with expertise in Asian environmental studies, break out sessions to focus on specific topics, networking and other opportunities to share best practices. The target audience for the workshops was faculty from liberal arts campuses who teach about environmental issues in East Asia or who are planning to do so. The workshops assist faculty through the development of new courses or through modules in existing courses. Facilitators helped focus the workshops with questions designed to both identify broad themes and issue areas for AES, as well as look tactically on how those issues might be brought into AES classrooms in meaningful and challenging ways. Speakers at the curriculum workshops have included specialists from the China Environment Forum’s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Cornell University, Montana State University, University of California at Los Angeles, among others.

In 2012, the Colleges hosted its fifth biennial Half the World Symposium on Asian Environments as part of the AES Initiative at HWS. This interdisciplinary Symposium brings together scholars (including graduate students) whose work examines any aspect of human-environment interactions in East Asia (including Southeast and Northeast Asia). Speakers at the Half the World Symposium included specialists from American University, Bard College at Simon’s Rock, Bryant University, College of Wooster, Colgate University, Colorado College, Cornell University, ECOLOGIA, Denison University, Fairfield University, Green Mountain College, Middlebury College, Norwich University, Oregon State University, Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy – China, Ramapo College of New Jersey, Royal Roads University, Sidwell Friends School, Sonoma State University, Syracuse University, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences, University of North Carolina, University of San Diego, University of Washington, among others. Three papers presented at the 2012 Half the World Symposium were published in a special issue of ASIANetwork Exchange: A Journal for Asian Studies in the Liberal Arts, the peer-review journal of the ASIANetwork. HWS Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies and Director of the Asian Environmental Studies Initiative and Associate Professor of Environmental Studies Darrin Magee worked in collaboration with ASIANetwork Exchange editors Lisa Trivedi and Erin McCarthy to edit the special issue. 

The work of AES Initiative faculty has also enriched the HWS Center for Global Education office through various study abroad programs, including China, Taiwan and Vietnam. Each with their own focus, these study abroad programs offer HWS students unique experiences with Asian scientific, cultural and political dimensions, which greatly influence Asian response to local and global environmental crises. HWS has partnered with Peking University in Beijing, China; Nanjing University in Nanjing, China; and National Chengchi University in Taipei, Taiwan. 

East Asian Studies is especially relevant to environmental studies at HWS and other institutions of higher education due to the dynamic local and global forces impacting this region. It is impossible to seriously study global environmental issues and the challenges of sustainable development without considering the rapid economic and population growth of East Asia. Globalization has rapidly industrialized this region and attracted millions to mega-cities. The AES Initiative at HWS is innovative in its breadth in a liberal arts education, but it is also comes at a time when East Asia could incorporate more sustainable development principles, thereby greatly impacting quality of life and the environment in Asia and the globe for decades, if not centuries. 

Even though the grant from the Luce Foundation has now been expended, AES faculty continue to pursue several of the initiatives launched under the grant including speaker series and student research. We are also exploring the possibility of hosting curriculum workshops and symposia (including student symposia) in collaboration with other liberal arts institutions with strong Environmental Studies and Asian Studies programs that have received funding from the Luce Foundation.

In addition to the infrastructure implications, the peak demand charge makes up 40-50% of our electricity bill. This is why we focus on minimizing the power required by the university during the times we are most likely to hit peak. Peak occurs on campus sometime between 12:00pm and 5:00pm. Effectively managing that 30 minute period helps to drastically reduce electric costs.

The app visualizes current electricity use, and peak usage over time. Recommendations are also provided on the app for ways that individuals can help reduce peak demand electricity. On days when IU predicts that the campus may be close to peak, a notification is emailed to all campus users, advising them of energy use, and encouraging a variety of behaviors which may reduce this demand.",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/81/6/584/3278/IN%203%20-%20Energy%20Matters%20App.pdf,**,--,--,True,--,True,True,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,http://sustain.indiana.edu/programs/peak-load/peak-mobile-app.php,https://phy.aitapps.indiana.edu/phy_energymatters_v1_online/,--

Its main feature is the addition of organic waste collection bins to all recycling stations on campus. To our knowledge Penn State is one of the first schools of its size to offer
campus-wide composting. This program is expected to increase solid waste diversion by an additional 10%, to 75%. Employees will no longer have their trash cans emptied by custodial staff. Rather they are expected to sort their own waste at the mobius station. This is expected to raise awareness of the amount of waste produced, as well as reduce labor by custodial staff who instead will be managing material from the mobius stations. Compostable waste is transported to the Penn State Organic Materials Processing and Education Center, where it is ground, blended with organic matter from grounds maintenance and animal operations, composted, and either used by campus landscaping or sold to the public.

Pomona College,2016-01-11,2016-01-11 17:28:38,alexis.reyes@pomona.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Carbon Neutrality by 2030,"In 2007, Pomona College signed the American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). Pomona College began tracking and submitting a greenhouse gas emissions inventory in 2008. In 2009, the College created a Climate Action Plan, with modest goals of 26% reductions by 2020 and 75% reductions by 2050. However, with growing concerns about global climate change and recognizing Pomona College’s leadership capabilities, the President and Board of Trustees in May 2015 declared a commitment of carbon neutrality by 2030. Pomona College is updating our Climate Action Plan to include a comprehensive, strategic energy retrofit plan. We are expecting to complete the plan by May 2017. Pomona College’s largest greenhouse gas contributor is energy usage (70% for FY 2015 emissions). As such, Pomona College will prioritize efforts through energy conservation (behavior modification and elimination of use), energy efficiency (technology improvements), renewables (purchase and development of alternative energy sources), and offsets (third-party or off-campus offsetting of emissions).","Through our Climate Action Plan and aggressive Carbon Neutral 2030 commitment, Pomona College has experienced success in many areas of greenhouse gas reduction. Pomona College’s main sources of emissions (using FY 2015 as a reference) are energy usage (70%), college travel (18%), study abroad travel (6%) and commuting (4%). To address energy usage, Pomona College focuses on LEED standards for new construction and retrofitting existing buildings. Pomona College currently has 10 LEED certified buildings on campus. Most recently, Millikan Laboratory and Andrew Science Hall achieved a Platinum rating and received an award from LEED Los Angeles region for outstanding energy efficiency, scoring 32 out of 35 points in the Energy & Atmosphere category. As part of our Sustainability Action Plan (the plan that contains the Climate Action Plan), Pomona College completes an extensive Sustainability Annual Report. Compared to our 2008 baseline, Pomona College has reduced emissions by 16%. When comparing fiscal year (FY) 2015 levels to FY 2014, Pomona College has reduced emissions in each of the following categories: commuting by 25%, natural gas by 4%, study abroad travel by 3%, and college travel by 2%.

The project required collaboration from community members, city planners, and university staff and faculty, who all stood firmly behind the project through all stages of the project. When raising funds to purchase the building materials for the parklet proved challenging, students and PSU employees launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to close the funding gap. The project also received contributions and in-kind donations from local businesses.","22 architecture students were able to design and build Portland's first public parklet/mini park. Lost parking revenue from two public parking spaces was covered by the owner of the adjacent property, allowing the spaces to be transformed to create a community gathering space and enhanced place-making for the EcoDistrict. 

The parklet was made possible by the financial support of 141 donors, who contributed a total of $15,640 in cash and in-kind donations through a crowdfunding campaign earlier this year, an amount that helped to cover the cost of materials and other expenses.

The Fourth Avenue Parklet, designed with sustainability and stormwater management in mind, is composed of the following:

768 linear feet of sustainably harvested juniper
3,475 pounds of steel
250 linear feet of repurposed escalator handrail

The university will usually select the system with the lowest NPV.  The costs in the NPV analysis include the capital cost to install the system, energy cost, maintenance costs and the CO2 tax.  By applying this theoretical “tax,” the University places a monetary value on environmental impact, which in turn increases the “savings” by undertaking the efficient design.

This group of 500 first-year students all completed an Honors College first-year seminar entitled “The Sustainability Project,” lasting both the fall 2013 and spring 2014 semester. 
During the fall semester of the course, eight sustainability experts at Purdue gave students an overview of methods of approaching sustainability issues during bi-weekly lectures. Methods covered included community development, politics, engineering, and anthropology. On the weeks without lecture, students would divide into “discussion sections” of 10 to 20 students across disciplines. Here, an upper-class mentor would guide the students through discussions about the lecture and the completion of several small projects. 
During the spring semester, students met weekly with their “discussion section” groups to create and complete a large, semester-long sustainability project. Projects were of each group’s choosing, and each group was required to write a project proposal and create several videos promoting their project. Many groups elected to work with student organizations, local elementary schools, and nonprofit groups of all sizes; some groups performed research on campus sustainability and presented their research results to administrators.
At the conclusion of the spring semester, all 500 Honors students spent time discussing their sustainability group projects with attendees of Spring Fest, a large festival held on campus. Since the festival is geared toward children, the students created games and crafts that engaged the children and got them interested about sustainability projects on campus and in the community. Spring Fest achieved a record turnout in 2014, enabling the students to reach a massive community audience and share sustainability tips.

Rice University,2016-03-25,2016-03-25 16:32:45,rrj@rice.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Demand Response Programs Participation,"The Environmental Defense Fund defines demand response as “end-use customers reducing their use of electricity in response to power grid needs or economic signals from a competitive wholesale market.”  Rice University participates in several demand response programs that are available to customers in the deregulated ERCOT (Electricity Reliability Council of Texas) electricity market.  These programs include the ERCOT 30-minute Emergency Response Service (ERS-30) and the CenterPoint Energy Load Management Program.  In addition, Rice engages in 4CP management, which refers to the management of electrical usage on the coincident peak usage day for each of the four summer months (June, July, August, and September).   

The Environmental Defense Fund promotes demand response in saying that it “diverts money that would generally go to a fossil fuel power plant to homeowners and businesses instead.  In this scenario, a utility or demand response provider sends a message for participants to reduce electricity use at key times in exchange for a credit or rebate on their utility bill, in addition to the cost savings they will earn through conservation.”  Additional benefits identified by EDF include “enhanced reliability on the power grid, as well as curbing energy use during the hottest and coldest months, offsetting the need for expensive, inefficient, and dirty ‘peaker’ plants generally only used to generate power several dozen hours per year during these periods of extreme weather.”  See http://blogs.edf.org/californiadream/2014/04/21/demand-response-people-not-new-power-plants-are-driving-the-clean-energy-future/ ","Beginning in calendar year 2013, Rice continually contracts 3 megawatts of electricity capacity at minimum into demand response programs 24/7 across the entire calendar year.  This means that in a moment of distress on the electrical grid, Rice has pledged to shed 3 megawatts from its electrical import, thus helping to prevent rolling brown-outs in the community while also helping to keep the dirty peaker plants offline (or from even being built).  Rice employs a variety of strategies on campus in order to achieve this, including calls to conservation sent out via email to the entire campus community, changing building air conditioning schedules and temperature set-points, and fuel-switching to natural gas-fired cogeneration, which is considerably cleaner than coal-fired power plants.

Saint Louis University,2016-03-24,2016-03-24 17:17:42,bverhof1@slu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Strategic Planning and Culture Change Practice,"As a functional division, Facilities Services (FS) confronts numerous roadblocks when directing time and effort toward developing strategic and innovative practices. Typical for many Facilities divisions are the expectations that day-to-day functions are to be carried-out in a cost-effective manner while reserving capacity to react to unanticipated needs. The Facilities’ culture at Saint Louis University was one of being proud to be “behind the scenes” and “quietly effective”. Considering the lack of a University strategic plan and sustainability planning not even on the horizon, Facilities Services’ implementation of this initiative was especially transformative.

In 2010 we recognized that higher education will be addressing major trends requiring our division to be a proactive partner at our University. To this end, we instituted a strategic plan and culture change practice to reposition Facilities Services to be operationally excellent and strategically capable of contributing to the long term direction of the University. Facilities Services has worked diligently to develop the capability of staff to be strategic, building a culture of involvement, and executing towards measurable outcomes.   The division created five strategic initiatives to advance these efforts: strategic and operational effectiveness, stakeholder recognition, excellence in people, environmental resource optimization, and partnering. 

Each new fiscal year brings continued improvement, with Facilities Services strategic action teams taking ownership and advancing the division's strategic initiatives.  Notable improvement can be seen over the past five years primarily in the initiative, Environmental Resource Optimization. Two action teams that developed out of this initiative have been focused directly on campus sustainability:  “Waste Minimization” and “Energy and Utility Strategies”.  It is through these action teams that many of the campus sustainability initiatives have come to fruition through Facilities Services involvement with campus engagement, planning and coordination, recycling and waste reduction, energy and water reduction goals and improved measurement and performance.  Although the University has not identified sustainability as a strategic initiative, the Facilities Services Division has identified this as an important piece to advance the University and Division’s mission.","APPA, the Association for Leadership in Educational Facilities, selected Saint Louis University's Division of Facilities Services (FS) as a recipient of the 2014 Effective & Innovative Practices Award for their entry: Strategic Planning and Culture Change Practice.

In Penstemon 2.0, the project has pioneered a new approach to sustainability across the curriculum, based on suggestions over the years with the Penstemon Project for Sustainability Across the Curriculum. The heart of this approach is to deal with academic departments throughout SCU's schools and colleges, asking them to set their own goals for how many courses should include a sustainability component. ","The program has been piloted with a handful of departments, who discussed their own curricula and set their own goals. For example, Political Science decided that 50% of their courses should include a sustainability component. The Economics department committed to a goal of 35%, while Civil Engineering and Anthropology both committed to a goal of 75%. As further evidence of the innovative character of Penstemon 2.0, AASHE highlighted our approach during the Educating for Sustainability Webinar Series.

Arboreta are accredited at different levels depending on degrees of development, capacity, and professionalism. In addition to the Level I and Level II requirements, to achieve Level III ARBnet accreditation, an arboretum must have: 500+ labeled trees/woody plant species, paid management staff, a curator, substantial educational programming, collaboration with other arboreta, collections data sharing with networked collections, and agenda for tree science, planting and conservation. Smith College is the only higher education institution in New England to achieve Level III ARBnet accreditation.

The mission of the Botanic Garden of Smith College is to foster education about the science, beauty, and importance of the plant kingdom through the use of outdoor and conservatory plant collections, gardens, displays, and exhibitions, and to preserve and maintain the historic Olmsted campus landscape.","The Botanic Garden of Smith College was founded over one hundred years ago by L. Clarke Seelye, the College's first president, who expressed his hope that the whole campus could be developed as a botanic garden so that it might be of scientific as well as aesthetic value. The landscape architecture firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, of Central Park fame, was enlisted to create that plan.

Incorporating the study of plants into academics was an insightful idea in 1875, and it still is. The spirit of President Seelye's concept has persisted at Smith College and remains basic to our purpose. Today the Botanic Garden serves as a living museum of plants native to New England and ecosystems all around the globe.

Today, the Botanic Garden includes thousands of plants, including those grown under glass in the Lyman Conservatory and outdoors in the campus arboretum — our landscape for learning — and various specialty gardens around campus. Additionally, there are 60,000 pressed specimens available for research in the herbarium.

Botanic Garden activities and collections include not only plants but also books and other resource materials (including our newsletter, Botanic Garden News), an international seed exchange, research and conservation, and diverse events.

The first Food Summit, held in the fall of 2010, demonstrated the breadth and depth of interest in Food issues across the seven schools of the university (Medicine, Earth Sciences, Business, Humanities & Sciences, Law, Education, and Engineering). The target audience was primarily academics. The second and third Summits opened up the target audience to include community-based food groups/organizations, and included presentations of pilot collaborative research projects in the areas of Hospital Food, Food Bank Food, Farm to School Food, and Food Policy. The fourth Summit in 2013 provided a forum for focusing on Growing Pathways to Careers in Food Systems. This was in response to substantial input from Stanford students who wanted to learn more about the types of jobs and careers that are emerging in this dynamic area. More than two dozen speakers, many of them Stanford Alumni, discussed their jobs and careers in farming, food production, cooking, food procurement, food entrepreneurship/start-ups, food policy/social justice, and food and health.

For more details, please visit:
http://foodsummit.stanford.edu/","Positive and measurable outcomes associated with the various Food Summits at Stanford include the following:

1. Dining Hall Study
As a result of a collaboration between Debra Dunn (who taught Stanford's Sustainable Abundance class), Stanford Dining, and postdoctoral fellow Christoper Gardner (Food Summit founder), a study was conducted in four of the undergraduate dining halls to try to improve the healthfulness of student dining choices. The paper was published in 2013.

2. Food Helix
Because of the collegial and collaborative relationships fostered by the Food Summits, a group of 5 were selected by the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (VPUE) to attend Faculty College during the 2012-2013 academic year to develop a Food Helix in response to recommendations from the Study of Undergraduate Education at Stanford (SUES Report). The group has just been granted over $3,000 by the VPUE to initiate the implementation of the Food Helix.

3. Summer Farm Camp
During an afternoon breakout session of the first Food Summit in 2010, a Community-Academic partnership was started between Full Circle Farm (11-acre organic farm on the grounds of Peterson Middle School in Sunnyvale) and Stanford. Together the groups created a summer camp program that has enrolled over 100 children each of the last two years (the first year they enrolled ~80 kids). Three students have received Haas summer fellowships, seven students have received Human Biology HB-REX summer fellowships, and one student has received a CCSRE summer fellowship to be camp counselors/field researchers at the camps. This coming summer will mark the 4th consecutive year of this Community-Academic partnership. Three summer camp counselors wrote a manuscript covering the results of the 2011 farm camp. That manuscript is under review by the Journal of Nutrition Education and Communication.

4. Funds Raised by the Food Summits
Each of the first four Summits were funded by combinations of the Provost, the deans of the seven Stanford schools, the Woods Institute, and a few others. The funds raised each year have been in the range of $50,000/year. As a result of the visibility the Food Summit has brought to this topic and the outstanding scholars involved, various donors have contributed unrestricted gifts totaling $136,000 that have been used to fund the scholarly work done at Full Circle Farm Summer camp, Second Harvest Food Bank (see below), and other projects.

5. Collaboration with Second Harvest Food Bank
Drs. Randall Stafford and Lisa Goldman Rosas were awarded funds from the unrestricted gifts described above to work with Second Harvest Food Bank in working to optimize their organizational transition to providing more produce to the hungry people that they serve in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. A summary of this work was presented at the 2012 Food Summit 3.

6. New course created: Healthy and Sustainable Food Systems.
This quarter Professor Christopher Gardner started a new class (Hum Bio 113S) that arose directly from all the work he has done with colleagues for the past few years on topics covered at the Food Summits.

Academic entrepreneurship is more than a technology transfer process, it is a shift in academic culture that adds another dimension to higher education. The Office of Innovation & Entrepreneurship prepares the student for the entrepreneurial age.
Mission: To foster and promote Institute-wide innovative research & educational programs, and technology commercialization.
The university responds to societal needs:
1. Fosters innovation and entrepreneurial practices at all academic levels that benefit all stakeholders both internal and external
2. Prepares students to compete in an environment where jobs are scarce and business and entrepreneurial skills are critical for a successful career
3. Contributes to the growth of the local and regional economies
The Innovation Spine does not include only the ""Introduction to Entrepreneurship"" class but also Business plan competitions, summer internships, seminars, entrepreneurship minor, research programs.

The program also includes a course sequence that culminates in a senior capstone design project for all engineering students. Over the last couple years, through the I&E program, SIT has made an a deliberate effort to increase the number of sponsored senior design projects that have a strong environmental sustainability component. They have successfully executed a number of projects in both the energy domain and water treatment and quality. In fact, Stevens recently received a $5.0M award from the Department of Defense to investigate, using a systems approach, sustainability practices at Army Ammunition plants and investigate the utilization of wastewater streams generated in these facilities for the growth of algal biomass and its subsequent conversion to biofuel for the generation of renewable energy. This specific project will result in a number of senior design projects over the next four years.","The course ""Introduction to Entrepreneurship"" was designed to be student centric, with lively classroom discussion and group work, and an emphasis on learning by doing. Students identify problems, meet with customers and develop prototypes, and refine concepts as they gather more data. They learn to work in teams on their projects, develop presentation skills as they share what they have learned, and create YouTube videos for a potential Kickstarter audience. In fact, seven of those projects have been accepted by Kickstarter(Glove: http://kck.st/1k5S3Gu ,key case: http://kck.st/OrTtfu, and modustrip: http://kck.st/OEZG7Z.)

Below you can see the number of students who are involved with the I&E office programs:

1. Summer Scholars Research Program : 34 students will be supported this summer (81 applications processed)
2. Stevens Scholar I&E Summer Research: 109 students are paired with faculty advisors to conduct 6 weeks of summer research 
3. Stevens I&E Doctoral Fellows: 8 new fellows were admitted to the program for Fall 2013. A total of 30 doctoral fellows are currently supported
4. Student Elevator Pitch Olympics & Project Plan Olympics at I-Expo Day: Sixteen teams selected to compete – 8 in each category.

Finally, the office is planning on also establishing a new program for Innovation, Design and Entrepreneurship at Stevens (IDEaS). The mission of the program is to create a holistic innovation culture by integrating and intertwining design, research and entrepreneurship student learning experiences at Stevens. This is achieved through the newly developed design spine I&E courses (MGT 103 – Entrepreneurial Learning and E403/E404 – Innovation Workshop for senior design) and other planned I&E activities. The Prototype Object Fabrication (ProOF) Laboratory, that will be housed in the new Gateway building will be managed and operated by the IDEaS program.

After the spring that fed the lake dried up, the lake was filled by potable water.  

During the process of regular maintenance, it was determined that leaks in the structure and deterioration of the walls have led to continuing water loss. Due to the leaks, the lake had been drawing nearly 20 million gallons annually from the Columbus public water system.

As part of the university’s ongoing, comprehensive work to address sustainability across campus, the President and Provost’s Council on Sustainability endorsed the Mirror Lake Enhancement Study and secured funding from the University Sustainability Fund to initiate the study in 2013.  Faculty, staff, and students were involved in the design process to determine the methods to maintain the lake’s iconic status both aesthetically and culturally, best strategies to supply water that aligns with the university sustainability goals, and methods to improve maintenance and operational needs.
","The results of the study were completed and by late 2014 Mirror Lake’s feed source switched from domestic water to well water, reducing the amount of potable water being used by over 97%, saving the university over $45,000 a year while preserving the unique character of Mirror Lake.

Tulane City Center works with community groups throughout New Orleans to address difficult problems with good design.
Initiatives of the Tulane City Center share a focus on improving cities--particularly New Orleans. The project sites range in scale from small installations to neighborhood scale planning. The work is grounded in the values and culture of the community partners in dialogue with current environmental sensibilities and innovative design strategies. Beyond deep citizen engagement, an important aspect of the work is to ensure that the research results in a constructed design and/or advocacy and education.

Each project operates within one of five categories of work:

1. Architecture - The projects in this category address specific sites and structures. The built work in and around New Orleans seeks to bring high quality design to diverse environments while fostering a strong sense of community. Recent projects range in scale from small pavilions to designs for cultural centers. 

2. Design Build - Tulane School of Architecture's Engage-Design-Build program is a design studio offered every semester in which students design and build a full-scale, affordable, and sustainable project. Community partners are able to see small projects realized and students are given an opportunity to shepherd a project from design to completion. Projects have ranged from interior build-outs to a seven-acre farm. 

3. Planning - These are projects larger than one single building or site and address neighborhood or city-wide issues. Through good planning, Tulane City Center wants to ensure that the city's future is addressed with innovative means of public participation, research, education and critical thinking; building a healthier, more inclusive New Orleans. 

4. Graphic Advocacy - Community partners' projects benefit from advocacy through graphic design. Through visually compelling messages, Tulane City Center aims to communicate the spirit and goals of the community partners that reflect a shared commitment to promoting a just and equitable society.

5. Capacity Building - Tulane City Center aims to increase the capacity and effectiveness of individuals, non-profits and community groups through collaboration and design. Building organizational capacity is an investment in the future sustainability of a non-profit.

The goal of the Farm to SUNY initiative is to increase the procurement of fresh and minimally-processed New York-grown produce (e.g., potatoes, lettuce, leafy greens, tomatoes, squash, cabbage, and green beans) by SUNY campuses at a competitive price that provides a sustainable profit margin for farmers. It also includes an educational campaign to increase awareness among campus faculty, staff, and students on the benefits of purchasing locally grown meat, fruits, and vegetables. Farm to SUNY is funded by a $100,000 two-year grant through the American Farm Trust's Farm To Institution NYS Initiative (FINYS), a statewide partnership of agricultural, public health, and economic development partners who have come together to strengthen the state's farm and food economy while improving the health of its citizens.","- The creation of an educational campaign called ""Harvest of the Month,"" in which a minimally-processed items is highlighted in the dining halls for that month. 
- Two annual educational celebrations were established, including ""National Kale Day"" on October 7th and Day of the Mushroom on April 16th. Peer educators hold educational programs to help students understand the health benefits of each particular food and how much of the item we purchase locally. 
- In 2014, University at Albany led the committee to start ""Campus Crunch"" to celebrate National Food Day in late October. On that day, students from campuses across New York take celebratory bites into New York State Apples to affirm their commitment to increasing local food and increasing awareness of the campaign. At the second annual Campus Crunch in 2015, over 20 colleges and universities and over 6,000 faculty, staff and students took the crunch.

The Green Department Certification Grand Slam builds on the existing program, but uses an innnovative approach to try to double participation.  There is evidence that the amount of work needed to complete the checklist and the lack of student assistance has limited how many and how quickly departments can participate.  It is also possible that the open-ended nature of the certifications – with no deadlines or set timeframes – has meant that some department green teams have lost focus.  In order to directly address both of these constraints, this year the Office of Sustainability implemented a new process of certification that included student liaisons between campus departments and the Office of Sustainability and also set an end of the year deadline for a department to be certified.  The establishment of Green Teams with students, faculty, and staff has provided a unique opportunity for collaboration within the campus and has increased awareness and understanding of sustainability issues.

Cooling towers are a major water consumer of potable water on campus. The projects ultimately reduce potable water consumption at the towers by 80%. It also enabled UCSD to install a new private 12"" reclaimed water pipeline on campus, which stretches nearly a mile. This pipeline will also be used to replace potable irrigation with reclaimed irrigation. 
   
UCSD has two main central utilities plants. The main Central Utilities Plant (CUP) is the larger of the two (30 MW cogeneration with 17,000 ton cooling capacity) and provides electricity, cooling, and heating for a large portion of the campus. The CUP is one of the major water consumers on campus, mostly due to the cooling towers. The East Campus Central Utilities Plant (ECUP) is smaller plant with 3,000 ton cooling. The ECUP reclaimed water retrofit project was completed in May 2015. The success of this project motivated UCSD to perform similar retrofits at the main CUP, where much more significant water saving was promised. The CUP reclaimed water retrofit is expected to be completed in February 2016. 

ECUP Reclaimed Water Cooling Tower Retrofit was completed in May 2015. ECUP has four cooling towers with an average make-up water demand of 27,500 gpd (30 AFY). The retrofit project brought reclaimed water from the City of San Diego’s recycled water distribution system to ECUP cooling towers to offset potable water make-up. The project required site piping upgrades, new controls, and chemical treatment system. Upon project completion, UCSD started with 20% reclaimed and 80% blend of reclaimed to potable make-up at the towers. Within a few months this ratio was increased to 80% reclaimed and 20% potable. Since August 2015, ECUP tower make-up has been kept at this ratio of reclaimed to potable. This has reduced potable demand by 80% at ECUP towers.

The CUP reclaimed water cooling tower retrofit project brings reclaimed water from UCSD north campus connection to the City of San Diego’s recycled water distribution system to feed the UCSD Central Utilities Plant (CUP) via a newly installed 12-inch private recycled water main that stretches near a mile on campus. The mainline distribution system installation was completed in summer of 2015. The CUP retrofit is expected to be complete by end of February 2016. The CUP contains seven existing cooling towers with an average make-up water demand of approximately 435,600 gpd (or 488 AFY). This project will provide reclaimed water to offset 200 AFY of potable water. The recycled water piping for the connection to the cooling towers are routed below grade into the CUP yard and will continue below grade to the new above grade meter, pressure regulating valve, and flow control assembly. The towers remained operational while the new piping were installed. The piping work was carried out in accordance with the procedures specified in the City of San Diego recycled water specifications.

In order to minimize construction impacts on campus during construction of the pipeline, the majority of the pipeline was constructed using horizontal directional drilling (HDD) method. Collaboration was a key to successful design and construction. During design stages, the engineering team worked closely with Facilities Management personnel including plant operators, managers, and the Grounds and Landscaping department to collect their requirements and feedback. As a University, UCSD values safety and the importance of operations on campus. During construction it was very important to coordinate with faculty, staff, the parking and transportation department, as well as building occupants to minimize impacts. Considering the footprint of the pipeline project, which was near 1 mile, the impact was minimal on campus operations. Various teams worked together closely to make this happen. The project team also worked closely with the City and County for plan approval as well as construction inspections. 

One of the specialties of the UCSD’s Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) department is in training and outreach to the campus on reclaimed water use. EH&S enforced signage installation in places where reclaimed water is used. Additionally, central plant operators receive training on all aspects of reclaimed water. The Sustainability Office worked with University Communications, EHS and Facilities Management to communicate both on and off-campus about the reclaimed water project.","The cooling towers at UCSD Central Utilities Plant (CUP) account for about 25% of the total water consumption on campus. The cooling tower retrofit projects offset 80% of this potable demand, which results in approximately 20% reduction in total potable water consumption on campus. All told we will save an estimated 8 million gallons at the ECUP and anticipated 97 million gallons per year at the CUP. Reducing potable water demand and consumption is crucial to California. UCSD has committed to water reduction and efficiency projects over the past years. Assuming that the cost of reclaimed water is $3.50/HCF and potable water at $7/HCF, the ECUP reclaimed water cooling tower retrofit is estimated to save $38,000 annually and the CUP reclaimed water cooling tower retrofit $454,000 annually.

"University of California, Santa Barbara",2016-03-23,2016-03-23 16:14:52,mo@geog.ucsb.edu,2.0,Pursuing,A Voluntary Additional 12% Reduction in Potable Water Use,"Amid a historic drought in California, Governor Jerry Brown declared a sweeping and comprehensive water reduction goal in January 2014; urban water districts were to achieve a combined 25% reduction in potable water consumption by March 1, 2016, measured against aggregated water use for the combined districts for calendar year 2013. Water districts were assigned percentages based on established conservation efforts and per capita consumption numbers, awarding those with robust efforts and low per capita consumption numbers with lower reduction targets. Goleta Water District, UC
Santa Barbara's local water purveyor, was assigned a 12% reduction. UCSB saw this as an opportunity to support Goleta Water District in their conservation endeavors and voluntary adopted the 12% reduction goal for the campus, along with the immediate timeframe. The adoption of this goal was a first for the University, never had the campus established such a goal with a short timeframe. However, as the March 1, 2016 deadline quickly approached, UCSB not only met, but exceeded the voluntary 12% reduction goal with a 15% reduction in potable water use.

UCSB utilized a multi-faceted approach to achieve this goal, but most importantly first took the risk of adopting such a demanding goal. Recent conservation efforts have been made in all water use sectors on-campus, academic, administrative, and residential buildings, landscape and irrigation, and industrial applications. UCSB's ability to divide conservation and efficiency projects between sectors has allowed the campus to develop a robust and permanent water conservation program. Sweeping upgrades to more water efficient applications in labs, the continued expansion of the recycled water
infrastructure, and the replacement of old water-intensive mechanical equipment with new efficient models are just some of the strategies that have been utilized to achieve this reduction. In many ways the adoption of this goal helped to push our programs beyond their current limits and boundaries, and encourage us to reach higher up the tree in regards to water conservation and efficiency efforts.

The adoption of a voluntary water goal with a short timeframe has not been done by another institution of higher education in California. When the goal was adopted by the campus, it was uncertain whether it was achievable or not, but the campus accepted that the risk of not adopting the goal and the message it could potentially send to the local community was far greater than the campus adopting the goal and not achieving it. In addition, the desire to adopt such as goal was, again not so much to achieve it, but to exemplify that we are united with our local water district's conservation efforts and the efforts of Californians statewide. The partnership between colleges and universities and local agencies is essential for successful programs, and UCSB believed this was the perfect way to demonstrate our relationship with Goleta Water District. In addition, UCSB has long believed that behavior modification is essential to achieving long-term savings from conservation and efficiency programs, and the campus saw the voluntary adoption of a water goal as a means to solidify this belief and remind our own campus community of our obligations to save water.

Risks, especially around establishing goals, are difficult for colleges and universities to accept, but to get beyond our current programs and practices, taking these risks are necessary. The adoption of this goal is a prime example of how a college or university can utilize a calculated risk as a driver to improve their programs and practices, and achieve impressive results.","Once the goal was officially adopted by the campus, strategic messaging to the campus community and outside community took place to ensure the language surrounding the adoption of a voluntary goal was appropriate, and similar to the message in the community. In regards to the conservation efforts associated with the goal, the education and outreach of this effort was critical. Behavior modification through education and outreach efforts is essential; however, a common problem that many organizations face is how we tell our communities to save water without repeating the same message every year. With constant collaborative efforts with our Sustainability Change Agent Communications team, we were able to revamp media formats that we have found historically successful with new messaging. We partnered with Goleta Water District to redesign our recycled water signs so they matched the signs being provided to the greater community, and we redesigned the messaging for our bus ads and movie trailers, which we opted to run for another year due to their impact on the greater Santa Barbara community. We utilized our mobile traffic display boards to display water conservation phrases that have been used by the State in an effort to reinforce the message on the campus. As previously stated, a public forum on water conservation and efficiency efforts was held to solicit feedback on how we could improve our practices. This forum was led by the Water Conservation Manager for the campus, as well a faculty member from the Environmental Studies department. With around 30 attendees from the campus community and outside community, feedback was diverse, which was important. After the establishment of the goal, Sustainability staff increased water conservation-related tours on campus and focused on tours to departments that may not have a strong sustainability knowledge-base.

Determining the number of individuals reached by our program is difficult. Estimating, we believe that we were able to reach close to 20,000 people. This is a conservative estimate because although we were able to provide workshops, forums, tours, and meetings to a specific number of individuals, our outreach efforts such as tabling, bus ads, movie ads, news articles, social media posts, and signage could have reached 20,000+ people on campus and in the community.

University of Colorado Colorado Springs,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 11:35:37,lkogan@uccs.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Sustainability Added to Campus-wide General Education Requirements,"In the last 3 years, UCCS has made the decision to add Sustainability as a requirement in its General Education Requirements for all students.
 All students entering the university as first year students in academic year 2015 are required to fulfill a sustainability requirement before graduation.
The UCCS GE Goals approved in include the following:
""Goal 3) Act and Interact. Students will cultivate self-awareness and understanding of their impact-locally, nationally, and globally. Students will be prepared to participate effectively in a society that encompasses diverse experiences, perspectives, and realities. This area includes [among others]:

    Sustainability-understanding the interaction between human development and the natural environment""



In order to achieve the terms of this goal, students will learn about key principles of sustainability including social equity, environmental protection, and economic development, among others. The sustainability GE goal will be achieved by integrating teaching about sustainability within discipline-specific coursework and/or other GE components, or in general elective courses.

Integrated content and/or courses will vary across disciplines and will examine the integrative nature of the sustainability concept to their disciplinary work. Ideally, students will gain knowledge about how to promote sustainability in their community and/or place of employment (e.g. support diversity, environmental activities such as recycling, reduction of waste, etc.).
Many schools have numerous sustainability course offerings but few have sustainability as a requirement for graduation.
",Initial outcomes from development of this requirement are increased numbers of sustainability courses being offered. There is an obvious incentive to include sustainability in a faculty member's course as it will increase the chances of that course filling.It will be listed in the course catalog as meeting the sustainability requirement.  Also there have been several educational seminars offered this year to help faculty incorporate sustainability into their particular coursework. The goal will to be to hold at least 2 curriculum workshops each year with the goal of giving faculty more tools for incorporating sustainability. ,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/90/6/584/3278/EC%20letterhead%20UCCS%20STARS%207%202014.pdf,**,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,http://www.uccs.edu/provost/compass-curriculum.html#Program%20Overview,--

That the University provided enough funding to finance the flight and hotels for each of the 18 participants is very unique and was made possible due to the collaborative efforts between the faculty and the staff to design an educational programming plan aligned with the values and mission of the University.  Among the events attended while in Paris, was a higher education networking event that the University arranged and co-hosted along with Second Nature, the Kedge Business School, and AASHE. Furthermore, the students who attended the trip have each proposed and pursued projects through which they can engage the larger UConn community in issues related to sustainability and climate change issues and to educate their peers about the lessons they learned as a result of the UConn @ COP21 experience.","The projects that the students are working on individually vary in content, media, and scope and include all of the following:

- Developing a social media account highlighting the socio-political side of climate issues
- Working with the campus Athletics department to better engage athletes, the Athletics department, and athletic facilities in sustainability
- Organizing a new student groups that brings together members from a variety of different environmentally-focused organizations in order to create an online eco-magazine and facilitate sustainability training programs for students
- Producing a podcast series that includes interviews from UConn @ COP21 participants and other representatives outside of the University that attended events or sites associated with COP21 in order to educate the wider UConn community about the history and importance of climate issues as well as the outcomes of the COP
- Exhibiting photography and brief reflections from Paris in an on-campus art exhibit in an effort to convey visually the issue of climate change and the importance of COP21
- Comparing sustainability initiatives implemented in Paris with those implemented at UConn in a photo series in order to demonstrate both the progress the University has made and the disparity between US and European cities in combatting environmental issues
- Filming and showing a documentary comprised of a series of interviews with individuals who attended COP-related events to provide new perspectives on environmental issues, both on a global and a University scale
- Instituting an annual fundraiser geared towards an advancement in renewable energy generation for the University
- Compiling into an informative video a series of tips and lifestyle changes college-aged students can make in order to lead healthier and more sustainable lives
- Connecting local companies with the University to organize mobile, interactive, pop-up art exhibits in and around campus
- Working with the University to adopt more sustainable land-use practices and to replace farmed turf grass and other commercially available plants with native, carbon-sequestering vegetation
- Creating a visual display that highlights the number of species facing extinction as a direct result of rising global temperature

In addition to the individual projects that the students are working on in the aftermath of the COP21 trip, all participants are working towards two larger, multidisciplinary projects to advance sustainability and climate action at the University.  The first is the pursuit for a divestment campaign at the University that would be peopled with the members of various different student groups as well as faculty and that would aid the University in reaching its 2050 emissions targets outlined in the Climate Action Plan.  The second project involves further incorporating sustainability into the University’s core curriculum in order to reach a broader range of students and to emphasize the interdisciplinary and global nature of sustainability issues.

Acquired in the 1960's the UHCC aims to support environmental research on the Texas coast by providing researchers with access to field sites, equipment and facilities. Facilities include two micrometeorology towers, a greenhouse, a laboratory building, and a maintenance building. The UHCC also seeks to broaden public awareness about science and the environment by supporting outreach activities with public groups and educational organizations.

Prior to World War II, the UHCC area was dominated by tall-grass prairie. In the 1940s, the area was used as Camp Wallace, resulting in human disturbance to portions of the prairie and the introduction of non-native species. Current land management goals include maintaining the areas of pristine prairie and restoring areas invaded by invasive species or disturbed by human activity. While much of the above can be considered impactful to sustainability, an ongoing innovative effort coming from the center is a seed distribution program, detailed below.","As a community service and ecological commitment, UH allows the seeds from the pristine patches of the Coastal Center to be harvested by the Native American Seed company and other groups, which are then made available to organizations and individuals engaged in prairie restoration and native plant projects all across the country. Given the highly-endangered habitat, with less than 0.1% remaining worldwide, the preservation and reintroduction of these seeds is vital to preserving this unique ecosystem and biodiversity.

In addition to the Native American Seed company, which sells the rare seed commercially (20% of the earnings go back to the coastal center), some seeds are also collected by Texas Master Naturalists to grow mature plants. These adult plants are used in local restoration projects. Finally, some seeds are also sent to the Katy Prairie Conservatory's (a separate conservation agency) ""Great Grow Out"", which is a program where community volunteers of all ages grow prairie plants for use in restoration projects.

As such, the Sustainability Strategic Thinking Advisory Committee and Sustainability Strategic Thinking Steering Committee have been charged with overseeing this process.   The goals of the SST process are to view the sustainability of UIC in areas beyond ecology and the environment, such as economics, resources, and social equity.  The SST process was approached by created a two-phase approach to Sustainability Strategic Thinking, one of which being the assets-based approach.  The assets-based approach was adapted from the Field Museum’s work engaging Chicago communities in sustainability and climate action, which adapted asset-based community development methodologies.  This method for developing a tailored sustainability integration strategy takes UIC’s particular strengths in sustainability for crafting a plan for sustainability.  Assets in the areas of research, operations, curriculum, and community were identified and analyzed by the Office of Sustainability and the Working Groups to define a set of asset matrices. The end result of assets-based approach to Sustainability Strategic Planning revealed a wide assortment of individuals, programs, centers, courses, research, activities and projects that contribute to sustainability across campus.  Because campus sustainability needs broad innovation and continuous improvement, the university must become a learning organization with nearly everyone publicly engaging and learning.  By increasing pride in what we are doing now, we increase excitement and engagement in sustainability because people begin to see what of their work and what they care about is connected to sustainability.

Currently, SST Committee members are identifying campus stakeholders in the following classifications: Research, Teaching & Learning, Economic Development, Community Engagement, and Campus Climate.

University of Louisville,2016-02-13,2016-02-13 03:02:56,justin.mog@louisville.edu,2.0,Pursuing,University of Louisville's Leigh Ann Conn Prize for Renewable Energy,"The University of Louisville created the Leigh Ann Conn Prize for Renewable Energy in 2012. This biannual award is intended to spur interest and innovation in renewable energy by acknowledging, publicizing and disseminating outstanding ideas and achievements in research related to the science, engineering, technology and commercialization of renewable energy. Nominations may address a wide range of topics involving renewable energy and energy efficiency with a demonstrated or clear potential global impact. The award is designed to recognize and reward the impact of specific ideas or achievements, rather than a lifetime of achievements in the field.

The Leigh Ann Conn Prize in Renewable Energy consists of the award of a medal and a cash prize of $50,000. The prize is awarded biannually on odd numbered years, with the winners invited to speak about their work at free public lectures on UofL's campus. The prize was established in 2012 by UofL alumnus Hank Conn and his wife Rebecca in memory of their daughter, Leigh Ann.

Ideas eligible for nomination may have an individual author or multiple authors; however, the total cash prize would be shared in the case of multiple authors. The competition does not limit the format in which the idea or achievement appears. Consideration is given to documentation appearing in printed books and monographs, articles published in scholarly journals, technological advances, software, research reports, conference presentations, patent documents or other widely and publicly disseminated forms. Consistent with the intent of prize benefactors, Hank and Rebecca Conn, the award is not given posthumously.

In November 2015, it was announced that world-renowned chemist Daniel Nocera, the Patterson Rookwood Professor of Energy at Harvard University, had won the 2015 Leigh Ann Conn Prize for Renewable Energy from the University of Louisville, which recognizes outstanding renewable energy ideas and achievements with proven global impact.

Nocera is recognized for two energy storage creations. The first is his “Artificial Leaf,” a renewable energy device that synthetically duplicates the direct solar-to-fuel steps of photosynthesis, the process by which plants use sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen to create fuel for themselves. The Artificial Leaf was named Innovation of the Year for 2011 by Time magazine.

The second is a low cost, rechargeable “flow” battery for scalable centralized (grid) and distributed (microgrid) energy storage at the megawatt-hour (MWh) scale. Nocera’s innovations address the storage of energy until needed, the most critical challenge of widespread implementation of renewables.

In August 2014, Lockheed Martin purchased the assets of his company, Sun Catalytix, including the associated flow battery invention, and is fast-tracking this technology at the MWh scale under the new venture Lockheed Martin Advanced Energy Storage, LLC. The energy storage cost using Nocera’s flow battery is half that of traditionally used vanadium-based flow batteries.

In March 2016, Dr. Nocera will give a free public talk in Louisville about his winning work. He will receive the Conn Prize medal and $50,000 award at the formal Leigh Ann Conn Prize Laureate ceremony. UofL President James Ramsey, who will confer the award, said “Dr. Nocera is a world class scientist addressing the grand challenges of making energy conversion and storage more efficient and economically viable. The University of Louisville values his research, and we are proud that he is the 2015 winner of the Leigh Ann Conn Prize.”

The prize, managed by UofL’s Conn Center for Renewable Energy Research at the J.B. Speed School of Engineering, is named for the late daughter of Hank and Rebecca Conn, who are center supporters and the prize benefactors. “Dr. Nocera is an astute global thinker working to bring energy to the world, especially in developing nations,” Hank Conn said. “This battery technology shows vision arising from highly diverse, yet targeted expertise. His work parallels the initiatives and scientific endeavors at UofL’s Conn Center.”

The inaugural prize was won in 2013 by Swiss chemist Dr. Michael Graetzel, developer of a new solar cell that is easier and less costly to produce than silicon-based cells. Graetzel, professor and director of the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, is recognized for merging nanoscience with photoconversion by developing the dye-sensitized solar cell, known as the “Graetzel cell.” These cells convert sunlight into electricity using earth-abundant materials at efficiencies exceeding thin-film silicon-based cells; however, production costs are dramatically lower. Mass production began in 2009. 

“Recognizing renewable energy innovations of such high caliber is a wonderful way to memorialize Leigh Ann,” Hank Conn said. “We are excited because the science is proven and it’s being translated into the world. The choice of Michael Graetzel mirrors the work conducted at the Conn Center and reinforces everything we’ve strived for these past five years. She would be proud.”",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/77/6/584/3278/Innovation%20Letter%20of%20Affirmation%20-%20Conn%20Prize.pdf,**,--,True,True,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,http://leighannconnprize.com/,--

While many of the top universities in the country offer individual courses in ecotourism or certificates or graduate degrees in sustainable tourism, no undergraduate degree in tourism and hospitality offers such a comprehensive integration of sustainability values and a triple-bottom line approach holistically across the entire curriculum. 

Work on the revised curriculum began in 2010 and has been guided by champions of sustainable hospitality and responsible tourism, such as Hervé Mr. Houdré, General Manager, InterContinental Barclay Hotel in New York, New York and Dr. Pauline Sheldon, Professor Emerita at the School of Travel Industry Management, University of Hawaii, The new curriculum features a fundamental shift in the program’s mission, a dozen new courses, and a holistic integration of sustainability principles.
An indicative list of courses are listed below:
•	Introduction to Sustainable Development
•	Corporate Social Responsibility
•	Sustainable Hotel Operations
•	Tourism Impacts and Alternatives
•	Sustainable Food and Beverage
•	Greening Hotel Facilities
•	Sustainable Travel and Transportation, and 
•	Sustainable Destination Planning and Management

The potential impact of graduates of this program is significant for theis important industry. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, 1.09 billion people traveled in 2013 and 1.8 billion travelers are forecast for 2030. With US$1.4 trillion in global exports, the international tourism and hospitality sector is one of the largest contributors to the world economy. The tourism and hospitality sectors employ more than 200 million people worldwide—one in every 11 workers—and account for over 10 percent of all consumer spending.

UNCG is the first American university to merge the business and sustainability principles facing the hospitality and tourism industry into a program of study. It is hoped to serve as a prototype for other similar degree programs.

In March 2013, the University of South Florida (USF) and Busch Gardens entered into a creative agreement to re-use campus Oak and Palm trimmings (known as browse) and occasionally full trees that require removal from the campus grounds. These materials are taken by Busch Gardens to provide fresh food for many of the animals and the large tree limbs are used to enhance the animal habitats. Thus far 13,350 cubic feet, or 494 cubic yards, of material have been diverted from landfills as a result of this partnership.

Many of the animals at Busch Gardens are leaf eaters. Ensuring they have a safe and adequate supply of fresh leaves is an important part of maintaining the excellent health of the animals. There are not many commercial sources for this type of food. On the one and a half square mile campus, USF frequently needs to trim trees that the animals love to eat. The result is a mutually beneficial partnership. The disposal fees and landfill use for USF are reduced and Busch Gardens receives a free source of fresh browse material for the animals.

The primary recipients of the USF browse currently are the kangaroos, hippos, gorillas, and elephants. Sometimes branches are given to the big cats, who pounce and play with them. In addition, mature trees must occasionally be removed from the USF Tampa campus; these are then re-purposed to provide natural climbing structures and habitat enrichment for the Busch Gardens animals.

University of Virginia,2015-12-11,2015-12-11 14:05:53,art2k@Virginia.edu,2.0,Pursuing,UNESCO World Heritage Site & Historic and Cultural Significance,"The original Jefferson designed Academical Village of UVa is a shared UNESCO World Heritage site with Monticello and serves at the spiritual and cultural center for the University campus. The Academical Village is also listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and is a National Historic Landmark. While these are exceptional, even unique qualifications, this innovation credit focuses on the continual work underway to support and improve the Academical Village physically and culturally and while improving public accessibility to the resources it provides.   
","The Academical Village at the University of Virginia is one of the most iconic architectural sites in America, but time, constant use and the elements have left the Grounds in need of a full renovation and repair. The University is renovating the Jeffersonian Grounds to ensure they remain true to the University’s original, central purpose to engage, connect and inspire students and faculty, learners and scholars.

Rotunda Renovation
The Rotunda was partially renovated once, almost 40 years ago. It has been more than 108 years since it was rebuilt by McKim, Mead & White (following the substantial destruction of Jefferson’s building by fire). Time and the elements have left the building in need of extensive repairs, and the project also provides for new uses to make the building more accessible to students and the public once complete. In the summer of 2013 UVa replaced the roof and restored the masonry and windows on the drum of the building. The next phase, which will last two years, began in May 2014 and includes:
•Complete structural and infrastructural renovation
•Increased classroom, study, lecture and ceremonial use
•Replacement of the marble column capitals
•Repair of the terraces and marble stairs
•Historic landscapes around the Rotunda
•New visitor interpretive center
•Renovation of the Dome Room

Renovating the Pavilions  
The Pavilions house University faculty who live side by side with our Lawn students, preserving Jefferson’s original intention to create an “Academical Village.” 

Conserving our Historic Gardens and Landscapes  
The historic Pavilion gardens, Lawn, alleys and associated landscapes of the Jeffersonian Grounds serve as parks and contemplative space for all U.Va. students, faculty and staff as well as visitors to the Grounds.

Restoring the Lawn and Range  
One distinction of the University of Virginia remains the Jeffersonian community of students on the Lawn and Range. Daily life is hard on 200-year-old buildings, and the lawn has been restored while the Range restorations are ongoing.  

Restoring the Hotels  
The Hotels of the Range once housed dining halls. The hotel keepers provided board and daily services to the students. Today they house offices, a student organization, and both faculty- and student-oriented dining facilities. 

Repairing the Colonnades  
Years of accumulated paint have trapped moisture and threaten the integrity of the supporting columns, which still house original Jeffersonian brick. The West Colonnade from Pavilion IX to V is next to be restored.

Other important priorities for the Jeffersonian Grounds include conducting archaeological studies, conserving architectural artifacts and increasing students’ daily use of the Rotunda.

This is the first program of its type nationally and has received accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission.

The environmental engineering technology degree program, specifically, will produce graduates with the skill sets to work with any Wisconsin (or national) manufacturer looking toward increasing the efficiency of raw material usage, reducing toxics, eliminating wastes, and lessening the environmental footprint of the materials being manufactured. 

The program enhances financial sustainability of the prospective student by allowing them to undertake the general education and basic groundwork courses at technical or two-year University of Wisconsin schools (typically less expensive than a comprehensive 4-year institution) and transfer those credits to the comprehensive university for degree completion.

The idea came about by analyzing the waste stream and figuring out how to reduce the campus' impact. The obstacle for this program was finding the partner to accept large quantities of plastic wrap that are otherwise not recycled through the campus' waste service provider. After several attempts to reach out to various organizations, it was discovered that the plastic wrap could be recycled in large quantities at a local big-box grocery store. This partnership was established by the part-time employee and the material which is collected monthly is delivered to the grocery store by the part-time employee and student intern. 

The program initially focused on receiving areas to collect plastic wrap from palleted boxes and other items. In November of 2015 this program expanded to include collection bins on campus where campus community members could recycle their plastic bags and plastic wrap.","This program began in January of 2015 and has resulted in 50-100 lbs of plastic wrap being recycled each month, rather than being landfilled.

The Storefront for Community Design is Richmond’s non-profit design assistance center, improving the quality of design in the city by facilitating access to design and planning resources.

MoB is a partnership of three design departments of VCUarts, Graphic Design, Fashion Design and Interior Design. These departments operate an innovative design lab that realizes the potential of design to shape the City.

MoB+Storefront is a collaboration of MoB and Storefront that combines the energy, enthusiasm and expertise of VCU students, fellows and faculty with Storefront’s community involvement. Together they design the city from the bike rack to the bungalow to the corner store, from neighborhoods to the river.

In partnership with the VCU Office of Sustainability, students from mOb created a design for the new High Output Learning Garden to be built on our Monroe Park Campus in Fall of 2015. The design was created with the intention of meeting the needs of all partners on the project: The Office of Sustainability, The Office of Service Learning, the Center for High Blood Pressure, the VCU Food Pantry (the RamPantry), two student organizations (Verde and Green Unity), and the VCU School of Pharmacy. They created innovative ways to grow vertically, maximize the space for high output, and create a beautiful design for fostering learning and community. These aspects met both the educational and high output missions of the partners. The students also ensured that the facilities were ADA accessible, including pathway width requirements and bed access. Overall the process left all the partners excited for the building of the garden and the execution of the programs.    ","The most significant outcome of this innovative partnership was the design and work done by the MoB students. This includes site plans and facilities designs for a learning area, bed materials, vertical planters, and ADA pathways. The students also executed a topographical survey and sunlight path survey.

Warren Wilson College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:30:09,aclimo@warren-wilson.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Warren Wilson College Farm #1 in the nation,"The Warren Wilson College Farm, established in 1894 when the Asheville Farm School was founded, has won numerous awards over the years in addition to producing a lot of delicious farm-to-table food. Now it has received another major accolade: No. 1 college farm in the nation.

In a feature titled “The 20 Best College Farms,” Best College Reviews ranks the WWC Farm at the top of the list. Ranking criteria include farm size; integration with the campus; sustainability; courses taught at the farm; students using the farm; and integration with the larger community.

“This award for our college farm is an affirmation to the commitment the College has shown to our working farm for well over a century,” said Farm Manager Chase Hubbard, a 1995 Warren Wilson graduate.

The 275-acre WWC Farm is sustainably managed by two staff managers with the help of a large student work crew – one of more than 100 student work crews on the Warren Wilson campus. In addition to providing much of the food for the Warren Wilson dining hall, WWC’s mixed-crop and livestock farm sells beef, pork, chicken and lamb to the surrounding community twice each year. Corn, wheat, barley and oats are grown in rich bottomland soils in rotation with an alfafa-based hay mix. No pesticides or herbicides are used in the farm’s crop production.

“The level of complexity of our farming operations is well beyond that of a typical college farm,” Hubbard said, “and the commitment our students show to mastering these complex tasks is inspiring.

“Spanning 365 days each year – in all weather and all times of day and night – Warren Wilson students are doing the things that make our farm a leader in higher education.”
","• Intensive rotational grazing
• Pasture-farrowing of swine herd
• Grass-finishing beef to produce omega-3 fatty acids and CLAs (cancer-fighting fats)
• Growing crops from non-GMO seed in four- or five-year rotation

• Raising pastured poultry
• Operating a weather data station with solar panel and wireless transmission

Western Michigan University,2016-02-24,2016-02-24 12:21:43,jeffrey.spoelstra@wmich.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Social Learning Model and Community Sustainability Incubator,"Western Michigan University and its Office for Sustainability apply social learning to leverage behavioral change and bridge the “gap” between people’s stated aspirations for a sustainable world and their generally unsustainable actions. With every project, we create open, cross-college and/or community collaborations that build durable and ongoing relationships, which support the development of new sustainability champions. To avoid creating a patchwork of disconnected projects, we use strategic incrementalism to create a framework where each project dovetails into another, like a bee’s honeycomb.

To successfully act on our President’s call to build a culture of sustainability, we recognized that we needed a coherent, systems-based approach to model sustainability and drive continuous improvement. Our “learning for sustainability” foundation includes three key elements of the formal education process: 1) Content – What do we teach?; 2) Pedagogy – How do we teach?; and, 3) Context – How do we model our values and our commitments in all facets of university policy and practice? As we work to re-imagine the purpose and promise of higher education, we pay particular attention to the underdeveloped element, context, as we build our culture of sustainability.

Sustainability is both a process and an end goal.  As we pursue it, we want anyone who encounters the WMU community to recognize an interdisciplinary, collaborative, and discovery driven experience. This level of fully integrated sustainability, one that “strikes” you as you step foot on campus and stays with you when you leave, requires long-term commitments that draw together campus operations, research, academic affairs, business and finance, administration, and the broader community. 

We apply social learning when conducting projects in pursuit of our overall sustainability goals. Our strategies are to:

-Identify and help implement innovative and cost-effective strategies for reducing WMU’s ecocultural wake, which span all of our policies, programs, and activities;
-Facilitate interdisciplinary and cross-college collaboration, research, and inquiry around sustainability;
-Encourage and support weaving sustainability and climate change education into existing curriculum;
-Support active learning and real-world problem solving through student sustainability research, internships, and co-curricular activities;
-Graduate knowledgeable, open-minded, well-prepared, and engaged planetary stewards; and,
-Serve as a resource and advocate for sustainability on campus and in the community, region, and state.

Planning, best practice review, fundamental behavioral analysis research, pilot testing, and other related efforts are guided by working groups of faculty, staff, administrators, community stakeholders, and most importantly undergraduate and graduate students. In each case, the Office for Sustainability (OfS) references and leverages university sustainability commitments and a growing network of sustainability leaders rooted in the President’s Universitywide Sustainability Committee (PUSC) and OfS student programs. The PUSC includes representatives from all seven colleges, major operations units, and both undergraduate and graduate students.

Four major projects demonstrate our approach to modeling sustainability in everything we do.  We are pursuing carbon neutrality, fostering a groundswell of faculty efforts to infuse sustainability and climate change themes into both curriculum and research, linking sustainability to university strategic plan implementation efforts, and collaborating with the community to expand awareness of sustainability and climate change and support regional planning for a living local economy that improves quality of life for all.

Our social learning approach is constantly evolving but guides how we tackle individual projects that have more concrete timelines and deliverables. New ideas or potential improvements on existing policies or practices turn into projects that progress through cycles of - Engagement, Inspiration, Leadership, Assessment, Measurement, Benchmarking, Design, Implementation, Evaluation, and Iteration. In pursuit of sustainability, no project is ever really done. Projects may enter these cycles at any point and may cycle through several iterations.

","Learning together, in a place that models sustainability, has many benefits. Our own facilities management team, which has successfully pursued aggressive energy conservation measures for years, genuinely enjoys working with and “teaching” students and recognizes that the next frontier in energy and emissions reductions will require behavior change (i.e., basic and applied research) by the campus community. Using a comprehensive energy reduction strategy over the past two decades, WMU has reduced its overall energy consumption while increasing its overall building area. Power plant emissions have been reduced by over 90%.

Ongoing reporting for numerous campus sustainability rating/ranking efforts reaffirms our belief that in order for these sustainability efforts to provide value they must be relevant to policies and practices on campus AND have engagement and support from administrators.  Without engagement and clear linkages to internal strategic planning processes, participation might be more of a distraction to sustainability champions, taking away precious time to implement potential sustainability initiatives already prioritized on campus.  Fortunately, we are seeing participation and internal commitments of financial support to move forward with sustainability efforts even in these times of shrinking budgets—because the value proposition of sustainability as improving quality of life for all is clearly being recognized on campus and beyond.

This past fall the University community delivered more than 25 major climate change programs in the community and we did a pro bono Bike Share Options study for Kalamazoo at the request of the mayor. We hosted a Community Sustainability Roundtable and Sustainability Slam on National Campus Sustainability Day 2013 and a regional Sustainability Leadership Summit in early 2014. These projects and many others are helping to advance WMU’s effort to build a culture of sustainability on campus and beyond.

The Fine Arts are an integral part of WMUs campus wide sustainability efforts. The Office for Sustainability has a dedicated art wall, which has housed student and faculty art shows.

It is thrilling to report other efforts increasing around campus. A juried art exhibit addressing climate change was arranged to run Oct. 10-17, 2013 in WMU's Richmond Center for Visual Arts. Western Michigan University students who wished to share their creative vision for climate change were invited to submit original artwork to the ""Spare|Change: The Art of Climate"" exhibit. All full- and part-time WMU students enrolled in the fall 2013 semester were eligible to submit up to three pieces of original artwork.

""Spare|Change: The Art of Climate"" was sponsored by the WMU Environmental Studies Gwen Frostic Series in partnership with the University's Frostic School of Art and Center for Humanities as well as the Kalamazoo Nature Center and People's Food Co-op.
