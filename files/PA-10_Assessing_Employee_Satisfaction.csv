The Chronicle of Higher Education’s “Great Colleges to Work For” Program: For the last seven years, Duke University has participated in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s “Great Colleges to Work For” program, a study designed to recognize institutions that have built great work environments.  Part of the program involves a survey distributed to a sample of each institution’s full-time faculty, administrators and professional staff.  The survey is administered by ModernThink, a consulting firm conducting the survey on behalf of The Chronicle of Higher Education, to ensure the confidentiality of responses. It assesses several categories, including job satisfaction/support, career development, research & scholarship, communication, supervisor relationship, and participation in college governance.  Duke has been recognized each of the seven years as one of the “Great Colleges to Work For,” including 2014. 

Duke University Health System’s Work Culture Survey: Duke University Health System offered its first Work Culture Survey in 1999 to determine how staff ranked the workplace in terms of communication, teamwork, and recognition. The results of the survey led to many new programs and enhancements. Today, the Work Culture Survey is conducted on an annual basis to assess the progress made since the previous survey and identify needs for strengthening the DUHS work culture.  Work culture committees have been developed to include a cross-section of employees and managers to identify and implement programs to improve the work environment. The survey has been an effective tool for monitoring and sustaining progress in improving the work environment and employee satisfaction at Duke University Health System.

Employees with faculty rank are assessed through the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) survey, which gathers faculty perspectives on institutional climate, sources of stress and satisfaction, student interaction and teaching methods. It is conducted every three years, with the most recent administration in 2014.   
The Staff Advisory Council (established in 2011) conducted a short survey, which was sent to 100% of employees who do not have faculty rank, to establish a more detailed assessment of the experiences of staff employees.  
The Office of Human Resources sends out an annual survey to all employees in regards to benefits and services rendered by the Office of Human Resources, such as health insurance and the wellness program. In addition, an Exit Questionnaire is provided to employees who are leaving the university. 
Various departments conduct surveys or ask for feedback to improve services. For example, the Office of Leadership and Professional Development conducts a needs assessment among staff and faculty to determine the services and training employees would like to assist with skill and knowledge development. ","Survey results are reviewed by the administering department. Recommendations are made and presented to Senior Staff for consideration. 
For the HERI survey, recommendations go from the Academic Affairs Advisory Committee to Senior Staff. 
Recommendations from Staff Advisory Council (SAC) assessments go to Senior Staff through the Chair of the SAC. 
The results of the SAC survey mentioned above led to the development of a Quality of Life Committee with representatives from across campus. The committee conducted research and focus groups and developed a Quality of Life Action Plan in 2013 with several recommendations (immediate, mid-term and long-term). Implementation of those recommendations continues. 
Results from HR’s annual survey are used to improve provided services. Exit Questionnaire feedback is collected, analyzed and used in various ways to help improve employees’ experiences, including employee relations issues. Recommendations are taken to Senior Staff by the Senior Vice President for Business, Finance and Technology. 
Based on feedback from employees and other considerations, the University instituted a three-phased salary plan in December 2013 to increase employee salaries. Also based on employee feedback, starting in January 2015, one day of vacation was added to the accrual periods for regular full-time employees who work 40 hours per week on a 12-month schedule. Regular employees who work 20-39 hours per week on a 12-month schedule generally accrue paid time off on the same basis as full-time employees, with the time pro-rated to the number of hours worked.

●	 You identify with the goal of authentic sustainability and GMC’s strategies for working toward that goal.
●	You are personally working to achieve authentic sustainability at GMC. 
●	You feel your personal path to success is affected by the goal of authentic sustainability at GMC.

●	The mission provides direction for the curriculum and other activities of the College.
●	The College's governance structure effectively facilitates achievement of its mission and purposes.

","Issues raised by the evaluation are addressed through two channels. 

First, the results are shared with the campus at large through a community conversation. For example, at the community conversation in the spring of 2014, the results of the survey were shared through an oral presentation and also through hard copies of the data that were passed out to attendees. Attendees were then asked to write their ideas for improvements on big sheets of paper with markers. These ideas were then transcribed into a typed list that was emailed to the whole campus so that leaders in various areas around campus could work to address the issues. The list of ideas was also given to the strategic plan steering committee, which used them to prioritize projects and programs to help advance the strategic plan. Employee engagement and satisfaction is deeply embedded in the strategic plan goals 1A: ""Initiate a cross-college emphasis on human health and quality of life that becomes a nationally recognized compliment to our environmental emphasis"" and 1C: ""Deepen student and employee engagement in the College's endeavors to promote innovation and retention.""

Random sampling surveying was done in 2013 and will be done in 2014 as part of the university’s application to workplace awards processes. Another university-wide employee survey is scheduled to be conducted in 2015; all results from that survey will be shared with the university’s highest levels of leadership and individual managers with five or more responses from their employees will receive a report and be expected to conduct action planning to identify actionable items that would improve employee satisfaction or engagement in their areas.

In 2013, however, the university participated in several workplace award processes that included a random sampling of employees for an online satisfaction survey. The awards were: Fortune 100 and the Chronicle of Higher Education. In both cases, results were shared with the President, Provost, and their direct reports. Because those surveys were a random sampling only, managers did not receive reports or conduct action planning. The results, though, have been used in strategic planning by the Vice President for Human Resources when identifying programs, services and institutional priorities for Stanford’s workforce.

For university-wide surveying, a vendor is hired to customize and administer the survey. Employee email addresses and organization hierarchy (needed for accurate reporting) is given to the vendor to load into their system. Broad communication is conducted from University Human Resources (UHR) to alert employees to the email they should have received that includes a link to the survey. The key point of contact for UHR is each school or unit’s HR manager, who supports the effort with local communication.

Planning is already underway for the 2015 university-wide employee survey, to ensure its success, and starts with a Request for Proposal to qualified vendors, with a Steering Committee evaluating proposals to select the most qualified vendor.

Once the survey period has closed, the vendor generates reports for managers with five or more responses, and for the leaders in each school/unit, and then an aggregate summary of results for university leaders. Debriefings are held with school/unit leaders as well as university leaders.  Then, the VP for Human Resources has a separate meeting with university leaders to discuss the results and identify actionable items.
","Depending on the nature of the issue that is raised, various leaders may be involved; for example, the Faculty Affairs office might be involved to address an issue raised by faculty who responded, where University Human Resources would be involved to address an issue for staff.

In the 2010 survey process, one of the lowest rated categories was Feedback and Coaching, which garnered a 53% satisfaction level. As a result of that finding, the President and Provost funded two large scale initiatives:

1.	An initiative to develop a comprehensive “Manager Academy” for all managers that would include training to develop skills in providing feedback and coaching for managers and their staff.

2.	A pilot program was initiated to form a cohesive performance management approach at Stanford. The goal is to simplify the process and provide tools and the business process that facilitates managers’ ability to give meaningful and constructive feedback to staff, as well as to coach them to develop further. In addition, tools for employees to support their communication with their managers are included. This pilot, called Performance Management @ Stanford, now includes close to 3,000 employees and is scheduled to be launched in the remaining schools and units within the next four years, culminating in adoption by all schools and units. 

For both of these university-wide initiatives, UHR was responsible to plan, develop, implement, and measure effectiveness after university leaders approved funding. Leaders will be looking at the next set of survey results to identify if improvements have been made in the area of feedback and coaching.

At the local level, managers who receive individual reports are responsible to have discussions with their staff to share the results, and to collectively brainstorm options to make improvements in areas that are weak, and to identify how to maintain or further excel in areas rated highly. Each school or unit is responsible to identify the mechanism by which managers are held accountable for their action planning; typically, this is included in their performance goals for the fiscal year in which the results are shared.

Within the university, the seven schools and 20 academic and administrative units have the discretion to administer local employee satisfaction and engagement surveys as they wish. For example, the Graduate School of Business designed such a survey over 10 years ago, and administers it without fail at the same time each year. The Residential & Dining Enterprises unit administered a survey in fall 2013 and is still working on action planning based on the results. Other schools and units may conduct their own survey processes at any time, with the results used by their Dean, Vice President, Vice Provost, and local managers.

She developed and utilizes the Transformational Tapestry model as a research design for campus climate studies. 

Faculty members, administrators and staff members are significantly impacted by campus climate. According to workplace studies, the personal and professional development of professionals is greatly enhanced through a healthy working environment. Research suggests that faculty members who consider their campus climate healthy and inclusive are more likely to feel personally and professionally supported. Research also indicates that there is a direct relationship between workplace discrimination and negative job and career attitudes. 

To assist in contextualizing the survey for UC and to capitalize on the many campus climate assessment efforts some campuses already have undertaken, a systemwide work team was formed in September 2011 which consisted of representatives from each of the campuses, UCOP, the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, plus organization appointees from the Academic Senate, Council of UC Staff Assemblies, UC Students Association, unions and others.

The systemwide work team was responsible for developing core survey questions that would be asked of all locations.  The team selected survey questions from the consultant's tested collection, and included questions that previously have been asked in campus-specific or population-specific surveys at UC.  By adding questions for which some data is already available, UC campuses will be able to conduct longitudinal analysis and obtain consistent data for all populations.

Campus representatives to the systemwide work team formed local work teams at each location with additional participants, who also provided feedback on survey questions. The local work teams were responsible for contextualizing the core survey questions and creating campus specific questions that were added to the survey.

In the summer of 2012, the UH Staff Council requested that a follow-up survey be administered in Fall 2012. Based on the results of the 2011 Survey and staff feedback, several changes were made to the 2012 survey. Because of staff concerns about the anonymity of their responses, no demographic information was collected in the 2012 survey. The survey length was also reduced by 42%. Finally, new items were added to the survey to gather more detailed information about two issues that staff identified as important in the 2011 Survey: communication quality and staff perceptions of fairness. However, the main goal of this survey, as in 2011, was to examine staff attitudes regarding their jobs and UH, identify aspects of the work environment that drive staff attitudes, and examine potential consequences of these attitudes. 

UH staff received an email invitation from Staff Council to participate in an online version of the survey over a two-week period in November through December 2012. Paper surveys in English and Spanish were also made available to staff with limited or no computer access. The survey contained 96 items and one open-ended item inviting staff to leave comments. Survey participants were asked to respond to a number of questions using a five-point likert scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). All scales are reliable and valid measures of their respective constructs. Of the 1,169 staff members who attempted the online survey, 932 (80%) completed the entire survey and 333 (35.7%) included comments at the end. The survey participants represent every division and college on the main campus, as well as positions ranging from technical service craft (e.g., electrician, groundskeeper) to executive (e.g., deans, associate vice presidents).
","Survey results indicate that staff are satisfied with their jobs in general (76%) and committed to UH (62%); thus we did not target those attitudes for further investigation. However, staff satisfaction with pay (16%) and promotions (20%), as well as perceptions of reward fairness (32%) were relatively low. A comparison of UH staff attitudes in 2011 and 2012 indicated few significant changes. However, although the 2011 survey indicated that staff in Technical & Service Craft jobs experienced more challenges to morale and poorer attitudes, the results of the 2012 survey indicate that the attitudes of those in Technical & Service Crafts jobs have increased to a level that is on par with attitudes of other staff at UH.

Together, these results suggest that the primary issue regarding staff morale is one of feeling under appreciated. The data resulted in at least four strategies for managers at all levels who desire to improve staff morale: 1) communicate important information that affects staff to them in a clear and timely manner; 2) be open and candid in all communications with staff, particularly with information that pertains to performance feedback, raises, and promotion opportunities; 3) communicate with staff regarding what role they play in helping UH solidify its status as a Tier 1 research university; 4) find informal ways to demonstrate appreciation for staff contributions. 

Moreover, there are several strategies supervisors can implement to improve morale: 1) performance expectations should be communicated to staff in clear, unambiguous terms; 2) procedures and standards for pay and promotion decisions should be explained thoroughly and in clear, unambiguous terms; and 3) provide staff with accurate performance feedback year-round so that they know where they stand.

UMass also conducted a Workplace Bullying Survey of all UMass employees in 2012 in order to assess the nature and extent of their overall work experiences and their familiarity with workplace bullying. This is the first stage of a campaign aimed at spreading awareness about workplace bullying and ultimately to increase safety, respect, and overall employee satisfaction.

UMass Amherst also partnered with a third-party program run through the Chronicle of Higher Education to evaluate employee satisfaction.  The ""Great Colleges To Work For Program"" is an annual survey designed to recognize institutions that have been successful in creating great workplaces and to further research and understanding of the factors, dynamics and influences that have the most impact on organizational culture at institutions of higher education. 

UMass Amherst is listed among the Chronicle of Higher Education’s “Great Colleges to Work For 2011” in the area of tenure clarity and process. The CHE says “The university tries to ‘demystify the tenure process’ for faculty, one administrator says. It notes that all junior faculty in their third year have pre-tenure reviews with the provost’s office and can attend workshops to learn more about the process.(Chronicle of Higher Education, 7/25/11)

At the core of the program is a two-part assessment process: a faculty/employee survey (The ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey©) and an institutional audit capturing information detailing various institution demographics, polices, practices and infrastructure (The ModernThink Institution Questionnaire©). 

The survey is anonymous, and is sent to a sample of administrators, faculty and staff.  Our Office of Institutional research receive high level summaries of the survey results. ",The campus followed up the workplace bullying survey by requiring a mandatory 90 minute training for all staff to take place in spring 2014 on the subject of workplace bullying and environmental awareness and the Chancellor's Office has established a Workplace Bullying Committee to respond to bullying in the workplace.

Press Ganey’s clientele is exclusively in health care, and they focus particularly on academic medical centers.  As such, they have the largest external benchmark available in the U.S. for hospitals for employee surveys.  The survey itself is jointly designed by Press Ganey and UMHS, building upon a core set of mandatory items from Press Ganey’s model, and enhanced with supplemental questions that come from Press Ganey’s item bank and a few questions of UMHS’s own design.  All rated survey questions use a 1-to-5 scale methodology. There are two open-ended questions, and a couple of non-standard supplemental questions that are descriptive in nature (i.e., categorical, but not based on a scale nor open-ended).  The survey is administered annually in late winter or early spring.  The survey is hosted through a third party application outside of UMHS (at press Ganey).  Access to the online survey is controlled through a user-known password that is required to enter the survey, and is matched against a list of qualified employees sent to Press Ganey beforehand.  A small number of departments whose employees do not have access to computers are supported with paper-based surveys, which Press Ganey receives and processes.

Budget and Finance: All employees of the Business & Finance Office are surveyed every other year for employee satisfaction.

"," University Health System: Issues raised by the survey can be addressed at several different levels depending on the nexus of control over the issue.  Most issues and concerns are local.

Bowen Loftin, the MU Staff Advisory Council decided to gather information from MU staff members to present a snapshot of staff issues and concerns in face of administrative change.  The Chancellor’s Diversity Office offered to facilitate a survey using questions prepared by the Staff Advisory Council.  The resulting online survey was sent to staff during the month of March, 2014.  The survey elicited valuable feedback about employee's feelings about the university and topics of concern to be improved upon.

The Staff Advisory Council at the University of Missouri-Columbia was formed by the Chancellor in October 1978. The mission of the Council includes advising the chancellor on matters of mutual interest, and provides an appropriate and effective channel for bringing staff members’ concerns and interests to campus administration. The Council acts as a liaison for staff and administration on matters which are initiated by staff, and also on those initiated by the Council. The Council attempts to heighten awareness of contributions made by staff members to the University of Missouri, and recognizes those contributions publicly. It also serves as an information source for staff members regarding policy changes which affect them. The Council does not function as a bargaining unit or a grievance committee. ","Comments were compiled based on topics within the answers for several questions.  While several comments discuss the same topic, many were included in the final report as a way to express the concerns of all staff to MU Administration. Please note that there were four comments which included specific names of MU employees.  Due to the nature of some of these comments, the Staff Advisory Council chose to redact the names mentioned from the copy of the survey results that will be available to the public.  The complete survey results, including individual names, were included in the version of the survey presented to Chancellor Loftin and Interim Vice Chancellor Ward.

The response to the 2013 survey resulted in over 3,000 submissions, a strong response rate of 28 percent from more than 11,000 faculty and staff. 

The 2013 campus-wide employee satisfaction survey asked most of the same questions as the 2010 survey so that changes could be tracked over time. The faculty job satisfaction survey (COACHE) was designed by Harvard University and has been used by UNC's peers and other campuses in the UNC System.  Both of the surveys were administered via the web with invitations and reminders sent via email.

The employee survey will be reviewed and suggested changes evaluated for potential implementation by the Carolina Counts program. The Chancellor initiated Carolina Counts to carry out key recommendations resulting from an efficiency and effectiveness assessment conducted in 2009. Recommendations focused on streamlining campus operations; implementing simpler, more responsive systems and processes; reducing bureaucracy; and creating a more satisfying work environment.

In general, campus views of the University’s vision, and the people and processes in place to fulfill it, were more positive in 2013 than in 2010. Three-fourths of employees believe that Carolina has both a compelling vision and the talent needed for future success. Moreover, 79 percent of employees would recommend Carolina as a place to work, and 66 percent believe it is a highly effective organization.

http://carolinacounts.unc.edu/","The results of the campus-wide employee survey were summarized and shared with employees through email announcements, with more detailed statistics made available on the University website.   The Chancellor, vice chancellors, and various groups on campus discussed the findings, which suggested that the University had made improvements in the areas of leadership, clarity of communications, decision-making, and staff development since the first administration of the survey in 2010. 

The Carolina Counts program encompasses the entire operational improvement initiative at UNC. The first phase of this initiative was the Diagnostic phase resulting in the consultant report that was presented to the university community. The current phase is Analysis and Design.

The analysis and design phase is comprised of 10 initiatives or improvement areas. Each improvement area is led by a champion.  There are projects underway to achieve the targets identified in each area. Each project team is comprised of a group of faculty, staff, or administrators as appropriate, and led by a project team leader.

Under the leadership of the project leader, the teams research opportunities, analyze processes or policy options and cost implications, evaluate alternative scenarios, define measurements, estimate potential savings, and propose a solutions. The champion approves the solution and assigns it to an implementation team to put the recommendation in action.

Each participating institution is asked to submit an email list of full-time faculty/staff randomly selected across four categories (Administration, Faculty, Exempt Professional Staff, and Non-exempt Staff) to participate in the survey. 

Sample sizes are determined based on the number of employees in the various categories. Four-year Schools: Up to 600 randomly selected employees among the four eligible job categories.

Faculty also participates in the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) Survey in spring, and this survey includes general workplace satisfaction questions. The HERI survey is on a 3-year cycle, but it includes only faculty.","Most recent March 2015 survey results are in the process of being evaluated. 
Issues raised and addressed from the 2008 campus survey and 2011 faculty survey include:
*Low morale was intricately linked to salaries below national averages:
In a study of faculty and staff salaries at UW-Stevens Point found many of our faculty and staff members are paid lower than comparable faculty and staff members (by rank and discipline/area) at public peer institutions nationwide. During the 2012-13 year the university set aside more than $200,000 of base funding to address salary inequities of faculty and academic staff.  Of this allocation, over $150,00 was distributed to faculty through an equity formula developed through governance and approved by the Faculty Senate that compares faculty to their National peers.  In addition, more than $65,000 went to addressing salary inequities for academic staff. The university continues to work with faculty and staff governance at refining these processes for distributing equity funds.
*Faculty and Staff cited that they needed to have additional academic support services to address incoming student populations with a greater range in academic preparedness:
Administration supported a substantial increase in support of academic services.  The number of students served across all programs in the Tutoring and Learning Center (TLC), and their contact hours, grew by 28% this past year.  Services included: expanded hours and satellite locations; hosted football study table; conducted in-class workshops; Math and Career Services Partnership, Advising, Disability Services,   residential living and learning communities; piloted a Supplemental Instruction Program©; and intensive credit based training programs for bath and science tutors. 
*Faculty and staff reported that there was not a consistent expectation for faculty to offer High Impact Learning Strategies within their department:
Administration retooled and just launched a streamlined General Education Program (GEP) in Fall 2013 embedding high impact practices such as an experiential learning component, a first year seminar, as well as a capstone project.   Experiential learning is the synthesis of a hands-on experience such as in internship, externship, research or community project. UW-Stevens Point expects all students will demonstrate skills, processes, and resources needed to make a successful transition from college to the world.
