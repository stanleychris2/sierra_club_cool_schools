",True," In 2010 and 2011 New Student Experiences were studied. The goal of the New Student Experience is help all students connect to Baylor, develop autonomy, succeed academically, engage in spiritual formation, develop personal and professional goals, and understand Baylor's mission and learning outcomes. Past reports on the New Student Experience indicated most students were meeting these outcomes, but we have yet to include all students in meeting the outcomes. The 2010 report demonstrated vulnerable populations, such as minority and students from low-socioeconomic status, may be disproportionately represented in the group of students who did not achieve the outcomes of the New Student Experience programs. To address this discrepancy, data from the 2011 cohort of entering students was analyzed in a similar manner to 2010 study with the express intent of revealing longitudinal patterns in the data.  Key findings: Many of the findings from the 2010 report were also apparent in the 2011 data, such as: participants in the New Student Experience survey and the National Survey of Student Engagement differ from non-participants on key variables like GPA and retention, vulnerable populations on campus struggle disproportionately, the findings from the first year experience at Baylor mirror the findings in the literature of several disciplines, including education, sociology, and psychology, and university students’ self-appraisal and the achievement measures collected by the university appear disconnected.   In addition, the university’s new strategic plan, Pro Futuris, calls for transformative experiences for all students.  Programmatic Recommendations; 1) Implement opportunities for student, staff, and faculty to enhance their cross-cultural competencies to help create a campus environment that is welcoming to all students. 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of the transfer living-learning center. 3) To enhance opportunities for student-faculty interactions, consider requiring all first-year students to take an academic first-year seminar that is limited to 20 students.  Further Research: 1) A comprehensive campus climate study to identify specific recommendations for addressing the apparent disparity in how identity intersects with student experiences at Baylor University. 2) A comprehensive study on the transfer student experience to identify the structures and programs in place that facilitate or impede success.  3) Examine additional cohorts using the same or similar methodology 4) Identify longitudinal patterns in student success by following a single cohort through graduation. ",True,"Regular reviews/informal assessments of employee data diversity has created an awareness and indicate the need to be intentional.  As a result, the university has formed committees and task forces to review and examine ways to proactively insure diversity.

Baylor University is committed to maintaining a diverse faculty and staff, creating a community of fairness and respect, ensuring that resources are accessible, advancing the university's affirmative action goals, and complying with related laws and guidelines.  Diversity at Baylor is an essential component of academic excellence. A range of information, consultation, and training is provided to the Baylor community on issues related to workforce diversity and inclusion. Baylor recognizes that having a diverse and inclusive community is an ongoing process, and we continually seek ways to create and maintain such an environment. As we enhance our goals of scholarship and service, we have committed to create an environment in which differences are both welcomed and appreciated.  Baylor offers a number of dynamic and interactive training seminars designed to promote general cultural awareness and management of a diverse workforce. Baylor University endeavors to provide equal opportunity for employment to all persons regardless of race, color, sex, national origin, disability, age, or veteran status.

Toward New Destinations is thus designed to promote the pursuit of excellence through support for the core values provided in Cornell’s institutional commitment of “Open Doors, Open Hearts, Open Minds.”

Toward New Destinations presents a comprehensive list of diversity goals structured according to four core principles: composition, engagement, inclusion, and achievement. These principles serve to display the scope of this new approach to planning, which includes the demographic make-up of the institution; Cornell’s ability to inspire personal, social, and professional commitment to its goals and activities on the part of all members of its community; the climate and nature of professional and interpersonal relations at the university; and the levels of attainment of underrepresented individuals or groups.  

Initiatives in the engagement and inclusion principles specifically focus on campus diversity culture, thus regularly reported progress and accomplishments on these initiatives provide unit-level culture information.

Under President Keohane's leadership Duke undertook to assess the place we have come to in gender equality with unusual courage and candor.

The comprehensiveness of the Women's Initiative report remains its most striking feature. Rather than studying a single segment of the university community, a team of task forces considered the full set of women's experiences within the university: the lives of women faculty, staff, graduate students, undergraduates, and alumnae as well. Through this breadth of focus, the report was able to highlight issues that link the experience of women across categories, such as the critical role of mentorship. At the same time, the study noted that the most salient issues for women in the university are often specific to their position, so that a women's agenda needs to have many different parts. The relation of the tenure clock to family responsibilities is an issue for untenured women faculty members, but not for the tenured. Childcare is an issue for younger faculty, staff and some graduate students but not, with rare exceptions, for undergraduates. And the pressures on undergraduate women have their own character, which the report is careful to detail.

",True,"Duke aims to increase underrepresented minority student science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) degree completion by 8 percent. To achieve this commitment, Duke will partner with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to create a Collaboratory On Mentoring, Persistence, Assessment, and Student Success (COMPASS).

The focus for COMPASS at Duke is to replace a one-size-fits-all approach with a suite of different teaching methods that were chosen based on evidence that they are effective in reaching different groups of students. Duke’s commitment to this goal will engage students and faculty, span multiple departments and create a community of STEM learners and research practitioners.

“We applaud the President and First Lady's initiatives to increase opportunities for all high school students to access higher education,” Baker said. “Duke has been and we will continue to focus on recruiting and supporting highly meritorious students from diverse backgrounds.” 
 
To date, Duke has launched several initiatives to reach underserved young students and improve their access to college. A partnership with the College Advising Corps has Duke students serving as college advisers to high school students in rural North Carolina communities. Duke also runs a pre-orientation program for first-generation students each fall to ease their transition into college.

In addition, Duke continues to have a need-blind admissions policy, which means that all qualified U.S. applicants are accepted regardless of their ability to pay for college. Duke guarantees it will meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need.

This was the first time that such an extensive survey had been administered at Eastern. A campus climate survey was developed by the Diversity Race and Justice (DRJ) Committee in the spring of 2008 and was administered in the spring and fall of 2008. The purpose of the survey was to provide baseline data about the perceptions of the university campus climate by different segments of our population.

The last survey was conducted in the spring of 2014 and the next will be completed in 2016. The survey asks participants to indicate the extent to which they agree with the following statements:
1) Green Mountain College demonstrates a strong commitment to incorporating diversity awareness into the curriculum.
2) Diverse perspectives are encouraged at GMC.
3) GMC’s goals of creating diverse learning and social communities are clear.
4) GMC demonstrates a commitment to social justice.

In 2014, a majority of the respondents answered ""somewhat agree"" or ""strongly agree"" to that set of statements. 

Participants are also asked to indicate how much respect they see for the following types of diversity within the GMC community and how much GMC is inclusive of each of these types:
1) Race
2) Gender
3) Sexual Identity
4) Religious Beliefs
5) Socioeconomic Status
6) Ethnicity
7) Physical or Developmental Ability
8) Political Views

In 2014, for the first question about how much diversity they see, a majority of the respondents answered ""moderate inclusion"" or ""high inclusion"" for all of the categories except for political views. A majority of the respondents answered ""little inclusion"" or ""moderate inclusion"" for political views. 

For the second question about the extent to which GMC is inclusive of diversity, a majority of respondents answered ""little"" or ""moderate"" for race, and ""moderate"" or ""high"" for gender. For religious, socio-economic status, and ethnicity, respondents tended toward the middle with a majority clustering around ""moderate."" For disabilities, the majority answered ""little"" or ""moderate."" For political views, the majority answered ""very little"" to ""moderate.""

The first step in using these results to shape policy, programs, or initiatives was to have a community-wide conversation in the spring of 2014. The results were shared at the conversation through a presentation and through handouts of the data. Participants then wrote ideas about how to improve on big sheets of paper that were collected and transcribed into typed lists. These lists were then emailed to the whole campus so that staff, faculty, and students can incorporate the results into their areas. The results were also discussed on the strategic plan steering committee and used to inform the next set of priorities the committee addresses.

1) The strategies used by GMC to create a diverse living and learning environment are effective.
2) My experiences at GMC have helped me develop an appreciation for multicultural perspectives.
3) There is a strong sense of respect for diversity across the GMC community.
4) I think that people at GMC with perspectives, religious traditions, and cultural activities different than my own are able to express themselves freely and feel included.
5) My experiences at GMC have allowed me to feel comfortable expressing my creativity.
6) I feel comfortable participating in my cultural/religious traditions at GMC.
7) I think that the diversity I bring to the College is appreciated.

In 2014, the majority of respondents answered ""somewhat agree"" or ""strongly agree"" for the following statements: ""there is a strong sense of respect for diversity across the GMC community""; ""people at GMC with perspectives, religious traditions, and cultural activities different than my own are able to express themselves freely and feel included,"" and ""my experiences at GMC have allowed me to feel comfortable expressing my creativity.""

The majority of respondents tended toward the middle or ""neutral"" with the statements ""I feel comfortable participating in my cultural/religious traditions at GMC"" and ""I think that the diversity I bring to the College is appreciated.""

Finally, participants are asked, in an open-ended question, if they are aware of any particular groups that struggle to be included at GMC. The n for this question was low, but nonetheless some trends emerged, indicating struggles for a small number of people across the areas of race, nationality, religion, and political philosophy.

2) I have felt that my perspectives have been included in the decision making processes at GMC when I wanted them to be.
3) I have been actively trying to participate in the decision making processes at GMC.

In 2014, a majority of respondents answered ""neutral"" or ""somewhat agree"" to all three of the statements. 

Respondents are also asked how much they think each of the following groups are taken into account when decisions are made at GMC?

1) Board of Trustees
2) Administration
3) Faculty
4) Staff
5) Students
6) Members of the general Poultney Community

2014 results showed that most people thought The Board was considered most highly when decisions are made, followed by the Administration, and then faculty. Staff and students both tended toward ""somewhat included."" The Poultney community clustered between ""very minimally included"" and ""somewhat included."" 

As with the other data, results for these questions were shared with the community at large during an open community conversation.

Goals must be met with university and department wide objectives and metrics. 

The plan was adopted in 2013 with departments setting goals; the first annual reports on progress and assessment were 2014-2015.  

The university metric is  75% of Miami students will report that they feel welcome and have had significant and meaningful interactions with diverse groups.

Not only is it necessary to enhance diversity at Miami University, it is also essential to create an environment where it feels comfortable to work with people of various backgrounds, lifestyles, and beliefs.  To that end, it is important to create mechanisms to promote diversity, while at the same time ensuring that perceptions reflect the patterns that emerge.

Strategies in process to meet the goal:
Share the expertise of faculty and staff who are experienced in working with multicultural students (e.g., Office of Equity and Equal Opportunity staff) with other faculty and staff to help them adapt to the growing international and diverse domestic population.
Provide opportunities for students, faculty, and staff to have meaningful interactions with invited speakers from diverse backgrounds (e.g., receptions, class meetings, Q & A sessions).
Expand partnerships and support programs for students from diverse backgrounds (e.g., ACE and Eastern Shawnee Tribe).
Encourage broad participation, especially by faculty and students in multicultural events, with particular emphasis on promoting meaningful interactions among international and domestic students.
Coordinate activities across the University so that these events do not conflict.
Incorporate the work of women scholars and scholars of color into the curriculum.
Offer “Safe Zone” training, and establish new safe zones throughout the division.

The objective of compiling these testimonios is to establish a written record of the nature of the campus climate for Pitzer students on the Pitzer campus and at the Claremont Colleges.  We are interested in developing a sense of the range of experiences that students and faculty have experienced, both positive and negative.  Negative events ranged from those that are illegal (hate crime, sexual harassment, date rape, etc.) and physically threatening or explicitly hurtful (racist, sexist, homophobic, or religious slurs and intimidation, etc.) to more subtle experiences that occur on an everyday basis.  Positive events ranged from deep experiences of belonging and solidarity to simple feelings of being at home to having successful educational experiences in classrooms.  The report centers on the perspectives of students and faculty from groups that have historically been underrepresented and marginalized in U.S. society to explore how they experience the campus climate.

This report offers Pitzer College a chance to hear from members of non-dominant groups at the college about their experiences on campus.  We encourage the college community to listen respectfully to their experiences, both positive and negative, for how they can help us better understand what life at Pitzer is like for group members different from our own.  A lack of understanding can at times lead to interactions that are insulting, offensive, intimidating, inadvertently hurtful, and even threatening to students who see their experiences differently than do members of other groups. Hearing from the experiences in this report may help us deepen our commitment and strengthen our analysis of how to improve the conditions at Pitzer for all community members.  

The focus of the report is on the overall campus climate that these students have found during their years of study at Pitzer, rather than on any individual particular encounter. Through informed dialogue and systematic proactive responses, Pitzer may find ways to build trust and sustain positive working relationships across differences in ways that the present climate does not allow.  Our hope is that the report will deepen our understanding of what life at Pitzer is like for these students and faculty.   We hope that the report will help us work to bring our campus climate more closely in alignment with our stated mission and goals as an educational institution.

Purdue University,2016-02-26,2016-02-26 16:45:13,mgulich@purdue.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Purdue University participated in two national surveys and one institutional survey to assess the campus climate for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty members. 

To assess the campus climate for undergraduate students, Purdue students participated in the 2014 Student Experience in the Research University (SURE). Based at the University of California Berkeley, the SERU survey collects data on the undergraduate student experience at leading research universities across the United States. Questions relate to students’ attitudes, perceptions, and experiences inside and outside of the classroom. More information about this national survey may be found here: http://www.cshe.berkeley.edu/SERU. 

To assess the campus climate for graduate students, Purdue Graduate School annually administers an ‘in-house’ exit survey to all graduate students who graduate from the institution. This survey asks graduates questions about their experiences with the coursework they completed, perceptions about how they were treated by faculty, perceptions of the overall climate of their program, attitudes about their dissertation advisors role.

To assess the campus climate for faculty, Purdue faculty members participated in the 2015 Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE). This survey, based at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, involves more 15,000 tenure-track faculty members at over 200 colleges and universities across the United States. The survey asks questions that relate to career satisfaction to inform how institutions may improve faculty recruitment and retention. Purdue added additional questions to further assess the climate on campus
to understand whether there are differences across race/ethnicity and gender related to preferential treatment in the areas of recruitment and promotions, experiences with receiving helpful career advice from colleagues, inclusion in meetings, and perceptions about condescending attitudes toward specific groups. More information about the COACHE survey may be found here: http://coache.gse.harvard.edu/. 

Data across all surveys were dis-aggregated by race/ethnicity and gender to uncover differences in the perception of the campus climate. Data from these surveys are currently being utilized to inform metrics embedded in university-wide and unit-level diversity strategic plans. ",True,"Although everyone is encouraged to analyze and take action on data related to diversity and equity, the Diversity Leadership Team and the Provost’s Advisory Committee on Diversity in the Office of the Provost are involved with analyzing institutional data on student diversity and equity by program and educational level. 
In 2013-14, Purdue engaged in the Equity Scorecard Process. This project organizes institutional agents into teams and guides institutional stakeholders through a systematic process to analyze their own institutional data in ways that inform institutional change. More information about the Equity Scorecard may be found here: https://cue.usc.edu/tools/the-equity-scorecard/. 
Overtime and currently, Purdue utilized data from several institutional sources to make comparisons related to graduation and retention across race/ethnicity and gender. Our primary data sources include the Purdue Data Digest (https://www.purdue.edu/datadigest/), Office of Enrollment Management (http://www.purdue.edu/enrollmentmanagement/researchanddata/reports.html), the Purdue University Graduate School (http://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/about/data-request.html), Office of Diversity and Inclusion Report Hate and Bias website (https://publicdocs.maxient.com/reportingform.php?PurdueUniv&layout_id=14), Office of Ethics and Compliance Climate Survey on Sexual Assault (http://www.purdue.edu/titleix/Climate_Survey/PurdueReport.pdf), and an internal data system called Cognos. In addition to our institutional data systems, Purdue also relies on the U.S. Department of Education’s IPEDS Data Center (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/), an external source, to make comparisons among our peer institutions. Collectively, these data sources enable us to analyze data across programs and educational levels related to graduation and retention across race/ethnicity and gender.
",True,"Similar to the analysis of student diversity and equity data, Purdue utilizes several data sources to assess progress related to faculty, managerial, and staff hiring across the university. These data sources include the Purdue Data Digest (https://www.purdue.edu/datadigest/), Affirmative Action Plans (http://www.purdue.edu/ethics/Affirmative_Action/Affirmative_Action.html), and IPEDS Data Center (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/). Information about the Purdue Data Digest and IPEDS Data Center is noted in the student diversity and equity response. These sources enable us to assess faculty composition and retention. Additionally, the Affirmative Action plans assess progress related to race/ethnicity, gender, veterans, and individuals with disabilities. All of these data provide Purdue with information by job level and classification to make comparisons across multiple identities, position types, and levels.

",True,"In 2015-2016, Purdue elevated its commitment to diversity and equity by appointing the Provost as the Chief Diversity Officer. Through this supplemental appointment, the Provost now assumes primary responsibility for outcomes associated with diversity and equity. Since the Provost’s appointment, he appointed a Diversity Leadership Team comprised of three senior faculty members and administrators (http://www.purdue.edu/diversity-inclusion/about-us/index.html). Furthermore, the Provost appointed an Advisory Committee on Diversity http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/purduetoday/releases/2015/Q3/provost-names-members-of-advisory-committee-on-diversity.html) comprised of 30 faculty, staff, and students. Annually, the Deans will be reporting on diversity metrics to the provost. Therefore, there will be structurally accountability. 
Moreover, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion includes several diversity-related sub-units designed to advance recruitment, retention, and inclusion at Purdue (http://www.purdue.edu/diversity-inclusion/about-us/departments.html). 

There are also diversity and equity committees within governance structures such as the Academic Senate, Purdue Graduate Student Government, and Purdue Student Government. These structures help ensure diversity and equity to remain at the forefront of institutional governance.

Structurally, Purdue has several coordinating bodies that are in place to focus on the needs of underrepresented groups. These groups are situated across the university and within colleges and include but not limited to: the Black Caucus of Faculty and Staff; Purdue University Latino Faculty and Staff Association; Women in Engineering Program; Minority Engineering Program; Center for Research on Diversity and Inclusion; Susan Bulkeley Center for Leadership Excellence (focused on women in leadership); Business Opportunity Program; Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Related Sciences; and Purdue Bound (a pre-college initiative focus on public engagement).

Purdue also has dozens of student organizations that focus explicitly on diversity and equity. Naturally, all of these organizations directly or indirectly influence the goals, objectives, and outcomes of the university.

2. Determine graduate enrollment and time to completion rates by ethnicity 
Current status: This project is ongoing.  Since graduate students don’t generally graduate by cohort, and their paths to graduation are less linear than those of undergraduates, determining time-to-degree is a work-in-progress.  

3. Gather and summarize what Rice currently captures about campus climate in student and parent surveys; and/or make a plan to introduce questions into 2012-13 surveys to measure attitudes and climate.

In the past several years we have conducted two Campus Climate surveys, each designed to extend the University community's shared understanding of our strengths and challenges in ensuring transparency and full participation in governance. For example, our formal governance structure ensures that representatives of the University's staff, faculty, and students serve on our highest-level policy committee, the President's Coordinating Council. Assessment results have indicated that more representation of those constituencies -- on our Board of Trustees, on ad hoc committees -- is desired, and our new President has embraced these calls by expanding involvement, including on strategic planning committees. 
 
Diversity amongst the faculty and staff garners regular attention and focused initiatives. In the past several years, institution-wide compensation studies for faculty and staff have focused on identifying and offering solutions to any existing inequities in compensation between genders, and across racial/ethnic constituencies. SLU is also stepping up efforts to recruit traditionally underrepresented faculty and staff, as we seek to develop an employee base that models diversity for a diverse student population.

The task force, appointed in September 2013, was charged with assessing the current state of equity and inclusion on campus and recommending further steps for the university to move forward with enhancing our core value of diversity.
In order to better understand the campus climate, the task force and university leaders recognized the need for a comprehensive tool that would provide campus climate metrics for students, faculty, and staff. To that end, the university appointed the Climate Study Working Group (CSWG) in 2014. The CSWG was comprised of faculty, staff, students, and administrators. Ultimately, Seattle University contracted with Rankin & Associates Consulting (R&A) to conduct a campus-wide study entitled, “Seattle University Assessment for Learning, Living, and Working.” Data gathering focused on the experiences and perceptions of various constituent groups. Based on the findings, the Task Force on Diversity and Inclusive Excellence will develop recommendations to share with the university community.

In September 2015, the University published the results of the 2015 academic year's Campus Climate Report. Seattle University community members completed 2,634 surveys for an overall response rate of 29%. Only surveys that were at least 50% completed were included in the final data set for analyses. Response rates by constituent group varied: 24% (n = 1,081) for Undergraduate Students, 18% (n = 362) for Graduate Students, 36% (n = 285) for Law Students, 49% (n = 566) for Staff/Administrators, and 46% (n = 340) for Faculty. 

Areas of strength identified by the assessment are: high levels of comfort with the climate at Seattle University; Positive attitudes about workplace climate (by employees); Positive attitudes about faculty work (by faculty respondents); Positive attitudes about academic experiences (by students); Intent to Persist (by students respondents).

But certain areas of improvement were also identified. As a response, in the January 2016 Final Report, The Task Force for Diversity and Inclusive Excellence identified six goals, each supported by several initiatives, that will propel the university’s commitment to equity, access, and community.
1. Realize an organizational infrastructure that embeds inclusive excellence in all aspects of the Seattle University experience

The climate assessment was done in 2014 via a survey  assessing the experiences of men and women of all ranks and disciplines including tenured, tenure-track (TT), and full time non-tenure track (NTT) faculty at Stevens. The survey was designed based on similar efforts that have been conducted at other major universities such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford, University of Michigan, and Rice and was adapted based on discussions with a diverse group of Stevens faculty and the ADVANCE leadership team to appropriately capture the unique experiences of faculty at Stevens. The survey was distributed and results analyzed by external evaluators Dr. Kristen Jones and Dr. Eden King.1)	Significant results of the Climate Survey show: 1) there is tension between T/TT and NTT faculty; 2) women faculty are less satisfied than men faculty in the work place; 3) the quality of faculty mentoring needs to be improved for all faculty; 4) service expectations and assignments vary by gender; 5) department climate perceptions vary by gender; 6) work-family integration varies by gender; and 7) the perception that taking leave hinders advancement varies by gender.2)	Based on the outcomes of the Climate Survey, ADVANCE Stevens will focus on the following key areas that map to the two major goals.

Summary of Graduate Student Campus Climate Survey - Spring 2012
 1) What can we do to change the experiences of graduate students from different demographic groups to foster a good climate for all graduate students? Graduate student groups such as Blacks, Hispanics, doctoral, and self‐reported historically underrepresented students generally report less satisfaction with the campus climate based on their overall impression of campus climate, their academic experience at Texas A&M, and perceptions related to faculty, staff, graduate and undergraduate students; at the university level, in the department, and in the research space/lab/group.
2) How can the University help graduate students see the value of diversity while promoting a more visible institutional commitment to diversity? While some graduate students perceive a lack of commitment to diversity, other graduate students question the need for promoting diversity altogether.
3) What can the University do to help graduate students engage in respectful interactions?
Tensions and cliques are prevalent on campus relating to: University traditions; undergraduate and graduate students; race/nationality and political and religious beliefs.
4) How can we address quality of life concerns?

The Office of Enrollment Services provides data each semester on the diversity of our students, including data on enrollment, retention and graduation rates by gender and ethnicity.  Over the years, data on retention and graduation rates for minority students have prompted new programming to better support students at a higher risk of not completing college.

University at Buffalo,2016-01-19,2016-01-19 10:15:49,jlk47@buffalo.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The University’s Office of Institutional Analysis currently (as of 2015) conducts regular surveys on campus climate issues such as the Student Opinion Survey (a satisfaction instrument), National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), and Senior Exit Survey and provides comparisons by gender and race/ethnicity for regular review by Academic Affairs and Enrollment Management leadership.  The surveys suggest that underrepresented minorities are as engaged in campus culture and programming as non-minorities and that the perception of campus diversity and equity has increased significantly in recent years, though some disconnect remains in perceptions of equity between minority and non-minority students.   

Perceived opportunity deficits are being addressed through several new learning communities and equal opportunity programs that address individual risks, financial needs, and educational aspirations.  In addition, the University has implemented for all students a new General Education curriculum that prioritizes American Pluralism coursework, domestic and global diversity components, and an integrative component that typically touches on diversity issues.  It is hoped that this curriculum will further bolster what is perceived as a strong climate of diversity.

The University also administers an entering student survey tailored to our large international student population and identified concerns among these students about communicating in English and adjusting to American educational and social customs.  The Office of International Student Services has responded by establishing a mentorship program that pairs each new international student with local faculty and staff to help negotiate the new institutional and cultural landscape and direct mentees to appropriate resources.
",True,"The University  currently (as of 2015) captures student diversity trends through standard enrollment reporting, exchange of enrollment data with other American Association of Universities (AAU) research institutions, and IPEDS comparisons against other New York State institutions.   These trends shows that the University has been among the top institutions nationally in enrolling international students for over 10 years.  Our proportion of underrepresented minorities is  large relative to other New York institutions and comparable to that of other AAU publics and both the NSSE and Senior Exit Survey have suggested increasing meaningful student engagement with diverse others.  The percentage among new freshmen has not grown in recent years, though, and in the interest in growing diversity the Offices of Enrollment Management and Admissions have reprioritized recruitment of qualified minority applicants.   By querying the National Student Clearinghouse database, we are able to review alternate destinations for underrepresented minorities who enroll elsewhere and revise recruitment strategies accordingly.

Annual retention reports and analyses indicate somewhat lower retention and graduation rates for underrepresented minorities and economically or educationally disadvantaged students.   These figures are provided in support of continued funding for learning communities and equal opportunity programs.  We also support these funding efforts with data from our standard climate surveys that identify specific challenges for economically or educationally disadvantaged students – particularly competing demands such as a need to work substantial hours off campus and household duties.   These issues are now addressed by the new Student Success Advisory Committee and subcommittee evaluations of programming aimed at the specific concerns of students in various stages of their undergraduate careers, of international students, and of students deemed at risk based on demographic or background factors.
",True,"The University’s exchange of employee diversity data with AAU peers (current as of 2015) shows that we are similar to these peers in the representation of women on faculty but low in the proportion of underrepresented minority faculty.  Under the auspices of the newly hired Vice Provost for Equity and Inclusion, recruitment of qualified minority faculty has been made a priority.  Federal IPEDS data show greater equity numbers wise on the staff side, but female and minority representation differs by appointment type.  The Professional Staff Senate’s Diversity Committee provides a forum to negotiate concerns of staff equity, and the Minority Faculty/Staff Association reports annually to leadership on the needs of its membership.

The University administered the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) survey in 2012 to tenure track faculty to assess satisfaction with their work, with campus culture and climate, and with tenure practices.  Its top-quartile rank on several work/home balance items and improving ratings on stop-the-clock policies  suggest recent attention to the specific needs of female tenure track faculty, though men were more likely than women to be satisfied with tenure policies and research resources.  White and minority faculty did not differ on key climate indicators.  However, faculty rated“fit” low relative to peers at other institutions.  In response, the Provost’s office endorsed an in-depth study of gender and racial/ethnic equity that focused on progress to tenure.  The Office of Faculty Affairs and Deans in the academic units are tracking differential progress to tenure by gender and race/ethnicity, and Faculty Affairs has also established a faculty exit survey to evaluate whether climate contributes to faculty leaving.

In addition, the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion currently (as of 2015) conducts an annual study of salary equity among female and minority faculty and staff for purposes of federal compliance.  None of these studies have indicated systemic salary inequities after accounting for discrepancies based on position, time in position, FTE, and discipline (for faculty).
",True,"The Vice Provost for Equity and Inclusion has begun to track diversity data on the representation of women and minorities among University leadership, including those in Dean’s offices in the academic units, on an annual basis (ongoing).  In addition, the salary equity studies conducted by Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion extend to senior leadership.  Within that category of employee, no systematic salary inequities have been found when controlling for position, time in position, FTE, and educational attainment.

The Community Engagement Task Force established by the Provost (ongoing) has taken a more qualitative approach to assessing whether community-based initiatives address issues of diversity within the community.  The Task Force has identified programs that provide insight into poverty and homelessness as well as training opportunities in literacy, leadership, and STEM disciplines.  It is developing recommendations on areas not adequately addressed by existing programs.  Meanwhile, the University’s Equal Opportunity Center continues to provide similar training opportunities and a bridge to higher education for those in the community that have been identified as educationally or economically disadvantaged according to federal guidelines.

UBC students continue to report improved satisfaction with their educational experience, according to the North American survey that gauges how well students engage with their university. The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) is a comprehensive study that measures five key benchmarks across first year and fourth year student populations. UBC showed improvements from 2006 to 2008 and once again, in the 2011 survey as compared to the 2008 survey. The latest results are encouraging and reflect an institutional strategy to improve levels of student engagement and increase student participation in enhanced educational experiences. NSSE surveys students in these five broad categories: Academic Challenge; Active and Collaborative Learning; Student-faculty Interactions; Enriching Educational Experiences; and Supportive Campus Environment.",True,"EMPLOYMENT EQUITY CENSUS
http://equity.ubc.ca/employment-equity/
The Equity Office manages the UBC's Employment Equity census which asks all staff and faculty to self-report on a number of diversity grounds, including the four designated groups as set out in the Employment Equity Act (women, visible minorities, persons with disabilities and Aboriginal persons). In 2009, additional questions were added in a supplemental questionnaire to include other areas of diversity such as sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, as well as more detailed questions about race, ethnicity, and disability. The 2013 Employment Equity Report is available at: http://equity2.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2010/06/Equity-Report-2013-FINAL.pdf.
The Employment Equity census data, as well as other equity-related assessments inform the direction of the work of the Equity and Inclusion Office and help establish priorities both for this office and the broader university. 

2014 WORKPLACE EXPERIENCES SURVEY
http://focusonpeople.ubc.ca/workplace-experiences-survey/
Questions about equity and diversity were incorporated into the 2014 Workplace Experiences Survey conducted by Human Resources and IPSOS Reid. This university-wide survey received responses from more than 5,002 faculty and staff (31% of total staff/faculty). The survey asked respondents to assess whether they felt that they had been treated unfairly in the workforce for reasons of ethnic or cultural origin, gender, religion, race, disability and/or sexual orientation. Family responsibilities were also addressed. The survey found that creating an inclusive work environment needs to be elevated to a higher priority, with defined measurements and a clear commitment. 

ADDITIONAL SURVEYS CONDUCTED
In addition, UBC utilizes assessment tools such as the National Survey of Student Engagement, the Beginning Student Survey of Engagement, the National College of Health Association Survey, the New to UBC Survey and others to understand the experiences of our students and to gather demographic information regarding our student population. 

FACULTY PAY EQUITY
In 2007 and 2009, the Equity and Inclusion Office (then known as the Equity Office) coordinated two studies that identified the systemic equity issue of a ‘”statistically significant” salary gap between male and female faculty in full-time tenured and tenure track appointments across all ranks. In keeping with UBC’s commitment to equity and the requirement to act in compliance with the B.C. Human Rights Code, the University partnered with the Faculty Association in 2010 to sponsor two working groups – The SMART Working Group and DATA Working Group. In 2012, the reports of the Working Groups were referred to a Gender Pay Equity Recommendations Committee for each campus. Both committees endorsed the working group’s recommendations to establish best practices and proactive monitoring as well as the imperative to address the pay gap as an issue across the UBC system.

STATUS OF WOMEN COMMITTEE
http://www.facultyassociation.ubc.ca/committees.php
The Faculty Association’s Status of Women Committee is responsible for mentoring/ networking, policy development, and advocacy on gender equity issues, including pay equity, discrimination (particularly in recruitment, retention, and promotion), working climate, and work-life balance.
",True,"UBC PRESIDENT’S TASK FORCE ON GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND ABORIGINAL STEREOTYPES
The Task Force on Intersectional Gender-Based Violence and Aboriginal Stereotypes was struck by President Toope in October 2013 in response to chants promoting rape culture and Aboriginal stereotypes that occurred during student-led events in September 2013. The report was published in March 2014 and is available online at http://equity2.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/05/Task-Force-on-IGBVAS-Final-Report-March-28-2014.pdf. 

The University published a response to the task force recommendations in May 2014 called Renewing our Commitment to Equity and Diversity, which is available online at: http://equity.ubc.ca/files/2014/05/RENEWING-OUR-COMMITMENT-TO-EQUITY-AND-DIVERSITY-FINAL-02.pdf. The response, within the broader context of equity work at UBC, was put forward as an action plan with four pillars: policy, strategic leadership and planning, curriculum and education, and supporting a respectful community. The action plan identifies the context of UBC’s current work in each of these areas, the approach being taken and key actions and accountabilities in each area.

IMPLEMENTING INCLUSION: A CONSULTATION ON ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE TO SUPPORT UBC’S COMMITMENTS TO EQUITY AND DIVERSITY REPORT
The 2013 the Implementing Inclusion Report (http://equity.ubc.ca/files/2010/06/Implementing-Inclusion-Equity-Diversity-Consultation-Report-April-2013.pdf) and subsequent responses (http://equity.ubc.ca/about/phase-2-response-implementing-inclusion-report/) outlined that a new model of governance and heightened equity and inclusion at UBC will establish stronger champions and accountability at the executive level, providing for greater coordination and integration of the wide range of current activities, and focus more resources in education and prevention. By adopting this report, the University embraced a framework that values equity, diversity and inclusion. 

In summer 2013 further public consultations were conducted across the UBC Okanagan and Vancouver campuses leading to the renaming of the Equity and Inclusion Office (formerly known as the Equity Office) in September 2013. 

In March 2014, the new Associate Vice-President Equity and Inclusion (http://equity.ubc.ca/avp-message/) began work at UBC and will continue to implement measures including education and communication, proactive initiatives and compliance and data collection to support and enhance the understanding and commitment to equity and mutual respect as central tenets for a thriving academic life at UBC.

The University has a long history of supporting initiatives that foster an inclusive living, learning, and working environment. A common recommendation offered by these initiatives was the need for a comprehensive tool that would provide campus climate metrics for students, faculty, staff, post-doctoral scholars, and trainees across the system. 
 
To that end, the University contracted with Rankin & Associates, Consulting (R&A) to conduct a system-wide “Campus Climate” survey. The purpose of the survey was to gather a wide variety of data related to institutional climate, inclusion, and work-life issues so that the University is better informed about the living and working environments for students, faculty, staff, post-doctoral scholars, and trainees at the ten UC campuses as well as the Office of the President, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Based on the findings, each UC campus and the three locations will develop action plans and strategic initiatives to improve the overall campus climate. 

UC Davis offered the survey in English and Spanish from January 31, 2013 through March 15, 2013 through a secure on-line portal. 77% of all respondents of all respondents were “comfortable” or “very comfortable” with the climate for diversity in their department/work unit/academic unit/college/school/clinical setting while 10% were “uncomfortable” or “very uncomfortable.” About four-fifths of the respondents thought UC Davis demonstrated that it values a diverse faculty and staff. ",True,"The Campus Climate Survey included questions about student diversity and educational equity. 

In addition, for the last ten years and most recently in 2014, UC Davis has participated in the University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES), a UC-wide census of all undergraduates at the nine general campuses. The survey includes a number of items that addressed dimensions of diversity and cultural compentency. Students are asked to rate their level of understanding of issues related to personal or cultural differences, for example their ability to work with people from other cultures and their comfort working with people from other cultures, both when they started at the campus and currently (at the time of the survey). 

The survey includes questions about how diversity has impacted their student development. For example, students are asked ""How often have you gained a deeper understanding of other perspectives through conversations with fellow students because they differed from you in the following ways,"" including ""Their sexual orientation was different,"" ""They were an immigrant or from an immigrant family,"" and ""They were from a different social class."" Students are also asked to rate how often they have heard faculty, instructors, staff, and administrators expressing negative or stereotypical views about races, genders, sexual orientations, social classes, religions, political affiliations, immigrant backgrounds, physical or other observable disabilities, and learning, psychological or other disabilities that are not readily apparent.",True,"The Campus Climate Survey included questions focused on employee diversity and employment equity, for example questions about hiring practices and efforts to diversity the recruiting pool.",True,"Academic Affairs administered the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) Survey in the fall of 2012 to evaluate the campus climate, work-life balance, and other potential barriers to diversity among STEM faculty at UC Davis.

",True,"Chancellor Blumenthal's Commitment to Diversity: 

At UC Santa Cruz, diversity is an integral part of our mission to teach, discover, and serve.

Diversity enriches everyone by ensuring that students, staff, and faculty engage with people who bring different sets of experiences, values, and views to the classroom, the laboratory, the art studio, and the dining hall. UCSC serves as an important testing ground—a place where personal experience trumps stereotypes and where diversity accelerates our pursuit of excellence.

Diversity and inclusion help bring UCSC’s Principles of Community to life by contributing to an open, purposeful, caring, just, disciplined, and celebrative campus climate. Our programs support the identities and aspirations of every student, staff member, and academic employee. Our goal is to build a community where each person enjoys a sense of belonging, where each person can be heard.

As chancellor, I am committed to furthering the cultural and social diversity of our campus community and to cultivating an inclusive campus climate. But diversity at UCSC is not a top-down initiative. Rather, it is interwoven into the fabric of the campus, a responsibility shared by all for the benefit of the entire community.

As a public university, UCSC is obligated to reflect the full range of people and cultures that make up the state of California. But it's not just duty or obligation that fuels our commitment. We are motivated by a desire to make society more equitable and to enhance opportunities for all.

In higher education, we are developing the leaders of tomorrow, people who will be active in all sectors of society and the world. With my full support, UCSC will continue building a diverse community and fostering a climate of inclusion in which all will thrive.

Chancellor's Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture and Inclusion: 

At the March 2010 Regents' meeting, President Yudof pledged to take steps to directly address campus climate issues that leave students feeling marginalized; to promote the identification and sharing of best practices that promote diversity and tolerance; to monitor progress on the campuses; and to provide effective oversight.

The President appointed a systemwide Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture and Inclusion and asked each campus Chancellor to chair and appoint a multi-constituency Council to advise the Chancellor and, as appropriate, the campus community.

Chancellor Blumenthal has appointed a campus Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture and Inclusion that includes faculty, staff, students, community members and alumni.

The charge of the UCSC Council is to:

Monitor and evaluate the progress of UCSC in creating conditions of climate, culture and inclusion that will best support the mission of the University and provide equal opportunities to all UCSC students, faculty and staff.

Identify, evaluate and share “promising practices” in efforts to create a welcoming and inclusive campus climate—looking broadly at other institutions, both public and private, inside and outside higher education, across the state and the nation.


UCSC Principle of Community:

The University of California, Santa Cruz is committed to promoting and protecting an environment that values and supports every person in an atmosphere of civility, honesty, cooperation, professionalism and fairness.

UCSC expects that every campus member will practice these Principles of Community.

Just: We are committed to due process, respect for individual dignity and equitable access to resources, recognition and rewards.
Disciplined: We seek to advance common goals through reasonable and realistic practices, procedures and expectations.
Celebrative: We celebrate the heritage, achievements and diversity of the community and the uniqueness and contributions of our members.
We accept the responsibility to pursue these principles in an atmosphere of personal and intellectual freedom, security, respect, civility and mutual support.

UCSC is committed to enforcement of policies that promote the fulfillment of our principles of community. These policies include but are not limited to: University of California Personnel Policies for Staff Members; applicable University Collective Bargaining Agreements; Academic Personnel Manual O15-University of California Policy on Faculty Conduct and the Administration of Discipline; UCSC Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline; UCSC Policy on Sexual Assault and UC Policy on Sexual Harassment; UCSC Hate Bias Incident Policy.

The Vice Provost for Diversity and International Affairs, in collaboration with the chairs of the commissions, recommends interventions and advises the administration regarding changes to better serve the needs of students, faculty and staff.  As a result, changes have been made to improve the campus culture, such as:

•	Domestic partner benefits – the University of Louisville was the first state-supported university in Kentucky to adopt domestic partner benefits to qualifying adults.

•	Gender- Neutral restrooms – several restrooms on campus were converted to gender-neutral restrooms in response to the need to be sensitive to members of the campus community who are gender non-conforming or transgender.  In addition, gender-neutral restrooms will be a part of all new campus constructions.

•	Cultural Center – a Cultural Center was developed to facilitate and enhance cultural programming and education to the campus community.

•	Hispanic/Latino Initiative – an initiative designed to empower Hispanic/Latino(a)s to earn a college degree at the University of Louisville and create an environment in which they can enrich their lives and the community.

Commission on the Status of Women - In 1994, the Commission on the Status of Women (COSW) organized a report which presented the status of women in all employment categories and recommended changes to improve the climate for women and all UofL employees.  In 2008-2009, COSW organized an update to the original 1994 report.  The members of COSW analyzed and reviewed each of the objectives and recommendations to ascertain whether progress has been made towards outcomes for the identified goals.  As part of the methodology for this review, the COSW conducted 10 focus groups and individual interviews with campus leaders.   UofL policies, procedures, publications and programs were reviewed.  Based on the findings, the Commission on the Status of Women made recommendations regarding representation, recruitment, retention, campus environment and integration of work and family life for women. The Provost has appointed the Vice Provost for Diversity to serve as the point person in addressing these recommendations.  (http://louisville.edu/cosw/)  

Commission on Diversity and Racial Equality (CODRE) - Working collaboratively with Institutional Research, CODRE’s Campus Environment Team completed a diversity study in 2014, summarized the data, and developed recommendations that were compiled and sent to the President and Provost. The recommendations were organized around a three-year strategy for implementation.

Campus Safety Survey - In January 2010, the PEACC program (Prevention, Education and Advocacy on Campus and in the Community), conducted a confidential online survey to a random sample of participants to assess campus violence experiences and perceptions at UofL.  Survey results will provide important information to enable UofL to create programming and improve safety services to students, staff and faculty. (https://louisville.edu/peacc/)

Employee Resource Groups - The Black Faculty/Staff Association (BFSA) and Hispanic/Latino Faculty and Staff Association (HLFSA) conducted focus groups to assess the attitudes of employees related to compensation, access to information, and climate for staff.  In collaboration with the Staff Senate, recommendations were shared with university administrators and changes were made to improve the campus environment for staff at the university.

In addition, the Vice Provost for Diversity and International Affairs hosts periodic meetings (formally and informally) with students, faculty and staff from under-represented groups to get their opinions and discuss issues or concerns related to diversity, inclusion and campus climate.

The least satisfied groups were Transgender, LGBQ, People of color, Religious minorities, People with disabilities, Political liberals, Agnostics/atheists, and non-native English speakers.

Experiences of harassment (17.8 percent), embracing diversity (14.5 percent), and satisfaction with numerical diversity (34.8 percent) each accounted for significant variance in predicting student “satisfaction with overall climate” with the full model accounting for 66.9 percent of the variance in student ratings. Despite clear influences related to personal experiences of harassment and the general climate, we found that the degree to which “students in general” and “administrators” were perceived to embrace diversity were important.  Moreover, the central predictor of ratings of overall climate were based on “satisfaction with numerical diversity” for students, faculty and staff, which partially mediated the variance accounted for by personal experiences of harassment.

It builds on the diversity plan reports submitted by the academic and administrative units in 2012, institutional data pertaining to the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of the campus community, undergraduate students’ completion and persistence data for gender and racial/ethnic groups, and the recruiting and retention outcomes of faculty and EPA staff.

Compared to the previous unit reports, more reporting units engaged in diversity education and training. Schools incorporated or highlighted diversity content in their courses. Administrative units offered, and in some instances required, various diversity training programs and seminars such as Safe Zone to their students and staff. The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration required all their employees to complete diversity training. 

DMA recommends:
• Building an assessment mechanism, that incorporates setting achievable diversity goals/objectives (short term) and measurable expected outcomes in the planning phase. The assessment mechanism should be part of a retooled process that also incorporates conducting self-evaluation of the actual outcomes. Additionally, the use of a revised reporting template to capture self-evaluation results in the reporting phase can help to measure success and improve efforts in a more effective and systematic way.

In 2010, Carolina conducted its second diversity assessment. There was over 92 percent agreement in responses from students, faculty, and staff that the campus community was well aware of the University’s commitment to diversity. The majority of the respondents agreed that the University demonstrated a commitment to respecting differences of opinion. Approximately 70 percent of the respondents felt that they were valued by the University. However, African American and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander student and faculty respondents, as well as American Indian faculty respondents, were much more likely to experience situations in which they felt marginalized at the University. 

Units conducted diversity related research and secured funds to support diversity related research.

To that end the committee has met, and committee members have interviewed campus areas that have direct impact on these issues. The interview process has led to the identification of many dedicated efforts across campus, both by specific supportive areas and on a collaborative system wide level as well. The process also identified possible efforts that could be considered if additional support and resources became available.

The subcommittee also met with members of the Provost's Task Force for Student Retention and Advising, and the FTLC Learning Community for Faculty and Staff on Advising and Retention to share information and ideas. The subcommittee was impressed by the variety and level of commitment across campus to insuring that the diverse student population was appreciated and supported in their academic success. However, there was recognition that further measures were necessary to assess the effectiveness of these various campus areas. In the Recommendations section, the subcommittee proposed a campus climate survey, an online diversity resource guide, and an institutional effectiveness paradigm.

EXCERPT FROM PAGES 39-41:

In January 2013, UNCG hosted Dr. Timothy K. Eatman, Co-Director of Imagining America: Artists & Scholars in Public Life and Assistant Professor of Higher Education at Syracuse University. The focus of the two-day visit was The Intersection of Diversity, Community Engagement, and Student Success. Dr. Eatman spoke to over 127 faculty, staff, students, and community members on a variety of subjects.

Dialogues facilitated by Eatman included strategies for equity, diversity, and inclusion to improve college access and success of traditionally underserved students the next generation of community-engaged scholars; collaborative technologies; the role of the arts, humanities, and design to re-imagine and reinvigorate scholarship and communities.

Evaluation data collected at each of the workshops suggest that faculty found these workshops useful, and that they are excited to continue leveraging a shared agenda around community engagement, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and student success.
Eatman’s visit was part of the larger UNCG Community Engagement Series (http://communityengagement.uncg.edu/speaker-series.aspx), a collaborative university-wide initiative that brings nationally and locally renowned community engagement scholar-practitioners to campus to engage with faculty, staff, students, and community colleagues.

The 2013 series was sponsored by the Office of the Provost, Institute for Community & Economic Engagement, Office of Leadership and Service-Learning, Faculty Teaching & Learning Commons, School of Health and Human Sciences Office of Community Engagement, Chancellor’s Advisory Committee for Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion, Office of Learning Communities, Coalition for Diverse Language Communities, and the UNCG Public Scholarship Graduate Network.

As a direct result of the planning and successful outcomes of the Series, the director of the Institute for Community and Economic Engagement was asked to serve on the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee for Equity, Diversity and Inclusive Excellence (CACEDIE). The Committee has been charged to review practices and efforts by the academic areas to recruit, retain and engage faculty; the recruitment, retention and graduation success of our undergraduate and graduate student populations, and recruitment and hiring processes on campus. The conversation sparked by Eatman about full participation has persisted into these dialogues and plans.

Diversity efforts are also specifically connected to community engagement within the Center for New North Carolinians through partnerships, programs, grants, professional development, and fellowships. ORED shares best practice in cultural competence with CACEDIE and Human Resources. The Coalition for Diverse Language Communities (http://cdlc.uncg.edu/) was founded by faculty and supported by the School of Education dean and the ORED vice chancellor to promote innovative, relevant, and collaborative work in the areas of community-engaged research, outreach and advocacy, policy work, and professional development. This impressive network includes fellowships for community-engaged scholarship, professional development, grants, publications, and conference and community presentations.

Diversity and inclusion are connected via the QEP topic of Global Engagement as the topic relates to intercultural competence and uses community engagement strategies to teach these abilities and skills. Additionally, the School of Health and Human Sciences Office of Diversity hosted a Faculty Forum on Community Engagement and Diversity. Panelists presented data collected from its faculty and other studies on the interconnections between the two priorities.",http://oedi.uncg.edu/,"Information for this credit was obtained in part from the following UNCG employees:

One example of an assessment administered by The College of The Arts (CoTA) is the College-wide Diversity Climate Survey. In the fall of 2007, the College of The Arts’ Faculty Advisory Council (FAC) and the Diversity Advisory Workgroup (DAW) held a meeting to consider how to address retention and diversity issues regarding under represented faculty and staff.  A representative from the University’s office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity (DEO) also attended this meeting to ensure diversity policies were being upheld by both groups.  At this meeting, members of both the FAC and DAW decided to expand the DAW membership to include representation from the FAC. The DAW is now comprised of faculty and staff from all units in the college; it incorporates the elected membership of the FAC, the appointed membership of the original DAW, and the expressed interest of additional faculty and staff who participate in the expanded DAW group.  
 
In the discussions of a means to identify and understand the questions of retention for the college, it was suggested that the college conduct a diversity climate survey.  The Group worked with DEO to develop two survey instruments for the task.  One survey instrument was administered to Faculty and the other administered to Staff.   Both surveys were administered in April and May of 2008 with responses sent by the individual faculty and staff to the DEO office for summarization.

Their goals include attracting and retaining faculty and staff from under-represented populations; attracting, retaining and graduating students from historically under-represented populations and international students; and ensuring that undergraduate curricular requirements include significant intercultural perspectives. in the past 3 years their annual reports have assessed the following issues:
1. A consistent challenge identified by the Council is the inability to get campus and UT System administration to expand the format of survey tools to be more inclusive of underrepresented populations. As it currently stands, campus and UT System surveys do not reflect, or include, the multiple constituencies that are part of the make up on each campus. (2013-2014)
2.The 2012‐2013 academic year was a fruitful one for the Council of Diversity and Interculturalism (CDI). Co‐chaired by Dr. Herb Byrd and Mr. Tyvi Small and consisting of approximately 21 members, CDI along with the Commissions for Blacks, LGBT People, and Women served as very active participants in the campus’ efforts to recruit and hire a Vice Chancellor for Diversity and Inclusion.
