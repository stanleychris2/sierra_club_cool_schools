March 2013: Diverse Learning Environments Survey disseminated to representative group of sophomores and juniors for baseline information; currently reviewing potential to use one survey that addresses students, staff, and faculty climate issues. 
Staff and Faculty Hiring Guides were developed to include best practices for diversifying the applicant pool and addressing implicit bias and other potential barriers to recruiting, hiring, and retaining a high quality, diverse faculty and staff. Training is associated with the use of the guide. 
Concerted effort to review policies and practices with a critical lens for diversity and equity is underway. This is an ongoing-long term process.

Haverford does not offer any financial aid on the basis of academic, musical, athletic, or any other evaluation of merit. Rather, Haverford will meet the full demonstrated need of all admitted students who were judged eligible according to the College's formula and procedures.

One of the findings was that the university needs to develop a longitudinal university-wide climate assessment program that includes regular collection of data and the implementation of strategies to address the findings. The full report is available online: http://oregonstate.edu/oei/self-study-report.  In response to these findings, OSU launched the first annual Campus Climate Survey in early calendar year 2014.  In January and February 2014 the survey was open.  Findings and more information are available here: http://oregonstate.edu/oei/climate-assessment

During April and May 2015, Oregon State University piloted and distributed the Campus Inclusivity Survey. Students (undergraduate, international, graduate) as well as representatives from various academic departments, the graduate school, and several student affairs departments worked together to create a survey to assess inclusivity on campus.  4,000 OSU students selected at random were invited to participate in the pilot Campus Inclusivity Survey.

This survey discussed everything from attitudinal barriers experienced by those with lived experience as well as captured the attitudes without lived experience. The survey also asked about future learning and development opportunities as well as preferences for receiving further information. Additionally, the Diversity & Equity Office conducted a needs assessment 2 years ago for faculty and staff on issues related to equity and inclusion. The feedback we receive in this area is integrated through workshop assessment forms when we deliver training as part of our inclusive excellence certificate program. Further, in 2012 the Diversity & Equity Office completed an Employment Equity Report to provide the community with an update on Laurier’s employment equity related initiatives.
