1) Energy Management System 
Four full time staff manage the university’s Siemens Apogee energy management system (EMS), which monitors campus HVAC systems, including certain air quality components such as CO sensors, CO2 sensors, and humidity sensors. The EMS is designed to control indoor air quality as well as trigger staff response when the system detects air quality indicators beyond pre-set allowable ranges. The system is monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

2) Occupant Feedback 
“2FIX” is the campus-wide customer feedback system for facilities-related inquiries and complaints. Building occupants use this system, which includes a phone hotline and email address (202.885.2FIX and 2FIX@american.edu), to provide feedback on indoor air quality. Calls and emails to 2FIX produce work tickets for response by professional facilities staff people. If/when facilities staff are unable to resolve an indoor air quality complaint, it is referred to Risk Management for additional inquiry and action.

3) Staff Observation 
Facilities staff are trained to observe and act to prevent and/or re-mediate sources of potential impacts on indoor air quality, such as observing vehicle fumes penetrating a building, visible mold growth, and other such indicators of potential air contamination.

4) The Green Cleaning Program 
Minimizes the amount of dirt entering buildings by using entryway mats, thereby avoiding overuse of cleaning chemicals. It trains staff on safe chemical handling and cleaning practices in order to avoid exposing them to chemicals. We also use Green Seal-certified cleaners and equipment that are verified against a rigorous, nationally recognized standard for identifying greener cleaning supplies. A large portion of cleaning is done using the Orbio OS3: a chemical and VOC free disinfection solution generator.

Appalachian State has a written procedure for reporting indoor air quality complaints (see http://safety.appstate.edu/indoor-air-quality) and conducts routine preventative maintenance of the HVAC equipment.
 
General description of IAQ response:

* If the concern seems mechanical (e.g. HVAC) system or leak-related, then directed to Physical Plant.

* If the concern seems related to an obvious source of non-life-threatening contamination (e.g. fumes from idling vehicles or construction equipment/activities), the source of the activity is asked to cease the activity and/or relocate the activity.

* If the concern seems related to anything else, then the Occupational Safety & Health Office visits the site and investigates to the extent appropriate.  

* If the concern sounds at all like life or health is threatened, The Occupational Safety & Health Office goes immediately to the location to investigate.  These are chemical exposure issues, not IAQ.

Reference guidance was obtained from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Georgia State University Radon Management Plan.  Among those consulted and offering assistance to Beloit College is a member of the University of Kentucky's Environmental Health and Safety Division. They have an online fact sheet that offers some useful information regarding radon plus that division’s work on testing and how they address this issue on its Lexington, Kentucky campus.  Beloit College then formed a radon committee and hired an industrial hygiene consultant to provide direction with the testing and creation of a mitigation process.  Additional tests were then completed the week of April 25 in buildings located on the south side of campus which have lower level occupants. 

Results of tests:  
To date, all reported levels have been within the amount deemed acceptable (below 32.7pCi/L) for a 40-hour work week by OSHA and ACGIH, governmental and non-governmental agencies concerned with worker safety and industrial hygiene.  A record of testing locations, results, and actions taken can be found on an internally accessible page.

Radon monitoring activities are ongoing on-campus, since exposures can change over time due to factors such as climate, increase/decrease in air flow, and building/foundation age.  Occupied areas with slightly elevated levels are to be tested quarterly, while unoccupied spaces will be tested biannually. Areas with levels at or below the EPA standard of 4 pCi/L for residential air quality will be retested annually.

When CI’s CO2 levels rise from the set 800 PPM, the controls automatically open the outside air dampers to introduce more fresh air and remove the CO2 content. 
To keep the conditions comfortable and ensure a proper flushing of contaminates, CI has adopted an ASHRAE (The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards of a minimum of four air changes per hour. In addition, CI performs annual checks of CO2 sensors that provide the primary input for controlling the concentration of CO2. 
Another key element in ensuring the proper CO2 levels and particulate filtration, CI has a preventative maintenance (PM) program in place to ensure correct equipment and filtering operation. The dust efficiency ratings for the HVAC air filters are high efficiency filters (85%). They are changed during the normal scheduled PM process or if the system detects a high differential pressure across the filter. To ensure the reliability of the filtration all filter bank seals are inspected during PM’s.

Once the potential for an air contaminant is identified as a potential source of a problem, then air sampling can be considered.  However, unlike air contaminants found in an industrial setting generated from a specific process, there are few regulatory limits associated with most of the items of concern related to general indoor air quality.  For example, the OSHA permissible exposure limit for carbon dioxide is 5000 ppm (parts per million) based on an 8 hour average.  In a normal academic setting you would probably never see a measurement that high as typically the only source of carbon dioxide inside a building is from the products of normal human respiration (i.e. exhaled air).  Taking a measurement in the morning and the evening in a particular location can show if there is a buildup of carbon dioxide throughout the day, therefore indicating if more outside air is needed in a particular space.

Excerpt from OESO Standard Operating Procedures - 
Phase 1 investigations are the initial step in evaluating whether a reported IAQ concern is significantly affecting the health of the occupants in the area. In the majority of cases, IAQ evaluations will be resolved in this phase.

Process
Step 1 – Initiation: When contacted about an IAQ problem, the complainant is referred to http://www.safety.duke.edu/OHS/IAQ.htm for self help. This page links the complainant to information and other resources, including the appropriate maintenance dept. In the case that self-help does not work or is not considered suitable, the complainant may choose to request an investigation through the link to TMS.
Step 2 – Scheduling of investigation. Upon receipt of the TMS work request, OESO will assign staff (and copy the appropriate territory person) to conduct the initial investigation.  The assigned staff member will schedule the investigation directly with the area supervisor.
Step 3 – Investigation – the surveyor will visit the area, conduct an initial investigation consisting of basic measurements and observations to ascertain the cause of concern. OESO's investigation procedure provides guidance on what to look for and also serves as documentation of the visit.

filtration capacity in university-owned and operated buildings. One indicator to measure progress toward this target is the number of plantings in indoor spaces. The university is exploring potential tactics to achieve this target including:

1) Encourage the adoption of interior green spaces (such as living walls and biophyllic design) in new construction and major renovation design.
2) Encourage the adoption of potted plants or other greenery as part of the Green Office Network.
3) Purchase materials and equipment comprised of non-toxic or less toxic components (e.g., low volatile organic compounds (VOC) carpets and paints, green cleaning products, Green Guard/Green Seal products, FloorScore hard surface flooring, Green Label carpeting).
4) Achieve Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) LEED credit 3.2 where the intent is “to reduce indoor air quality problems resulting from construction or renovation to promote the comfort and well-being of construction workers and building occupants” in projects where LEED certification is targeted.
5) Assess air handling & filtration technology.
6) Ensure HVAC systems are properly maintained (regular filter change, coils cleaning and repair of damaged parts).
7) Maintain and evaluate a green or blue cleaning program.
8) Ensure interior spaces are properly sealed off during building construction/renovation projects.

Commissioning is a comprehensive engineering analysis of the operation and performance of a building’s systems, including HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) and lighting systems. The methodical process ensures building performance, reduces energy use, improves indoor air quality and meets occupants' needs.

Commissioning occurs during the new construction process, in existing buildings and with newly installed systems to sustain efficiency.

2.	Scope:   University wide. The University recognizes the impact that indoor air quality has in the workplace.  In an effort to provide the University Community with the optimum level of indoor air quality, Environmental Health and Safety has developed an indoor air quality program.

Symptoms arising from poor indoor air quality often mimic those symptoms commonly associated with a cold, flu or allergies. These symptoms may include upper respiratory irritation, congestion, headaches, nausea, fatigue and itchy or watery eyes. Through our indoor air quality program of occupant interviews, building inspection and air quality testing, Environmental Health and Safety is often able to determine the cause of indoor air quality problems.

The objectives of this program include the following:

➢	To prevent illness and adverse health symptoms associated with poor indoor air quality
➢	To respond to indoor quality complaints effectively and to make recommendations for improvement;
➢	To maintain indoor air quality within acceptable levels according to consensus guidelines.

Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide (CO2), a major product of human respiration, is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. Ordinary outside air in urban areas normally contain about 350 to 500 parts per million (ppm). ASHRAE standard 62-1989 (Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality) recommends that CO2 levels be maintained below 1,000 ppm.

Contamination From Inside the Building:  Contaminants commonly found inside the building include:
➢	Ozone from copiers
➢	Cleaning agents
➢	New furniture and carpets
➢	Sewer gas from dry traps
➢	Appliances not properly maintained
➢	Pesticides
➢	Cosmetics
➢	Humidification devices

Contamination From Outside the Building:  Contamination commonly found outside of buildings include:
➢	Exhaust from motor vehicles
➢	Fumes from construction or renovation activities

Inadequate Ventilation:  Inadequate ventilation occurs when an insufficient amount of fresh outside air is supplied to the interior environment.

Microbial Contamination:  Microbial Contamination occurs in buildings that are susceptible to water leaks and other sources of moisture. Contaminants can also be introduced into buildings from stagnant water in HVAC air distribution systems and cooling towers. In general, prevention of microbiological contamination is accomplished by eliminating standing water and other sources of moisture ((draft) Mold and Water-Damaged Building Materials Management Policy).

Relative Humidity
Relative humidity levels can affect the release rate of many indoor contaminants, their concentrations in the air, and the potential growth of microbial organisms. Humidity can also have a direct effect on worker comfort. In ASHRAE 55-1981, a “comfort chart” shows an acceptable range of humidity to be from 20 to 60%.

Temperature
Temperature ranges of 73 degrees F to 79 degrees F during the winter months, and 69 to 75 during the summer months are recommended by ASHRAE. These guidelines are intended to achieve thermal conditions in a given environment that at least 80% of persons who occupy that environment will find it acceptable or “comfortable”.

6.	Procedures:  
IAQ Investigation

Phase I Assessment
The first step in a typical IAQ investigation is a Phase I or preliminary assessment. Phase I assessments include interviewing occupants using an employee questionnaire and occupant diary (see appendix) and performing a walk-through inspection of the building or area of complaint. The questionnaire is used to obtain information about the nature of the employee complaints and symptoms and also to determine the magnitude of the problem.

During the walk-through, building ventilation systems are evaluated and potential sources of contamination are identified. If the immediate cause or source cannot be found, a Phase II assessment is required.

Phase II Assessment
During a Phase II assessment, common indoor air quality parameters including temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide levels are measured.

The most commonly cited quantitative measurements of indoor air quality are provided by ASHRAE, American Society of Heating and Air Conditioning Engineers, as presented in standard 62-1989.

Phase III Assessment
A Phase III Assessment is performed when a definitive cause for the symptoms cannot be determined during the Phase II Assessment of the investigation.

Phase III Assessments consists of extensive and more specific monitoring and sampling for chemical and/or microbial contaminants.  Environmental Health and Safety often contracts Phase III Assessments to Professional Indoor Air Consultants. In our final report for a Phase III investigation, our office will typically recommend that the occupant seek the services of an occupational health physician.

The UBC program on IAQ provides an organized approach on how to prevent and resolve IAQ concerns within building offices and other non-industrial work spaces occupied by UBC staff so that the quality of air is in compliance with provincial regulations and federal guidelines. The IAQ program is applicable to all buildings owned and/or maintained by UBC. 

As described in the IAQ program, to avoid the occurrence of poor IAQ, preventative maintenance checks are carried out on building HVAC systems, heating and cooling pumps, as well as other mechanical systems by UBC Building Operations. These audits are used to identify and correct potential mechanical deficiencies that may lead to poor IAQ. 

In cases where an IAQ issue still arises, the occupants experiencing symptoms or concerns are asked to inform their supervisor, building administrator, and/or local health and safety committee and complete an IAQ Referral Form so that an investigation can be initiated. The IAQ Referral Form is used to gather more background information and can help narrow down potential causes/pollutants leading to poor IAQ. Once the IAQ Referral Form is completed, either the Facilities Manager or Risk Management Services should be notified depending on the parameter that requires further investigation. For example, concerns about temperature levels, relative humidity, and drafts from diffusers are investigated by the Facilities Manager while concerns regarding chemicals, mold, and unusual odors will be looked after by Risk Management Services. A general walk-through and evaluation of the area of concern is then carried out where appropriate observations are noted, interviews are conducted, and measurements are made. Building drawings and plans, especially for the HVAC system, may also be consulted for additional information. Upon completion of the investigation, the source causing poor IAQ will be identified and the necessary controls will be developed and implemented to resolve the issue.

Indoor Air Quality Management Program Summary

A broad Indoor Air Quality Management Policy that covers IAQ issues throughout the University of Florida is active and was developed based on the EPA’s Building Air Quality guide and on EPA’s Tools for Schools IAQ management program guidelines.

Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) at UF is coordinated by the Environmental Health and Safety Department (EH&S). An EH&S certified industrial hygienist serves as the UF IEQ Coordinator, and acts as a central point of contact for IAQ issues. 

With over 900 buildings on the University’s Gainesville campus, regular active monitoring by EH&S is not currently feasible. However, educational programs and shared responsibility expectations for physical plant staff, building occupants, construction project managers, and contractors are covered in the IEQ Policy and procedures.  IAQ concerns are investigated on a case by case basis. Each IAQ concern is entered into a log that notes the dates that the concern is received and evaluated, the location and the specific actions taken.

Specifications and guidance on a detailed range of IAQ issues are provided on the EH&S website (http://www.ehs.ufl.edu/IH/IEQ.htm).

An IAQ protocol with guidelines related to maximum limits for various comfort parameters in University buildings has been in place for several years. Since there are currently no regulations in effect covering indoor air quality in a non-industrial environment, we follow the recommendations of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).

Air contaminants sources can be biological in nature (mold, dust mites and other allergens), or chemical (formaldehyde, carbon monoxide) and can originate either inside or outside a building. Physical factors (temperature and relative humidity) can contribute to perceptions of poor air quality as well. Air sampling is rarely undertaken, as often, adjustments to the HVAC system or better housekeeping are all that is needed. 

Moreover, the entire University is covered by our IAQ program, including its off site facilities. The IAQ program is also one of many of the Industrial Hygiene Division’s (two FTE and one part time student) responsibilities. The effort to provide good indoor air quality in all work spaces is supported by the Building Services’ Green Seal Certification, preventative and corrective maintenance  of ventilation systems by Facilities Management HVAC mechanics, associated University policies, such as the No Smoking Policy, Mold Management Policy, and the Environmental Management Policy

The system we have in place is self-monitoring for levels of CO2 and is set to adjust dampers on demand for increase fresh air according to sensor levels. In other words, if a room is occupied and CO2 levels increase above 1000 ppm, the system will open dampers to increase fresh air delivery. The system will also detect periods of low occupancy and self-calibrate the CO2 sensors during those times. The air handling system will also determine problems with sensors if readings fall below atmospheric conditions by sending an alarm. High CO2 levels will also trigger an alarm, but rarely happens as the minimum levels for opening dampers occur well before reaching alarm levels.
Individuals with air quality concerns are prompted to complete a hazard/incident report form, but usually the person sends an email. Generally, when a concern is expressed, either through email or by report, it generates an action plan to address the concern and the file remains open until the concern is adequately addressed.

July 2011- Environmental Health & Safety ___________________________________________________

Description:
The College recognizes the impact that indoor air quality (IAQ) has in the workplace. In an effort to provide the community with the optimum level of indoor air quality, the Environmental Health and Safety Office has developed an indoor air quality program. The objectives of this program include the following:
- Prevent illness and adverse health symptoms associated with poor indoor air quality
- Respond to indoor quality complaints effectively and to make recommendations for improvement;
- Maintain indoor air quality within acceptable levels according to consensus guidelines.

Overview:
The Office of Health and Human Services with the MA Department of Public Health states “indoor air quality problems generally fall into three general categories:
1. Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) operations;
2. Indoor microbial growth indoors
3. Indoor/outdoor sources of respiratory irritants/vapors/gases/particulates.”

Specific regulations have not been developed for IAQ in the workplace, however, EHS does consider recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, the American Industrial Hygiene Association and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning. We also use OSHA and EPA regulations and guidelines.
Symptoms that can be associated with poor indoor air quality include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat; headaches; dizziness; and rashes. Additionally, according to OSHA, poor indoor air can be linked to muscle pain and fatigue, asthma, hypersensitivity and pneumonitis.

IAQ Investigation
Early identification is important for addressing indoor air quality. Occupants with IAQ concerns should submit an IAQ Questionnaire available on line to the EHS Office. Be sure to notify your supervisor of the situation. Phase I Assessment The first step in a typical IAQ investigation is a Phase I or preliminary assessment. Phase I assessments include interviewing occupants using an employee questionnaire and occupant diary and performing a walk-through inspection of the building or area of complaint. The questionnaire is used to obtain information about the nature of the employee complaints and symptoms and also to determine the magnitude of the problem.

During the walk-through, building ventilation systems are evaluated and potential sources of contamination are identified. If the immediate cause or source cannot be found, a Phase II assessment is required. Phase II Assessment During a Phase II assessment, common indoor air quality parameters including temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide levels are measured. Phase III Assessment A Phase III Assessment is performed when a definitive cause for the symptoms cannot be determined during the Phase II Assessment of the investigation. Phase III Assessments consists of extensive and more specific monitoring and sampling for chemical and/or microbial contaminants. Environmental Health and Safety often contracts Phase III Assessments to Professional Indoor Air Consultants.

IAQ During Construction and Renovation Projects
Construction and renovation projects present a variety of situations which may release contaminants and pollutants that can impact the IAQ of a building. They may be transported to other areas via the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and affect populations beyond the immediate project area. Advance planning by Project Managers, appropriate contract language, material review and selection, and effective control strategies combined with proactive communication can successfully control pollutant levels, allay concerns, and maintain occupant comfort during and after construction activities.

Prevention
Many IAQ issues can be avoided. Timely maintenance, building repair and the rapid response to water intrusion into a building can prevent an issue from occurring. Occupants also have a responsibility to report situations and to use buildings as designed. Other ways to maintain a healthy environment include: No smoking in College buildings or in close proximity to building ventilation systems (e.g. an air intake). Prohibition of hazardous chemical use without proper training, authorization and equipment. Many experts suggest the use of common house plants to remove contaminants from indoor air.
The EHS Office is available to work with building occupants, maintenance and project managers to control and or eliminate contaminants, sources and hazards that may impact IAQ.",http://www.wellesley.edu/safety/programs/air_quality_indoor,--
