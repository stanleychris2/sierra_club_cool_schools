REPORTING PROCEDURES FOR INDOOR AIR QUALITY (IAQ) CONCERNS

    Inform your supervisor of your concern. Be specific and give all pertinent details.
    Supervisor investigates.
    If both agree there is an air quality problem, the supervisor takes corrective action by contacting  facilities for repair or maintenance. The majority of IAQ situations are the result of breakdowns in the air handling systems.
    If the source of the problem is unknown, facilities will contact Safety, Health, Environment & Risk Management (SHERM) for further investigating and testing.
    For any Indoor Air Quality Issue which involves a health related concern or potential health concern please refer to and complete to the Indoor Air Quality Reporting Form.  The completed form should be forwarded to the SHERM.
