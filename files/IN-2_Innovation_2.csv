This work was stimulated by the commitment of funding from the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors under the banner of the Clean Energy Campus Campaign (as a part of its 8 million-metric-ton Carbon Reduction Initiative). Under this initiative, Chevrolet committed to the purchase of carbon reduction credits from colleges and universities with the intent of retiring them against the climate and not using them to offset its own corporate admissions.

Developing the methodology, testing its application and implementing its use involved collaboration with Chevrolet, Climate Neutral Business Network (CNBN), Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), and Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF). Once operational the methodology was adopted by ten other colleges universities.
","As result, there now exists a methodology accredited by Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) for use by colleges and universities in establishing the validity and verification of their carbon reductions for transaction in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). Such transaction enables those colleges and universities to cultivate a line of capital resource for driving further carbon reductions.

Now that the piloting work has been completed, a new agreement among a handful of the participating universities has been established with Second Nature (SN) as agent for the future aggregation of carbon reductions by colleges and universities for transaction in the VCM.

This new enterprise will permit some 700 signatories to the ACUPCC to embark upon participation in VCM as a way to aggregate funds to drive their carbon reductions more deeply, more quickly.

Bowdoin College,2016-02-25,2016-02-25 17:01:07,cpayson@bowdoin.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Green Athletics,"Bowdoin’s Sustainability Office works closely with the College’s Green Athletics student group, which focuses on incorporating sustainability into the College’s Athletic Department and within individual teams.  The group’s main initiative for the last two years has been “The Green Athletics Team Challenge,” where sports teams commit to sustainability goals and compete against each other for an annual Athletic Department award and a cash prize for their team. 

The team challenges range from using reusable water bottles and recycling on trips to taking shorter showers and going trayless in the dining halls. Representatives from Green Athletics meet with teams at the beginning of their season to make any changes to the team challenges based on team structure or personality. For example, some teams don’t have a locker room while others have tailgates at games instead of buying food at a restaurant, and all of these nuances impact a team’s ability to complete different challenges. In addition to the challenges provided by Green Athletics, teams are encouraged to come up with new actions that count towards their total. These are scored by Green Athletics based on creativity, difficulty, and impact. 

Teams are given a team-specific score sheet to keep track of their points and each week the team “Eco-Rep,” a volunteer position, emails Green Athletics their score. Green Athletics then updates a large scoreboard outside of Bowdoin’s Fitness Center so students can easily see how their efforts rank against other teams in their season. At the end of each season, teams that have scored more than a target number are invited to an end-of-season celebration with complementary food at the College’s Pub. The event features a video from Bowdoin’s Athletic Director congratulating them on their efforts and pictures showing what actions the teams did that season. The winning team of each season gets $100 for their program and qualifies for the Athletic Department Green Team award, announced at the annual Sports Award Banquet, which comes with an additional $200 prize. 

The Challenge began during the 2014-2015 academic year and had a very successful first year, with 14 teams completing all of their challenges and over 22 teams completing at least one. Some notable actions included the Men’s Hockey team collecting recyclable bottle caps to raise money for the Ronald McDonald House and the Volleyball team composting on the bus for every away game. The Crew team won the first Green Athletics award for hosting a campus Erg-a-thon to raise money for the local Nature Conservancy, the organization that protects the river they row on. 

About 60% of Bowdoin students participate in varsity or intramural sports, and this new initiative allows our office to engage with these students in a fun and competitive way. The 2nd annual Team Challenge is currently underway, and has been tweaked slightly based on feedback from athletes and coaches. In addition, we have had several students from other schools ask us for advice as they start similar efforts within their Athletic Departments. We are very proud to be at the forefront of this movement and look forward to making an even greater impact during each season to come.",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/223/6/583/3271/green_athletics_innovation.pdf,**,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--

The restoration was developed because of discovery of species with status of concern like the Lee's Bell Vireo native bird. This restoration has been on-going for four years now and will likely continue into the future. Unlike most restoration projects, the campus community is an integral part of the success of native species, and habitat in the riparian and wetland areas. Students work alongside the Ground Department, contracted ecologists, faculty, and staff to plant native flora, and remove invasive species that would otherwise outcompete important native species. Over the first four years of this long-term project, bare ground and invasive/non-native species have decreased significantly and has led to a more resilient and productive plant and habitat community. Along with restoration, numerous senior students have conducted research in the creek to determine the benefits, and future plans for the area. Riparian and wetland communities in and around campus are scarce and majorly disturbed, so the important of restoring these ecosystems is immeasurable. They not only provide invaluable habitat for species like the Least Bell's Vireo, but they are also carbon sinks that help the campus offset carbon emissions from energy production and use.

The conceptual goal was to build and operate a food waste to good-food system that demonstrates key waste management issues, ecological principles (trophic levels, nitrogen cycle, etc.), and nutrition concepts. The system uses aquaponics, the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, combined with earthworm and insect processing of the food wastes to produce protein as a substantial component of the fish food, typically one of the most costly and ecologically damaging inputs to fish production.  This goal provides an academic context for addressing the full range of issues about sustainability.The practical goal is to develop a pilot-scale system to demonstrate how all the campus food waste can be processed.  There have been efforts at composting in the past, but there were concerns about odors, food safety, and the low economic value of the products.  The academic value of this goal is in linking theoretical issues in sustainability with practical, institutional issues and daily experiences that provide immediate learning opportunities.

As Chatham increases the number of students that live on the Eden Hall campus, and in order to stay sustainable, we needed to implement innovative water treatment processes that would not stress Richland Township's already struggling water systems. We designed an on-lot sanitary system that makes use of a constructed wetland and grey water system for all of our campus buildings. With primary treatment tanks at each building, waste runs through biological trickling filters into a constructed wetland that is also a pollinator-friendly, native plant garden. It then goes to a recirculating sand filter and then on to mechanical filtration and ultra violet disinfection station.

Supported by a $2 million challenge grant from the Partridge Foundation, FMI seeks solutions that will sustain island and coastal ecosystems while sharing models for sustainability from around the world. 

FMI addresses four areas of critical, local concern: agriculture and food; energy; education; and adaption to climate change. With joint programming, shared intellectual resources, and coordinated fundraising, FMI seeks to develop solutions in an academic setting that can then be brought to reality through the work of community members and students, creating a new model for community development and higher education.

The first major project of FMI was the Collaborative for Island Energy Research and Action (CIERA). This brought together COA staff and students, FMI members, and residents of surrounding communities for an energy leadership program intensive in the 2014-2015 academic year which was designed to build local capacity for transforming Maine’s energy future.

As part of CIERA, the interdisciplinary course “Islands: Energy, Economy and Community” brought students and community members from Maine’s Islands to Samsø Island in Denmark, where they learned about the Samsø experience of transforming to a carbon negative island through a community driven, grassroots approach. CIERA has also inspired a number of follow-up projects, including research on local agriculture, and after-school program to bring students and island communities in touch with their agricultural heritage, community home energy audit programs, and K-12 programs focused on strengthening student engagement in schools on Maine’s islands and coast.

The library will be constructed throughout the 2017-18 academic year and is designed as a holistic building system to achieve the net-zero performance. There are four tenets of this system design achieving net-zero performance: 1.) building efficiency and conservation, 2.)  Onsite combined heat and power, 3.) distributed heat generation and storage, and 4.) photovoltaics to offset carbon emissions associated with combined heat and power. The net-zero library design uses these elements in its plan for the first library of its kind. The Colorado College Campus Sustainability Council was integral in the creation of the net-zero library design drafting a resolution and taking a unanimous vote in the spring of 2015.","CC's current library uses about 6% of the total campus energy. The creation of a net-zero library will have a large impact on CC's carbon footprint and energy consumption. The library design incorporates PV solar power as well as sustainable investments to offset carbon emissions both of which have significant impacts on local industry. Colorado College is the first school of its kind to design a net-zero library at this scale (97,000+ square feet) operating 24 hours per day.

This innovation credit is a meant to demonstrate a purpose driven space built to LEED Platinum standards to house sustainability programs that go above and beyond the typical ""sustainable research"" points in STARS. 

The Energy Institute at Colorado State University, which coordinates energy-related research across campus, is headquartered at the Powerhouse Energy Campus. Thirteen campus-wide research centers are affiliated with the Institute. This is CSU’s epicenter of Energy Research. 

The Institute aims to grow the impact, reach, and reputation of energy research and education at Colorado State University by increasing collaboration with industry and governmental partners, creating new research and educational opportunities for CSU faculty and students, and accelerating the dissemination of CSU solutions.

This cross-campus, interdisciplinary effort is operated under the Office of the Vice President for Research. The extensive network of researchers, research programs, and centers, spans all eight colleges at CSU, and extends off campus to a global network of public and private partners.
","Both the programs housed within this center, as well as some its building features qualify it for a STARS Innovation point: 
-	The old coal hopper has been replaced with a greenhouse in which researchers can grow biofuel feedstocks. The smokestacks houses four vertical-axis wind turbines.  
-	The Powerhouse Campus achieves 50 percent to 55 percent energy savings when compared to other commercial/industrial buildings – well above the 48 percent required to meet LEED Platinum status. The Powerhouse does not contain a traditional air conditioning system. Instead, the building is cooled by a 26-mile network of tubing that circulates chilled water.  The system relies on Colorado’s cool nightly temperatures to chill the water, and uses a predictive control system that monitors the building in relationship to the weather forecast.
-	The current array of rooftop solar panels generates 20 kilowatts of electricity, which will help power the building.  Additional panels will be installed in 2015 and will produce another 25 kilowatts of power.
-	The metal panels on the outside of the addition are the same as what is used in commercial freezer systems. The pre-finished, interlocking panels help prevent air leaking from the building.
-	The building’s fiberglass window frames and glass pane have an R-value of 7.5, more than two times higher than the energy efficiency rating of conventional aluminum window frame systems.
-	The entire building is outfitted with customized low-voltage LED lights that attach to ceiling with magnets. Heat from the lights is absorbed by the floor slabs and is transferred back into the system.

This focused on where potable water was being used that could be replaced with non-potable water such as irrigation, cooling towers, etc). In 2008, a feasibility study identified that a water reclamation pond could greatly reduce the use of potable water for one of the on-campus chiller plants, which is responsible for the cooling of 86 buildings.

The two year development project which started in 2013 was completed in the spring of 2015. The $11.5 million investment led to the creation of a 12 acre area that is complete with a 5 acre pond, walking trails, and over 40,000 new trees, shrubs, and grasses. This pond will help reduce the potable water use by the chiller plant by providing upwards of 100 million gallons of water to the chiller plant.","This project will help reduce Duke's total potable water use on campus by 20%. 
Aside from the reduction of potable water use by 100 million gallons per year, the pond will collect rainwater and runoff from 22 percent of the main campus area. Duke also estimates savings of $400,000 per year by using storm water in lieu of potable city water.

With a footprint that includes 360,000 buildings, 650,000 fleet vehicles, and $445 billion spent annually on goods and services, the Federal Government’s actions to reduce pollution, support renewable energy, and operate more efficiently can make a significant impact on national emissions and drive progress across the Federal supply chain.
President Obama signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13693, Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, in March 2015. Goals of the E.O. include cutting the Federal Government’s greenhouse gas emissions 40% over the next ten years from 2008 levels and increasing the share of electricity the Federal Government consumes from renewable sources to 30% by 2025. 
In May 2015, the GW Sustainability Collaborative began collaborating with the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to promote sustainability efforts across the Federal Government.  GW and CEQ partnered to host a GreenGov Symposium and GreenGov Dialogue to bring together public, private, and non-profit leaders to discuss the E.O. and determine strategies to meet the challenge put forth by President Obama.  GW has also been asked to produce sustainability case studies that analyze exemplary Federal Government actions and that will be used as critical training material for federal managers. 
","GW and CEQ held the GreenGov Symposium on June 10, 2015. The packed auditorium hosted over 200 federal sustainability managers, GW faculty, students, and NGO and private sector sustainability leaders. Another 1,200 online viewers watched the event’s live stream from forty-two states and eight countries. Forty-eight speakers participated throughout the day, including Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy. 
The first of two GreenGov Dialogues was held on September 11, 2015. With twenty presentations related to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) over the course one morning, the discussion was productive and dynamic. An insightful group of stakeholders discussed the potential for multi-party federal PPAs, the agreements’ structures, and the constraints in an effort to meet federal clean energy goals. The dialogue was also recorded for later use in a GreenGov case study on PPAs. 
The GreenGov case study effort is underway after GW’s review of the over 1,100 GreenGov nominations submitted to the GreenGov Presidential Awards from 2010 to 2015. GW decided for its initial case to examine biobased products and purchasing after its appearance in over forty nominations. The case features biobased acquisition at the Kennedy Space Center and includes shorter pieces on other federal, private, and non-profit biobased efforts. The biobased case and future cases will be hosted on an interactive website free to the public currently found at www.GWCaseStudies.com.

Green Mountain College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:55:21,ihrker@greenmtn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Sustainability Skills Curriculum and Certificate,"In 2011 Green Mountain College began offering one credit courses that aim to teach students discrete, practical sustainability skills and knowledge. The Transition Town movement, with its emphasis on re-localization, advocates reskilling the population, so that communities need not rely on experts from afar for many products and services.  We believe that in order to flourish maid the age of climate change, our students will need wide range of building, gardening, finance and group facilitation skills. We understand the term “sustainability” to embrace practices which enable us to positively impacts our communities ecologically, social and economically, so we call these courses, collectively the “sustainability skills curriculum.“

In 2015 we introduced the Sustainability Skills certificate. Any student who successfully completes six distinct sustainability skills courses earns a sustainability skills certificate.  The College has offered more than 20 different sustainability skills courses, usually at least 10 sections per year.  Programs ranging from Renewable Energy and Ecological Design,  and  Sustainable Food Systems to Animal Conservation and Care, and Adventure Education offer such courses, which include titles like the following:   Beekeeping, Bike Repair and Maintenance, Home Energy Audit, Solar Panel  Installation, Cheesemaking, Wildcrafting,  Permaculture, Draft Animal Power, and Personal Finance.  They typically involve only limited treatment of theory, history or background knowledge relevant to the practice and focus simply on teaching the skill. This curriculum provides an opportunity for the College to engage skilled professionals in the region and to strengthen the connection between the College and surrounding communities.  Faculty for these courses must have demonstrated expertise in the skills to be taught, but they need not have a terminal degree in a related field. ","Most  Sustainability Skills courses fill with a waiting list. In 2014-15, Sustainability Skills courses enrolled 284 students. Green Mountain College’s total undergraduate population in 2014-2015 was 573, and even with some students take multiple courses in the curriculum in a given year, the engagement with our student body is significant.  It is too early to determine the impact of the certificate since it was put in place last fall. We continue to add to our list of such skills courses, with new courses in survey design and in non-violent communication slated for next fall.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/26/6/583/3271/GMC%20Innovation%20Credit%20Letter%20Pyles%202016.pdf,**,True,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,Resiliency,http://www.greenmtn.edu/academics/undergraduate/minors-and-certificates/sustainability-skills-certification/,--

Hampshire College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 09:58:42,bhooker@hampshire.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Intentionally Designed Endowment - a conference organized by Hampshire College,"Hampshire has a proud history of considering our values in managing our investments.  We were the first college to divest from South Africa back in the 70's, and have always accepted the proposition that as an educational organization we have an obligation to think about what we teach not only in what we profess, but in how we manage our campus, treat our employees, and invest our funds.  That led us to reassess our investment strategy several years ago, and to adopt a policy not of divesting, but of affirmatively investing in companies whose products and practices align with our values.  That is easily said, but most of our investments are in funds, and we pick advisors, not stocks, so we had to work to develop an approach with them.  Hard work, but quite doable.  There are many excellent advisors who will do that.  That meant we were mostly out of fossil fuels before the 350.org campaign. 
","Since we made those changes our endowment has out-performed its benchmarks, and has been above the average for comparable endowments, although the time has been so short that it doesn't prove anything yet.

Hampshire got so many questions about what it had done, and how it had managed the change, that the trustee who led the process of revising our policy suggested a conference, which we sponsored with the group Second Nature on April 3-4 in Cambridge,  MA.  It was called ""Intentionally Designed  Endowment: Aligning Your Investment Portfolio with Your Environmental, Social and Governance Goals.""  29 Colleges and universities were represented at the President, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or trustee level, along with a variety of foundations, non-profits, and family offices.  They were joined by a group of experts from SRI firms and investment advising offices.  We had three goals for the conference:  First, to establish that considering the risks of climate change and other sustainability issues is a legitimate and responsible topic of conversation for those managing endowments for mission driven non-profits;  Second, to make clear that there are many ways of addressing those risks;  and, third, to establish an on-going network and process to support the schools changing their investment strategies, and expand the number of schools doing so.

The scientific evidence that we are speeding down a path to catastrophic warming that will create massive suffering and foreclose options for future generations is compelling.  If we ignore urgent material evidence of risk of such magnitude we surely send a powerful message to our students about how we perceive science, and how we balance present comfort against future survival.  Changing investment policies is not the only way to respond to the threat of climate change, but should be considered in tandem by schools who are making significant investments to reduce emissions.

There is a large quantity of data to support the proposition that socially and environmentally responsible investing - including a fossil-free fund - yields returns that match or exceed those of the key indices. As we hoped, there will be a support network emerging from the conference.  Hampshire's Climate Justice League students are part of that network, specifically student Elizabeth Levinson, who attended the conference as is working now to envision a similar educational opportunity for students through coordinating a convergence for students on Hampshire's campus next year.  Daphne Change, Mount Holyoke student, and Stephen Treat, of UMass, also attended and are part of the network.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/713/6/583/3271/AASHE%20Investments%20innovation.pdf,**,--,--,True,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,http://www.hampshire.edu/offices/intentionally-designed-endowment-conference.htm,--

Hobart and William Smith Colleges,2016-03-18,2016-03-18 08:33:46,sustainability@hws.edu,2.0,Pursuing,"Parklets and Green Space in Geneva, N.Y.","Hobart and William Smith have continued locally-focused collaborations with Geneva, N.Y. to advance and promote innovative urban revitalization ideas and projects in the city’s downtown, contributing to the broader sustainability efforts being carried out by the HWS community.

During the past several years, the Colleges’ Department of Art and Architecture and the Sustainable Community Development (SCD) program introduced – through both curricular and public engagement efforts – “parklets” in locations across downtown Geneva. The parklets are extensions of the sidewalk, which use parking space(s) to provide additional outdoor and “green” space locations for pedestrians to stop, sit, rest, eat, drink, and/or take in art or some other amenity. The “parklets” served as a way to repurpose and invigorate downtown areas of Geneva, a small city located in the heart of the Finger Lakes, which like similar municipalities across the Rust Belt have faced struggles in keeping downtown spaces economically and culturally vibrant.

In spring 2013, a group of HWS students working on a SCD capstone project proposed installing the parklets in the city. Through research of best practices of other cities and urban spaces, they also proposed other creative urban renewal projects, including wall gardens, rain gardens, green roofs and outdoor amphitheaters. The students presented visual designs to demonstrate how stagnant areas could be revived into vibrant spaces for citizens and visitors.

Following the initial plan, two HWS students from the capstone course continued their efforts with Geneva as summer interns working for the newly established Geneva Neighborhood Resource Center (GNRC), a resource center of the City of Geneva Office of Neighborhood Initiatives. The interns developed a proposal for the introduction of “parklets” on a one-way street in downtown Geneva. Through parklets and other creative uses of urban spaces, the downtown was able to offer more green space and outdoor eating space, a way of attracting more residents and visitors to downtown businesses. 

Between 2014 and 2015, HWS furthered its involvement and leadership regarding local urban renewal with the formation of a unique collaboration. HWS Assistant Professor of Architectural Studies Gabriella D’Angelo worked with the Geneva Business Improvement District (BID), Geneva Area Chamber of Commerce, and City of Geneva to create a Parklet Competition for the City of Geneva. 

On May 1, 2015, the City announced the winners of the Parklet Competition in front of City Hall from a newly established parklet that was created as part of the competition. Two student groups from D’Angelo’s Architectural Studies course submitted winning designs and built two separate parklets in downtown Geneva. The parklets were constructed and then installed in front of two downtown businesses, offering outdoor seating for eating and drinking during warmer summer months. Due to their success, the City is considering a parklet ordinance through City Council and many Genevans and downtown businesses hope that the parklets will be installed during the summer annually going forward.

With limited green space and outside eating space in downtown Geneva, this collaborative initiative and competition brought together key City and downtown Geneva stakeholders to create innovative ideas for use of parking spaces. Through conception, proposal, competition, to installation, several HWS curricular programs have been involved in parklets and urban renewal efforts for downtown Geneva. In a small city like Geneva (population 13,261 according to U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census of Population), HWS classes, students, programs, and efforts are important to the vitality of the City and downtown. The installation of parklets in downtown Geneva is an example of creating innovative curricular applications to meet local needs.",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/495/6/583/3271/Parklets_LA_NA.pdf,**,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,True,--,--,--,--

pursue interdisciplinary and holistic solutions to sustainability challenges in a way that fosters cross functional integration of Penn State’s teaching, research, outreach, operation, and administration expertise, so that our university community can link and leverage our depth and build our collective capacity in pursuit of sustainability"".
This year the Fund awarded almost $750,000 to faculty/staff teams and about $100,000 to student teams located across the University's
colleges, campuses and administrative units. Resources for the Fund were ""contributed from all of Penn State's major functional units - Student Affairs, Undergraduate Education, Research, Outreach, and Finance and Business - and represent an institutional commitment to sustainability,"" according to Provost Nick Jones.
Three types of proposals were solicited:
• Development of new solutions to sustainability challenges
• Demonstration of measurable value that can be captured through the implementation of sustainability initiative and solutions
• Enhancement of learning across Penn State communities
The theme of the 2013 Reinvention Fund is ""Building the Living Laboratory"".
Examples of faculty/staff projects include:
• Community Solar on State - Create an outreach and educational platform that will allow our community to proceed with a pilot community PV project, capture the best practices learned, and enable prospective future solar projects.
• Making Penn State Athletics Events More Sustainable - Learn more about available ways to increase sustainability of athletics events, then put those solutions into place.
• Infusing Concepts of Sustainability throughout the Recreation, Parks and Tourism Management Curriculum.
Examples of student projects include:
• Affordable Greenhouse Venture Cameroon – Refine current affordable greenhouse technology in preparation for large-scale dissemination though a network of distribute micro-enterprises throughout West Africa.
• Pride Pantry – Create an on-campus food pantry for low-income students to overcome restrictions to students at the State College Area Food Bank.
• Remote Wind Power – Participate in the DOE’s Collegiate Wind Competition to design and build a portable wind energy generation system, including market research and financial analysis to support the viability of the product.


","At the proposal stage, each project was required to propose metrics by which its success would be measured. In addition, metrics are being developed to evaluate the success of the program as a whole.

In order to further our sustainability commitment and reduce our carbon footprint, Pomona College installed 6 electric vehicle charging stations on the main floor of the parking structure. Additionally, the electricity used to power the charging stations is offset through the installation of an 80.5 kW solar panel array. The charging stations have been expanded to include two charger ports per station, allowing for up to 12 EV’s to charge simultaneously. All of the stations are equipped with Level 2 charging capacity, which is faster than Level 1 stations. To encourage employee usage, all employees are eligible to receive free EV charging. To avoid supply shortages, users receive a text or email notification when charging is complete. It is our policy that the EV charging station parking spots are to be used only for EV’s currently charging. This program provides an indirect incentive to employees to purchase an electric vehicle, knowing that they can charge for free at work and increase the vehicle range.","Since the installation, the EV charging stations have charged vehicles over 3,000 times.

Dedicated to providing a meeting place where farmers could meet consumers, the market was a landmark and the inspiration for the growth of markets around the Houston area. In 2007, Rice University invited the Houston Farmers Market to move to the parking lot adjacent to the Rice Stadium on Rice’s campus. In August of 2010, after seven years as an independent, nonprofit organization, the Houston Farmers Market became an official Rice University entity and was appropriately renamed the Rice University Farmers Market. 

Throughout the years the goal of the market has remained the same: to make locally grown food available to as many consumers as possible, thereby providing a growing marketplace for local farmers and producers and a thriving meeting place for the community. Local farmers and small-business entrepreneurs, offering everything from environmentally safe bug repellent to soaps and lotions and organic meals for two, have become a regular fixture and a much-anticipated part of the Rice campus. Almost all of the food sold at the Rice University Farmers Market has been raised/grown sustainably, maintaining all the nutritional benefits without the health and environmental costs of artificial fertilizers and pesticides. 

Typically between 200 and 500 people visit the market each week. Rice faculty, staff and students are regular patrons, but the market also draws people of all ages from the Texas Medical Center and surrounding neighborhoods. 

Farmers from the market have become involved in Rice curriculum through participating in a food panel in the ENST 302 / SOCI 304 course each fall, as well as once-a-semester farm-to-fork dinners hosted by the student group Real Food Revolution.

Saint Louis University,2016-03-24,2016-03-24 17:17:24,bverhof1@slu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Student Led Initiative -Disposable Water Bottle Reduction Plan,"Over the summer of 2014, the Student Government Association (SGA) Wellness Committee submitted a proposal to reduce the total number of disposable water bottles purchased on campus by 50%.  The proposal included a plan to install 31 new water bottle filling stations across campus along with an engagement program.   
The use of plastic water bottles has been a growing concern raised by students and student organizations across the Saint Louis University campus.  This practice has proven to have large environmental risks and concerns both in production and waste.  For instance, it has been reported that 86% of all plastic water bottles, or around 30 billion, end up in a landfill every year in the U.S. The production of plastic water bottles also has social justice implications.  Often times, the privatization of water results in a net loss of resources for the surrounding communities in part of the world where local residence cannot afford the price of bottled water.  In order to address these concerns the SGA Wellness Committee created “The Water Fountain Initiative”. 
In order to significantly decrease bottle waste campus wide, the SGA Wellness Committee deemed it necessary to fund infrastructure needs to encourage the use of tap water.  This infrastructure improvement added 31 new filling stations in various locations at a cost of $70,000.  The locations were strategically selected by the SGA Wellness Committee based on convenience, accessibility to current water bottle fillers, and other high traffic areas.  
During the fall 2014 semester, reusable water bottles were purchased to provide students with the accessibility and promotion of the new water bottle filling stations scattered throughout campus.  Campus engagement activities occurred during Fall Welcome, new student orientation, and other campus activities.
In support of this initiative the University has added water bottle filling stations as a standard in all new building projects.

Its main objective is to change people’s mindsets towards their possessions and to kindle people’s enthusiasm for a sustainable society.

Sheridan became the first post-secondary Canadian institution to host Repair café in April 2014. It was organized by Wai Chu Cheng, Sustainability Coordinator at Sheridan who is also an active volunteer with Repair Café Toronto. The event was held at Sheridan’s Trafalgar Campus at Oakville and saw a healthy turnout comprising of students and faculty. The ‘fixers’ who helped repair items were mostly faculty/staff members with diverse skillsets.

The success of the first Repair Café at Sheridan encouraged the organizers to host another one in November 2014. Sheridan’s Davis Campus at Brampton was chosen as the venue this time around, thereby giving the students at the Davis campus a chance to participate. The event was a great success as 23 different items were fixed in a span of three hours. Items ranged from clothing to electronics to kitchen appliances.",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/336/6/583/3271/STARS%20Innovation%20Credit%20-%20Repair%20Cafe%20FINAL.pdf,**,--,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--

commute patterns and parking preferences at Stanford University. The goals are to reduce peak hour commuting, shift parking from congested lots to underutilized lots, and
improve wellness for Stanford commuters by encouraging walking and biking. The main
tools for inducing the behavior changes are monetary incentives paid out as lotteries
through games, cloud and mobile user interfaces, and social networking among the
commuters in Capri.","Each year Santa Clara County measures vehicle arrivals and departures on campus to see if the university is exceeding the maximum number of peak commute trips allowed under the General Use Permit. The numbers for Stanford had been rising for the past few years, but in Capri's first year the tide was stemmed and the university was one trip below the limit. Capri participants are seen to shift their commutes away from the morning and afternoon peak hours. The result from the first phase of the project was encouraging. The program had 2,993 participants signed up in its first year.

Capri launched two new features provided through a smartphone app called My Beats in
May 2013, which is available for iPhone and Android smartphones. The first feature
incentivizes commuters for biking or walking to campus to further reduce congestion on
campus. The second feature, called Walk'N’Talk, provides incentives for conducting

The willow plants preform an ecological engineering function, minimizing runoff from the site and preventing salts from entering into the local watershed and nearby Nine-Mile Creek and Onondaga Lake. The plant’s leaves, roots, and biological activity (transpiration) preform the same function as traditional cap and cover geomembrane systems, and the plant stems can be harvested regularly to produce woody biomass that can be used locally to produce renewable heat and power. This project is a unique partnership between numerous stakeholders in various sectors including ESF, Honeywell International, O’Brien and Gere (Environmental Engineering Firm), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and others.","The current size of this project covers over 100 acres of a former industrial site and there are plans to expand the project. Ongoing maintenance and monitoring of this site is conducted by ESF and partners. Plant growth and composition, and the water budget of the site, is monitored to confirm the effectiveness of the vegetative cap and quality of biomass feedstock. In November 2015, 30 acres of willow on this site was successfully harvested, producing thousands of tons of useable bioenergy feedstock. Numerous students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels are actively engaged with maintaining and studying this system, creating work-study and active, experiential learning opportunities in sustainable systems. Numerous graduate theses, dissertations and peer-reviewed journal articles have come from this work. A master’s thesis on this project in 2014 showed that on a life-cycle basis, this system produces about one tenth the greenhouse gas emissions at one tenth the financial cost of a traditional cap and cover geomembrane system. Willow is also a climate neutral fuel source, meaning that GHG emissions released in the production and use of the fuel are offset by ongoing above- and below-ground carbon sequestration.

State University of New York at Cortland,2015-10-09,2015-10-09 13:16:00,Beth.Klein@cortland.edu,2.0,Pursuing,100% Renewable Energy Credit purchased to offset electricity used from NON-renewable sources,"In the Fall of 2013, SUNY Cortland became the first institution in the 64-campus SUNY system to operate all of its facilities - classrooms, residence halls, dining areas, sports facilities … everything - using 100 percent renewable electrical energy.

“As one of the original signers of the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment, SUNY Cortland’s goal has been to create one of the greenest campuses in the nation,” College President Erik J. Bitterbaum said. “By taking this step, we’re showing that we’re willing to do more than just talk about energy sustainability.”

It’s part of a broader effort by SUNY to use the resources of its campus network to encourage clean energy innovation and cost-effective and sustainable energy use. SUNY Cortland’s commitment to energy sustainability is a demonstration of how SUNY is helping to foster a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable future for New York state,"" said SUNY Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher. ""Congratulations to President Bitterbaum and the faculty, staff and students at SUNY Cortland who have made this outstanding achievement possible. This is a terrific example of SUNY meeting its strategic planning goal of contributing to an energy-smart New York.""

 “If we say that we believe global warming is a real concern, and the technology is available today to help prevent it, then even if you have to spend a little more, you do what needs to be done,” said Timothy Slack, SUNY Cortland’s physical plant director (retired). “You have to walk the talk.”

Currently, about a third of the electricity provided by National Grid to the campus comes from renewable sources, Slack said. Since the initial costs for establishing alternative power sources like windmills or hydroelectric plants are high compared with existing fossil-fuel sources, a system of credits has been developed to allow power customers to pay more to encourage the establishment and use of renewable energy.

Although electricity from all sources is combined on the power grid, the program diverts the premium paid for renewable energy credits to help sustainable energy producers. Eventually, as technology improves and renewable energy becomes more common, the cost is expected to come down.  

The cost of buying an estimated 16 million kilowatt-hours of renewable electricity every year will be offset largely by the new energy generated by the solar installations on campus and ongoing energy efficiency efforts, Slack said. Both initiatives are part of SUNY Cortland’s long-term commitment to sustainability. 

Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently approved the ambitious, $3 million solar energy project for SUNY Cortland as part of a unique initiative designed to increase the number of solar installations throughout New York.  The College is one of 79 project sites that will benefit from the latest round of awards by NY-Sun, a solar energy program run by the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority.  ","Campus has reduced carbon footprint on electric usage to zero, helping to promote renewable power generation with the investment through Renewable Energy Credits.   A portion of the RECs are within the northeast electricity grid, providing direct investment in the sustainability of the power grid for the northeast, and New York State specifically.

All buildings on campus greater than 2,000 square feet are submetered for electricity (36 buildings).  The main electric meter providing electricity to the vast majority of the campus has its own separate meter.  All buildings on campus greater than 5,000 square feet are submetered for domestic water (36 buildings).  All non-residential buildings connected to the campus’s high temperature hot water (HTHW) system are metered (19 buildings).  Two residence halls, LeFevre Hall and Crispell Hall are metered for high temperature hot water.  The remaining residence halls are being submetered for HTHW as they are renovated or constructed.  Over half of buildings on campus are metered for natural gas.  The Central Heating Plant, by far the greatest user of natural gas, is submetered for natural gas.

Facilities managers across the country are beginning to adopt building-level submeters for utilities.  SUNY New Paltz's submetering program and energy management practices are innovative because:

(1) The extent of our submeters.  Many facilities just have electric submeters, whereas we have the full range of electric, natural gas, high temp hot water, and domestic water.  

(2) The investment we have made in ensuring meter data accuracy.  Many facilities have submeters but do not have confidence in the quality of the metering data, limiting the usefulness of the entire submetering system.  SUNY New Paltz rigorously evaluates meter data quality to ensure that it is accurate and usful.  

(3) The extent to which we incorporate utility trend data into energy monitoring, metering, and planning.  SUNY New Paltz tracks building-level demand data to evaluate HVAC systems and building scheduling.  We incorporate actual utility trend data into long-term energy planning through our Energy Master Plan.  We incorporate the meter data in our Monitoring-Based Commissioning Plan focusing on 22 academic, administrative, and athletic buildings.   We evaluate the effectiveness of our winter session setback program and demand response program with meter data.  We use the data to evaluate construction projects including comparing the energy usage of: 
* New LEED Gold residence halls vs. unrenovated residence halls
* Air conditioned residence halls vs. un-air conditioned residence halls
* LEED Silver academic buildings vs. pre-LEED academic buildings
* Existing buildings vs. prospective net zero energy buildings.","* The Offices of Campus Sustainability, Facilities Operations, and Design and Construction, as well as our contractors, more effectively manage energy use because the campus has building-level real time and historical energy data.
* Actual meter data has been used to analyze building source energy use in the campus's Energy Master Plan, rather than engineering calculations.
* The Office of Campus Sustainability developed a building-level monitoring-based commissioning program with Siemens.
* The Office of Campus Sustainability has sought to improve energy efficiency of two similar residence halls, both designed to meet LEED Gold certification, that have very different energy use patterns.
* The Office of Campus Sustainability tracks its energy conservation performance during Winter Session Setback with our building-level utility data.
* The Office of Campus Sustainability, with the Office of Design and Construction, has established energy consumption reduction goals for Coykendall Science Building to guide a retrocommissioning study, HVAC upgrades, and a chiller replacement.  Coykendall, a science laboratory building, is second highest energy consuming building at SUNY New Paltz.

The revenue from the sales of the bicycles is used to improve bike amenities and programs on campus. 

Throughout the year, Campus Safety collects, removes and stores bicycles that have been locked illegally to ADA ramps, fire exits and other important points of access. If unregistered, Campus Safety will tag the bicycles and hold them for a minimum of one year. In addition, the Grounds Department monitors bicycles left on campus and removes them from racks when the bicycles have become a target of theft (e.g., wheels are missing).

CPS is guided by the principle that public service rooted in an academic context contributes to the development of student civic engagement. 

The first tier of the Public Service Graduation Requirement involves the implementation of Service Learning Courses, academic courses with an added service learning component. Every undergraduate department and major offers courses that include a public service project that relates to and enhances the learning done in the classroom. The students are placed at numerous sites throughout the greater New Orleans area for a variety of projects, and spend 20 or 40 hours (depending on the class) completing their service throughout the semester. To complete this first-tier requirement, students must successfully complete one service learning course (at the 1000 – 3000 level) no later than the fifth semester of full-time enrollment at Tulane.

The second tier of the Public Service Graduation Requirement may only be completed once the student has attained sophomore standing and has completed the first-tier service learning course. To satisfy the second tier, students must participate in one of the following programs: a second service learning course at the 3000 level or above, an academic service learning internship, a faculty-sponsored public service research project, a public service honors thesis project, a public service-based international study abroad program, or a capstone experience with a public service component. 

Academic Service Learning is an educational experience based upon a collaborative partnership between the university and the community. “Learning by doing” enables students to apply academic knowledge and critical thinking skills to meet genuine community needs. Through reflection and assessment, students gain deeper understanding of course content and the importance of civic engagement.

A year's worth of stakeholder engagement (by specifically holding focus groups, performing marketing analysis, interviews and broad outreach to the business community) led to the launch of the Western New York Sustainable Business Roundtable on Earth Day 2014.  Over the past year membership has grown to nearly 50 businesses (from large multi-national companies to smaller businesses across a diverse group of sectors) with active engagement occuring throughout the month with numerous workshops, communication groups and on-line tools. 

The Round table has been gaining momentum since it's launch with the awarding of a  US Environmental Protection Agency Region 2 grant that has provided full time staffing to the organization as it works to foster collaborations that enable member businesses to act on their sustainability goals, maintain profitability, and promote a healthy community.

While the University was pivotal to the creation of the Roundtable by quarterbacking the stakeholder engagement process it has also played a continuing leadership role on the Board and hosting the annual congress and many workshops.

University of British Columbia,2016-02-22,2016-02-22 18:18:36,charlene.ponto@ubc.ca,2.0,Pursuing,Utilizing Behaviour and Psychology Research to Advance Campus and Regional Waste Reduction Objectives,"Researchers at the UBC Brain and Attention Research (BAR) Lab in the Department of Psychology have conducted a series of innovative research projects that have been used to help support the development and implementation of UBC’s Zero Waste Action Plan and have also contributed to waste reduction programs outside of UBC, including at other universities, Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation sites, and municipalities within the Metro Vancouver region. 

In these projects, psychology research has been applied to pro-environmental behaviors, with the goal of not only increasing our understanding of human behavior, decision-making, and motivation, but also informing design of waste reduction and recycling plans, policies and infrastructure. Research methods including naturalistic observation, in-lab behavioural studies, Optitrak infrared technology, and real world measurement have been used to gain insight into the barriers to optimal recycling behavior and how these barriers can be overcome.  

In a research collaboration with Metro Vancouver, optical technology was used to track subjects’ movements in 3D space to test responses to recycling signage. The study confirmed that simple graphic icons required the least cognitive effort, resulting in more materials being placed in the correct recycling stream and fewer test subjects placing recyclable materials in the garbage. It was found that in subjects for whom English is a second language, accuracy was lower with word signs and response time was slowest, even though subjects rated the word signs as their preference – particularly important in a city where many people may not have English as their first language. There was also evidence that “yes” messaging was more effective than “no” messaging on signs and that with “yes” messaging, icons were more effective than pictures. It was also found that there is a clear response time and efficiency benefit when the ordering of recycling bins and signs is consistent and reliable. 

In another collaborative study between UBC Sustainability & Engineering and the BAR Lab, waste produced by over 1,000 student residents at UBC’s Walter Gage high-rise student residences was weighed for 10 weeks. The data clearly showed that the level of convenience, in terms of proximity of recycling stations to residential units, plays a dominant role in recycling rates. When convenience was maximized, recycling rates were increased up to 6-7 times compared to control groups. Increases in recycling were also replicated in a residential building outside of UBC. 

These research studies used innovative research methods and utilized a behaviour and psychology based approach to addressing waste reduction objectives. Many elements of the studies brought together researchers with UBC planning, operations, and student housing staff, creating living laboratory projects and engaging students in real-world research. It also brought together local government and researchers to address regional waste reduction goals. 
","The results of these research studies played an important part in developing UBC’s campus-wide Sort It Out program communications materials and signage, which is being implemented across UBC as part of the comprehensive rollout of UBC’s Zero Waste Action Plan. 

In two UBC buildings that installed the new recycling stations and signage to replace stand-alone garbage cans in the first phase of the rollout, diversion rates increased dramatically from 18 to 48 per cent in the Walter Koerner Library, and 35 to 61 per cent in the Geography building in the first two weeks. Subsequently, the new signage designs have been incorporated in over 200 multi-stream recycling stations installed across campus, and will be further rolled out to an estimated 600 total stations by fall 2015. 

The results of the Walter Gage residence pilot project are also being utilized in the design of new student housing residences on campus to provide recycling facilities that are more conveniently located on each floor, such as at Orchard Commons, which will add more than 1,000 student beds and mixed use academic, office and retail space. 

The results of these collaborative research projects have been shared with other universities and municipalities and in turn informed institutional and municipal recycling programs and signage. Simon Fraser University has incorporated elements of UBC’s signage design into their own campus-wide recycling station rollout. Results of the Metro Vancouver collaboration played an important role in municipal recycling program development and informed the development of signage resources which have been provided to the 21 member municipalities of the region for use in their programs and posted to the Metro Vancouver website.

The Office of Sustainability and Energy worked in a collaborative, competitive procurement strategy with 19 other public agencies in the region, led by the Alameda County General Services division, Berkeley secured very favorable pricing for these three rooftop and one canopy/carport installations – 25-40% below market rate.  In aggregate these systems will bring cost savings in year one to the campus.  The solar will be installed by a purchase power agreement (PPA) - the vendor is covering the costs of installation and operating and maintaining the systems, and Berkeley will pay for the power they generate.  

    The rooftop solar panels on MLK Student Union replace (and expand) an older less productive system. The solar array on new the Eshleman Hall will add even more green power to the Lower Sproul complex.  Together these two systems will produce 150,000 kWh solar electricity for the buildings.

    Recreation Sports large field house roof offers space for an array that will produce 340,000 kWh of solar power, providing close to one-third of the buildings electricity needs.

    The University Village carport solar system will produce 700,000 kWh of carbon-free solar electricity each year, providing 20% of the power needs of the village.

These sites were selected because they meet the physical requirements for solar power and because the stakeholders, including student users of the facilities, showed interest in solar power. 

Students have had a keen interest in making these solar projects a reality. The R-REP solar installations were supported by a grant from The Green Initiative Fund  in 2013. This grant helped provide initial investment and campus support for UC Berkeley to enter the R-REP program, allowing the campus to pursue solar installations. Furthermore, the TGIF grant funds a student engagement component so that these installations align with UC Berkeley's focus on research and teaching. TGIF was founded with the intention of bringing more clean energy to UC Berkeley, so TGIF is fulfilling one of its major goals through this project.  

There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to bring solar power under a power purchase agreement to the UC Berkeley campus.  The Office of Sustainability and Energy has been at the forefront of this effort – bringing the R-REP program to the attention of the campus, coordinating the vendor selections and contracting, working with the campus partners to scope their projects, and ensuring cost effective and technically sound solar PV will operate on the campus for the next 25 years. However, this project would not have been possible without an extensive collaborative effort between many departments and groups across campus.

The premise of “norm communication” is that individuals are more likely to adopt a new practice or behavior if they believe that most of their peers are doing the same. Simply communicating the behavior of others has proven effective at changing behaviors in energy and water conservation in previous research. The current work was the first to systematically test the effect of norm communication on food scrap separation behavior. When the new norms of separation are communicated directly, residents increase participation, policy support, and the belief that separating food waste is the right thing to do. Moreover, participants were significantly more likely to continue separating food waste over time if they received the norm communication. As more cities establish organics recycling programs to meet state mandates for landfill diversion and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, incorporating these tools from the social sciences will increase efficacy with little to no increased cost.","With funding from the Costa Mesa Sanitary District (CMSD), UCI, and external grants, Geislar conducted a community-based experiment with 1,035 households for six months from June to December 2015. Three months after the implementation of the curbside organics collection program, Geislar began the intervention to determine whether communicating the new social norms around food waste could improve participation beyond the original program design. The study showed that participation among residents receiving norm communication significantly increased from 66 percent to 77 percent, while no change occurred for residents with no norm communication. This effect is robust across gender, education, and environmental attitudes. 

This research fulfills a recent Executive Order from President Obama calling for the use of behavioral sciences to improve policy efficacy. CMSD was the first in the county with a curbside organics recycling program, and this research is the first to test the use of norm communication to improve participation in these programs. The results of the partnership between Geislar and CMSD are serving as an innovative model for other cities to incorporate behavioral sciences into their organics collection programs across the state.

This work had always been outsourced to a service provider skilled in maintaining high-purity water systems.  To produce 7.0 MM gallons per year of high-purity water required 24 MM gallons per year of tap water and $400,000 per year in preventive maintenance services.

UCLA proposed a strategy to shift the preventive maintenance services to in-house mechanics backed by an independent water consultant.  The goal of this strategy was to:

A)	Save water through improved maintenance practices
B)	Improve documentation that water quality standards were being achieved
C)	Reduce preventive maintenance cost through process optimization and standardization

Goal achievement was measured by the following key performance indicators:
1)	High-purity water quality conformance to end-user standards
2)	Water waste per 1000 gallons of high-purity water produced

"University of California, Santa Barbara",2016-03-23,2016-03-23 16:14:33,mo@geog.ucsb.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Optimizing waste management services through stakeholder engagement,"In an effort to improve waste management practices and decrease the workload required from custodial staff to service the indoor waste infrastructure, an innovative approach was taken by the Associate Director of Facilities Management, the Custodial Superintendent, and the Refuse & Recycling Manager. They began a pilot program to walk the indoor square footage of 10 buildings with the respective custodian for that route. With the majority of the custodians at UCSB on campus in the early morning, walkthroughs occurred on Friday mornings from 4am-8am for 10 weeks. With the guidance of the custodial staff, underutilized and outdated containers were removed, and new containers with signage (stickers) informing users of acceptable items in that waste stream and the service schedule for that bin were added. In an additional effort to assist the custodial staff, the existing custodial carts were replaced with carts that provided separate receptacles for landfill and recycling waste. The custodians were also provided with blue liners for the recycling waste stream to help them differentiate between the two waste streams when disposing of waste; blue liners in the blue recycling dumpsters; and black liners in the tan dumpsters. At the end of each walkthrough, all waste receptacles in the building were mapped, and using the building floor plans, copies were provided to the custodian, the custodial lead for the area, as well as the building managers. This integrated and comprehensive approach to improving waste management and custodial service also resulted in invaluable face time with the custodial staff and allowed them provide important feedback on more than waste services. While this program touched on environmental sustainability, it also targeted social and economical sustainability issues. 
","At UCSB, building waste audits indicate that approximately 20% of the landfill bins are composed of recyclable material, likely due to the fact that there is not one-to-one pairing of landfill and recycling bins on campus; this percentage tends to increase in lab buildings. Using the front-end loader scale data from our waste hauler, approximately 150 tons of landfill waste was generated this past year from the 10 buildings in the pilot. Given that 20% of the landfill waste stream is contaminated with recyclables, we believe that our efforts to reduce the amount of landfill bins and introduce additional recycling bins and signage will increase the probability of individuals disposing of their recyclables in recycling receptacles in the 10 pilot buildings, resulting in a decrease in contamination of 12%, or 18 tons. 
In addition to the improvement in waste management efforts, this program also led to quantitative benefits that may not be traditionally recorded. From the 10 buildings participating in the program, 352 landfill receptacles were removed. Of the 352 receptacles, 67 were large (23gal+) and 285 were around 10gal. With large receptacles serviced on a daily basis, and small receptacles serviced on average 2x/ week, it is estimated that, 47,060 liners will be saved, amounting to 876 lbs. It was also determined that it takes on average 0.30 minutes to service a trash can; therefore, removing the aforementioned number of bins resulted in reducing the time to service waste receptacles in these buildings by 393 hours/yr. 

UCSB will save approximately $1,476 in landfill hauling charges and will actually receive $450 for the recycled material. In addition, with over 47,060 liners projected to be saved annually as part of the pilot project, it is estimated that over $8,000 will be saved. While the estimated 393 hours/yr the custodians will save in servicing receptacles does not have a direct financial savings, it will allow them to spend more time sanitizing and cleaning other areas of the building, as well as reduce the likelihood of work injuries related to waste services.
In all, this project should yield a cost savings of $9,926/ year and save the custodial staff 393 hours in servicing waste receptacles.

•	Labor cost reductions as collection operations switch to an on-demand service model.
•	More accurate service charges, where departments and buildings are billed for the true, weight-based cost of collecting materials generated rather than the less accurate, industry -standard volumetric, static pickup method. This also helps campus users reduce the total amount of waste and recycling materials generated.
•	More accurate monthly reporting on each individual department or building’s progress towards attaining campus-wide zero-waste goals.
•	The ability to free up labor for complementary activities such as UCSC’s new on-campus composting operation, which employs existing personnel.
•	A resulting agency budget model that embraces the economics of conservation, where operations do not suffer catastrophic losses as users reduce their ""unsustainable"" activities.

University of Colorado Boulder,2016-03-03,2016-03-03 07:49:58,dave.newport@colorado.edu,2.0,Pursuing,"Energy, water, chemical-use, and cost reduction activities in research laboratories","Two innovative practices implemented in CU Boulder research laboratories have been developed by the CU Green Labs Program in cooperation with the researchers themselves and related campus units. Together they are part of an array of innovative practices pioneered by the CU Green Labs Program, a partnership between CU Facilities Management and the CU Environmental Center. The innovative program activities included in this credit are:

1)	ETHANOL REUSE: Re-Use of Cold Trap Ethanol to Sterilize Cell Culture BioSafety Cabinets.  The Stable Isotope Lab at the Institute for Alpine and Arctic Research (INSTAAR) uses ethanol cold traps during its analysis of ice core samples.  Over time, water from the air humidifies the ethanol.  As the water concentration increases in the ethanol solution, ice crystals begin to form in the cold trap rendering the solution useless to the lab.  Because of the strong interaction between ethanol and water, distilling the used ethanol is energy intense and does not remove sufficient water from the ethanol to be of real benefit to the lab.  Since this diluted ethanol is clean, the lab wanted to know if there was a way in which the ethanol could be re-used instead of having to discard the ethanol as hazardous waste which they did for many, many years.

At a meeting between Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) and the CU Green Labs Program, the group developed the idea of re-using the ethanol at the Biochemistry Cell Culture Facility.  In cell culture, ethanol is readily used to sterilize biosafety cabinets and other items, but it is first diluted down with water to 70% ethanol.   Since the ethanol leaving the cold traps was on the order of ~85-90% ethanol, it could easily be diluted to 70% ethanol for re-use in cell culture. 
 
2)   ELECTRON MICROSCOPE POWER DOWN PRACTICE: Turning off a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) When Not in Use for Significant Energy and Water Savings.  Electron microscopes require vacuum conditions to be maintained for instrument integrity and performance.  As a result, electron microscopes, their vacuum pumps, and associated chillers remain on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   Some instruments do come with a standby mode that enables the high vacuum pumps and associated chillers to be shut off, leaving some microscope components on such as the low vacuum pumps on, but most scope facilities choose not to use the standby mode because they are concerned it will affect the performance of their instruments.  Some electron microscopes do not come with standby mode option at all, including a scanning electron microscope in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EBio) Department at CU-Boulder.   This scope is infrequently used by the department but is an instrument which the department wishes to keep.  The scope and the chiller use ~78 kWh/day in electricity and likely on the order of ~500 gallons/day of tap water when left on all the time (processed chilled water is not available in that building).

A lab member who was bothered by the constant sound of the tap water going down the drain asked whether this equipment could be turned off when not in use since it was infrequently used by the department.  CU-Boulder Green Labs reached out to the manufacturer, JEOL, to see what was possible.  The request was an unusual one for JEOL, but JEOL was open to the idea.  They reported that while most electron microscopes cannot be turned off regularly, this particular model could as long as the scope was turned back on at least every two weeks to maintain the vacuum in the chamber of the instrument.  ","ETHANOL REUSE
1) Ethanol re-use has been in effect now at CU-Boulder for 1. 5 years with ~120 gallons of ethanol/year being diverted from hazardous waste and being re-used in Biochemistry cell culture, saving the cell culture facility ~$1500/yr in avoided ethanol purchasing costs.  The ethanol is transported between the two INSTAAR & Biochemistry Cell Culture labs by CU-Boulder EH&S.   
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE POWER DOWN PRACTICE
2) For no more than two years now, the Stock Lab in EBio has been keeping this instrument off when not in use and making sure it was turned back on briefly at least every two weeks to maintain vacuum in the instrument chamber.   It is avoiding an estimated ~28,000 kWh/year in electricity use and ~180,000 gallons/year in tap water use.   Considering that putting electron microscopes in standby mode is uncommon for those instruments that have that option, turning an entire electron microscope completely off when not in use is an exceptional act that is simply not done in this field of work to the best of our knowledge.

We must begin to teach “Applied Sustainability.”
Increasingly some of our courses are tying their curriculum to actual funding opportunities. 
The UCCS Green Action Fund (GAF) is supplied by a five dollar per semester fee and directed by students. Classes including Sustainable Me, Sustainability Capstone, Changing Places, and others are connecting  curricula with opportunities for projects. These projects involve students in many learning opportunities including grant proposal, budgeting, utility rebates, project management, evaluating products and life cycle analysis, communication, and education.
 To date, students from several different classes have completed showerhead, aerator, toilet, and lighting retrofits in housing, and completed pilot studies on air dryers, all funded by GAF.  Mechanical Engineering students are developing a charging station for cell phones using a stationary bicycle. This model of linking academic coursework with designated funding enables more meaningful experiences for students and provides economic benefits to the university that might not otherwise take place. ","There have been a number of successful outcomes over the last three years. Over 200 toilets with 3.5 gallons per flush were exchanged with 1.28 gpf in student housing. The same number of showerheads were replaced with high efficiency models. Vanity lights in housing were changed from incandescent to compact fluorescent. Several additions were made to the campus garden that provides food to dining services, include high tunnels, a vegetable washing station, and a vermicomposting system. Students from one class decided to invest in infrastructure/racks for long boards to encourage alternative transportation.

University of Connecticut,2016-03-25,2016-03-25 18:14:59,rich.miller@uconn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Expansion of the Hillside Environmental Education Park,"With the design and construction of the new roadway that serves as a main entrance into the University, priority was given to protecting the land surrounding a high quality wetland habitat.  In addition to the many amphibian and wildlife friendly features incorporated into the roadway design, 101 acres of land was placed into conservation thereby expanding the existing 64 acres of conservation land known as the Hillside Environmental Education Park (HEEP). The HEEP is an outdoor classroom made up of land surrounding a former landfill that the University remediated, capped and protected through a conservation effort.  The HEEP originally comprised of 33 acres of wetlands and 31 acres of uplands as well as rehabilitated wetlands and woodlands. The 101 acre expansion results in 165 acres of protected wildlife areas including wetlands, vernal pools, and riparian zones. 

Even in the very beginning planning stages, the University evaluated eight different road design alternatives to ensure the least impact on the surrounding wetland and riparian areas.  Additionally, there is a low salt zone along part of the road that traverses areas which are sensitive to chemical changes induced by the addition of salts.  Furthermore, the LED lights installed as part of this project direct the light along the roadway, minimizing the light pollution in the wetland areas that might otherwise affect amphibian migratory and mating patterns.

Especially innovative in the road planning process was the design and development of three wildlife corridors beneath the road.  After identifying the species most vulnerable to the changes incurred by the construction project, most of which were found to be amphibians, road designers and other professionals monitored the paths most often used by the wildlife in order to inform their crossing designs and locations.

Of the three bridges that were designed as wildlife crossings, two are 78-foot bridges with 40-foot culverts, and are large enough for other wildlife, such as deer, to pass safely from one side of the road to the other.  The bridges, themselves, have extended wing walls and work in conjunction with other plastic barriers designed to guide the animals under, rather than over the road.  Gently sloped Cape Cod curbs were also employed in the design so that if amphibians or other small animals do get into the road, they are easily able to climb out.
","Both the federal government and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Both the Federal government and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection require that the University monitor the wetlands for five years, at a minimum, after project completion to ensure the continued health and stability of the wetland systems and the wildlife in the area. The health of the wetlands will be evaluated based on the annual plant and animal population levels.
As part of the wetland monitoring, the University will also perform vernal pool surveys with the first survey performed during the spring of 2014 prior to the construction start.  The spring 2015 vernal pool survey occurred during road construction activities.  The findings of the 2015 survey were consistent with the 2014 Pre-Construction Vernal Pool Survey.  The vernal pools must continue to support breeding populations of amphibians within the normal range for these specific habitats.

In essence, sustainability courses address interconnections between economy, society, and environment.  To foster the connections, the University Libraries, the Provost’s Office, Sustainable UMass, and the Center for Teaching and Faculty Development all collaborate in providing this resource for faculty.

The program is supported currently by the Libraries Sustainability Fund.  Tenured faculty, tenure-track faculty, full-time contract faculty, part-time faculty are all eligible to apply for the program, which includes a $1,000 mini-grant to assist in curriculum development and release time.  Faculty are asked to participate in monthly SCI Faculty Fellows meetings scheduled throughout the academic year to share ideas and learn about each other's curriculum development, as well as hear about what sustainability programming is available to them and their students on campus.

Priority is given to faculty proposals which address either one or both:
The Climate Action Plan (CAP) for UMass Amherst. This document  identifies goals in operations, finance, and engagement, and metrics for measuring progress of sustainability at UMass.

AND/OR: 

The reporting of STARS (Sustainability tracking Assessment & Rating System) for the UMass Amherst campus. This transparent, self-reporting framework is used by colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance.

AND/OR:

Integrate proposal writing assignments geared towards developing proposals for the Sustaianability, Innovation, & Engagement Fund.

Faculty are given examples of how a course might integrate the CAP or STARS into sustainability courses, such as:

•  Integrate critical analysis of the CAP into assignments, to challenge students and identify key areas not yet addressed.

•  Assign a research project that addresses a specific STARS credit for UMass advancement.

Once faculty begin the program, Campus Sustainability Manager, Ezra Small is available to assist with the design of projects, papers and assignments based on the CAP or STARS, and provide guest lectures to their courses.

In addition to the sustainability focus of the program, the faculty are also encouraged to integrate one or more licensed library databases into a course assignment(s).

They often require innovations that integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines, including the social sciences, natural sciences, and policy fields. Yet, establishing lines of communication among scientists, practitioners, and policymakers in different disciplines can be challenging, as they may use very different frameworks and terminologies. The Michigan Journal of Sustainability aims to foster transdisciplinary communication by publishing timely, innovative, stimulating, and informative articles that translate scholarly research on systemic sustainability problems into useful formats for practitioners and policy makers. The Journal focuses on three areas: (1) sustainable freshwater systems, (2) livable communities, and (3) responses to climate variability and change. We encourage submissions that address these research areas, both locally and globally, as well as projects that bridge them. The Journal is designed to appeal to readers from a broad range of specialties and backgrounds, and papers are edited to be comprehensible to those reading outside of their own area of expertise. Founded and overseen by University of Michigan graduate students, the Journal is sponsored by the Graham Sustainability Institute at the University of Michigan. Peer Review Process and Open Access Policy: Manuscripts submitted to the Journal undergo a double-blind review process. They are read by an infield reviewer, an out-of-field reviewer, and a member of the Editorial board for accuracy, quality, and relevance to the Journal’s focus. In addition, articles are rated in three areas to determine acceptance: (1) potential for idea transfer and development across fields; (2) immediate use for practitioners and policy makers; and (3) clarity and readiness for print. The Journal provides open access to all content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports a greater global exchange of knowledge.

SAP is a place-based 'land lab' comprised of fifteen acres at UMD's Research and Field Studies Center (formerly the Northeast Agricultural Experimental Station). We manage a five acre trial seedling apple orchard and a ten acre organic (transition) farm; we also work on a variety of food and agriculture projects in the region. SAP@UMD is guided by an interdisciplinary faculty collaborative in its activities, which fall into three areas: building a platform for experiential learning in sustainable agriculture for faculty, students, and community members; as a vehicle for collaborating on food systems change within the University of Minnesota, Duluth; and as a vehicle for bringing resources into the community and region around sustainable agriculture and community food systems.

SAP@UMD is dedicated to bringing classroom and experiential learning around food, agriculture and gardening issues and activities. Courses in Geography, Environmental Studies, and Anthropology will be integrated into operating the market garden and heritage apple orchard. Please contact us if you are interested in any of these activities within the classroom, internships and volunteer opportunities.

We developed a ten acre field at the Field and Research Studies Center (a.k.a. the UMD Farm). This field site, the former Northeast Experimental Station, has been abandoned since 1976 (see History tab on this website). This field site gives students hand's on opportunity to plan, grow and market food.

A partnership with UMD Dining Services gives us a place to sell the produce we grow and UMD Dining has used this produce to rebuild their own capacity to use whole foods in their kitchens as a step toward procuring greater amounts from area farmers. The partnership with Dining Services has a twofold function: to provide experiential education opportunities to students in production, distribution and processing of local foods and scratch cooking; and to assist the Dining Services in iterating their own operations to broader scratch cooking from locally harvested produce.","More than a thousand students annually actively participate in the experiential learning activities. 

UMD’s Dining Services supports the personnel needs associated with the farm and purchases the organically grown produce (more than 20,000 pounds in 2015) which is served on campus, creating a systems-change vehicle linking academics and operations for mutual benefit.  

Taken as a whole, SAP creates an integrative structure for social and institutional learning related to how to devise, model and disseminate ways that human systems can better interface with earth systems at a regional scale.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/112/6/583/3271/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-17%20at%2010.15.42%20PM.png,**,True,True,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,http://www.d.umn.edu/cscd/sap/main/index.php,--

University of Missouri,2015-05-01,2015-05-01 15:33:57,raghavans@missouri.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Fracking Chemicals Disrupt Hormone Function,"University of Missouri researchers have found greater hormone-disrupting properties in water located near hydraulic fracturing drilling sites than in areas without drilling. The researchers also found that 11 chemicals commonly used in the controversial ""fracking"" method of drilling for oil and natural gas are endocrine disruptors.

Endocrine disruptors interfere with the body's endocrine system, which controls numerous body functions with hormones such as the female hormone estrogen and the male hormone androgen. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as those studied in the MU research, has been linked by other research to cancer, birth defects and infertility.","The study, ""Estrogen and Androgen Receptor Activities of Hydraulic Fracturing Chemicals and Surface and Ground Water in a Drilling-Dense Region,"" was published in the journal Endocrinology.

""More than 700 chemicals are used in the fracking process, and many of them disturb hormone function,"" said Susan Nagel, PhD, associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the MU School of Medicine. ""With fracking on the rise, populations may face greater health risks from increased endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure.""

The study involved two parts. The research team performed laboratory tests of 12 suspected or known endocrine-disrupting chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and measured the chemicals' ability to mimic or block the effects of the reproductive sex hormones estrogen and androgen. They found that 11 chemicals blocked estrogen hormones, 10 blocked androgen hormones and one mimicked estrogen.

The researchers also collected samples of ground and surface water from several sites, including:

Accident sites in Garfield County, Colo., where hydraulic fracturing fluids had been spilled
Nearby portions of the Colorado River, the major drainage source for the region
Other parts of Garfield County, Colo., where there had been little drilling
Parts of Boone County, Mo., which had experienced no natural gas drilling
The water samples from drilling sites demonstrated higher endocrine-disrupting activity that could interfere with the body's response to androgen and estrogen hormones. Drilling site water samples had moderate-to-high levels of endocrine-disrupting activity, and samples from the Colorado River showed moderate levels. In comparison, the researchers measured low levels of endocrine-disrupting activity in the Garfield County, Colo., sites that experienced little drilling and the Boone County, Mo., sites with no drilling.

""Fracking is exempt from federal regulations to protect water quality, but spills associated with natural gas drilling can contaminate surface, ground and drinking water,"" Nagel said. ""We found more endocrine-disrupting activity in the water close to drilling locations that had experienced spills than at control sites. This could raise the risk of reproductive, metabolic, neurological and other diseases, especially in children who are exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals.""

•	Strengthening the culture of innovation at UNC
•	Providing courses and resources that support aspiring entrepreneurs","Notable progress to date includes an increase in entrepreneurial studies and multiple new incubators and venture competitions.

STUDIES

Minor in Entrepreneurship
The minor in entrepreneurship is an interdisciplinary program housed in the economics department. The minor equips students with the skills needed to launch successful ventures in social, commercial, sports, scientific, and artistic endeavors. Last year 300 students applied for 100 spots. Professor Jim Johnson leads the social entrepreneurship track and focuses on ventures with positive impacts and benefits to primarily under-served communities.

To expose more students to the principles of innovation an Introduction to Entrepreneurship (ECON 125) class was taught for the first time in fall 2012. Instructors included former Chancellor Holden Thorp, Entrepreneur-in-Residence Buck Goldstein, and former economics Chair John Akin. The course attracted 300 students who heard from a wide variety of prominent risk takers. As part of the class, student teams developed ideas for business start-ups and the top four projects were recognized during the final class. The leading vote getter was RecomPence, a venture that would allow students to donate small amounts of money to their favorite charity each time they swiped their UNC One Cards.

Center for Entrepreneurial Studies 
Since 1997, the Kenan-Flagler Business School ‘s Center for Entrepreneurial Studies has offered resources and mentors to students, staff, and faculty in one of the nation's most vibrant entrepreneurial hotspots, Research Triangle Park. More than 20 MBA electives incorporate aspects of entrepreneurship. For non-business students, a networking and workshop series introduces the concepts of venture capital and business planning.

Launch the Venture
Launch the Venture is a series of three, half-semester modules providing intensive assistance to teams of budding entrepreneurs. Accepted student, staff, or faculty teams analyze the feasibility of their ideas and develop pitching, networking, and team-building skills. In the second segment, teams create their business model, develop a marketing and sales strategy, and formulate implementation and management plans. If the plan is deemed good enough, the team is invited to enroll in the third module on financing. Funding sources, financial projections, and exit strategies are explored as teams refine their pitches to potential investors.

COMPETITIONS

The Sustainable Venture Capital Investment Competition is an annual contest among eight of the nation’s top MBA programs and sponsored by the Net Impact Club at UNC. Participating students learn how venture capital firms view and analyze entrepreneurship and sustainability. Teams from the Kenan-Flagler Business School won the competition in 2011 and 2012.

The Carolina Challenge is a business and social venture competition that promotes entrepreneurship. Each challenge team must include at least one UNC student, faculty, or staff member. Finalists present their plans to a panel of judges comprised of successful entrepreneurs and business people as well as community and university leaders. The competition is segmented into four tracks, one of which focuses on social and environmental missions.

INCUBATORS

Providing spaces to gather, brainstorm, access advice, and prepare concepts for market is the role of the incubators and collaboration spaces sprouting both on and off campus.

She decided to focus her research on reasons why Environmental Studies was a predominately white field of study because she was the only black student in her class and one of only two African Americans enrolled in the program.  During her study, she found common trends of belief from students, faculty and staff in the reasoning behind this lack of participation from minority students.  In her interviews, minority participants offered the following reasons:

- the environment is not a priority for minority students
- the environment is not an interesting subject to minority students 
- unless they are directly affected by it, minority students won't take action 
- minority students did not know that Environmental Studies was offered as a major
- minority students lack knowledge about the field and what job opportunities are available

After completing the research, T’shari got an internship with the Office of Sustainability to work on addressing the issues found in her study.  She set two goals for this a project:  (1) spread awareness about how these environmental issues apply to people of every race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, and socioeconomic status; (2) bring attention to issues surrounding the low number of minority students enrolled in UNCG's Environmental Studies program and their lack of participation in campus sustainability initiatives.  T’shari came up with an innovative solution to host an event titled, ""What's Green Got to Do with It?"" gave all students (not just minorities) an interactive opportunity to learn about the UNCG Environmental Studies program and the Office of Sustainability as well as career opportunities and minority environmental leaders in the field.

The event also highlighted the issue of Environmental Justice by featuring a guest speaker with years of both personal and professional experience working with concerned citizens to shut down the local landfill.  To tie it all together at the end of the event, a UNCG professor from the new Sustainable Tourism and Hospitality program moderated a lively panel discussion that presented the environmental perspectives of students representing African American and Latino minorities.","The event was a huge success with approximately 100 people in attendance throughout the event.

This new certification system is the landscape corollary, with or without buildings, to the USGBC LEED ratings. The Green at College Park is a pioneering project at UTA that predominately functions as an ecological water detention system and large scale rain garden. The project is the first university campus project certified of the over 150 projects that were accepted by SITES for participation in the pilot project phase.","The SITES certification showed the value of considering all aspects of sustainability early on in the design process. The certification elevated the thinking of all participants. SITES raises the bar on landscape sustainability from LEED standards by rigorously covering the 9 areas above. This helps keep decision makers and designers from focusing on a few of the areas at the expense of others. The challenge for SITES will be to balance the rigor of their system with the commercial verities that will allow the certification to become a regular part of the development process. UTA has become an important part of that process by pushing through all obstacles and obtaining one of the first three certifications.
The SITES certification has been extensively covered in print and especially on the web.

Liquid plant nutrients are pumped through the tower and over the plant roots for rapid growth. This allows for fresh, local greens all year round. A student internship has been created just for the purpose of maintaining, and harvesting these tower gardens. 

The initial outlay for the complete system was $3,015","The program goals were to provide a means of growing produce that could be used in the All You Care To Eat dining operation on the UW Oshkosh campus.

•Our incoming Freshmen are not on board with sustainability and this would put something  sustainable  right in front of them where they could not miss   it
•Fresh greens being grown right next to the salad bar where they would be offered fit both locally grown as well as being better than organic, as no soil is used in growing the  plants.
•It was to provide opportunity for student involvement up to and including an internship for the student in charge of the Tower Gardens, from planting, cleaning, maintaining chemical balances in the water, and harvesting the lettuces routinely.
•The Tower Gardens would provide growing plants and bright lights during a time of year when daylight on campus is minimal. My hope is that they will help students feel a bit more cheerful during the dark months.
•The program is capable of expansion based on student input, participation, and funding.
•Provide a program with  minimal environmental  impact
     • No shipping,
     • minimal water  use versus  conventionally  grown product

Warren Wilson College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:30:05,aclimo@warren-wilson.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Composting demonstration site at Warren Wilson campus,"Warren Wilson College’s Recycling Center was processing compost from the cafeterias, residence halls and employee residences through an in-vessel rotating drum system. In that system, the compostable material, along with a bulking agent like wood chips or sawdust, is fed into a drum where moisture, temperature and aeration are controlled.

At capacity, that system is able to process 7.5 tons of compost each month. Unfortunately, the drums are simply incapable of holding the food waste and other material we need to compost to keep it from going to the landfill.

With grant money from WNC Communities and WNC Farmers Market designated for a composting demonstration site, the College built it on campus. With this partnership, we agreed to build the site and accept compostable material from the WNC Farmers Market.

Because this new composting operation requires a dedicated piece of loading machinery, Warren Wilson College Recycling and Waste Management Supervisor Jes Foster wrote a grant proposal to the TVA Ag & Forestry Fund and was awarded money to purchase a loader.

The new system incorporates six active compost bins. This new system allows us to process up to 65 tons of waste each month. In addition to being much faster and working at a higher capacity, our new system is able to decompose a larger variety of materials. Some of these include compostable plates, cups, paper towels, pizza boxes, animal bedding, and manure. Because of the high capacity of the bins, we are accepting waste from off campus.

This project has not just involved the Recycling Crew. Landscaping Crew, Farm Crew, and Facilities Management have all been a part of making this a reality.

“We’ve forged some mutually beneficial partnerships in the community on this project,” Foster said. “The new composting system will serve as a collaborative and practical demonstration site that has some very clear environmental and educational benefits for the College and the larger community.”

In February 2012, our most recent group of 15 grid-tied electric vehicle-charging stations and an adjacent 50kW solar photovoltaic array began operating near the Miller Auditorium parking deck (the second largest auditorium in the state). The project was funded through a $700,000 Department of Energy grant administered by the Clean Energy Coalition, which also offset the cost of five all-electric Ford/Azure Dynamics Transit Connect work vans and a hybrid-hydraulic bucket truck.

The strategic positioning of the array, delivering electricity into the WMU power grid, and the charging stations, provides a powerful educational opportunity for passing students and campus visitors.  Our five electric work vans are parked at these stations, further demonstrating linkages and opportunities between renewable energy production, energy consumption, and campus transportation.
","The solar photovoltaic array (solar panels):
-Generate enough energy annually to run about 5.6 average U.S. homes
-Generate enough energy each day, on average, to fully charge approximately 11 Chevrolet Volts, 7 Nissan Leafs, or 6 Azure Ford Battery Electric Transit Connects

The electric vehicle charging stations:
-Operate 24/7 on the ChargePoint network
-Are compatible with all electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
-And are free for public use through 2014

Benefits and opportunities of the system:
-Encourages the purchase and use of electric vehicles by providing access to charging infrastructure
-Supports WMU’s growing electric vehicle fleet
-Stores excess nighttime WMU-generated power in vehicle batteries for later use on campus
-Offsets an estimated 142,720 pounds of carbon dioxide annually
-Supports research and provides real-time data online

WMU’s electric vehicle charging capabilities are the new standard for campuses nationwide.
