We established a more aggressive Zero Waste goal, moving it from 2020 to 2016. We have encouraged recycling and composting throughout the campus by distributing composting crocs, setting up special collections for paper towels/Styrofoam/Terracycle/E-Waste/batteries/ink cartridges/Goodwill, phasing out non-compostable containers, hosting large zero waste events, and expanding our Zero-Waste education. We have collaborated with Housekeeping to obtain actual weights of all waste leaving our campus, assuring an accurate diversion calculation. Through these programs, we have improved our diversion rate from 45% to 68% since 2012. 

We made the Sierra Club’s Cool Schools list and the Princeton Review’s Green Schools list every year. Currently, we are piloting a new, cross functional structure for our campus sustainability committees, which encompasses three overarching themes of infrastructure, community, and learning. Our hope is to create transformational change at Aquinas through diverse discussions among students, staff, and faculty. 

Since fiscal year 2008, the college has successfully decreased its carbon footprint by 15% through a variety of energy efficiency measures. In the fall of 2013, we launched a new program called “AQ Bikes,” a bike rental program for the Aquinas Community. From 2013 to 2015, interest has grown among the Aquinas community and bike rentals have quadrupled. To further encourage alternative transportation, we increased the public bus subsidy so faculty, staff and students only pay $0.25 per ride. That is a savings of $1.50 per ride. Due to a generous grant from the Wege Foundation, real time sub-meters for electricity and displays in the lobbies were installed in 11 campus buildings in 2015 and 2016. The college also initiated a Green Revolving Fund in 2014 with seed money from the Wege Foundation. ",True,"Each of the three committees have the following mission and charges.

Mission Statement:

The mission of the Babson Sustainability Leadership Team is to coordinate efforts to realize Babson’s Sustainability commitments to embrace the concepts of Social, Environmental, Economic Responsibility and Sustainability (SEERS) and Entrepreneurial Thought and Action (ET&A), which includes reducing its carbon footprint to zero over time. This team will instill the inclination to act by increasing sustainability awareness and understanding on campus to every student, faculty, and staff member. This team will advocate the consideration of sustainability as a factor in all institutional decisions as well as identify areas for sustainability action and provide suggestions to achieve key sustainability goals. 

Description of Leadership Team's Purview and Activities -

Resource sustainability is critically important to Babson College, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the nation.  Efficient energy use is central to this objective, and renewable energy and energy-conservation efforts provide a means to save money, foster environmental awareness, reduce the environmental consequences of College activities, and provide educational leadership for the 21st century.

The College is committed to stewardship of the environment and to reducing the College’s dependence on non-renewable energy sources.  With this commitment in mind, we will regularly review initiatives and best practices and share successes by augmenting the existing College guidelines.  These guidelines currently recommend that College operations:

•	Incorporate the principals of energy efficiency and sustainability in all capital projects, renovation projects, and operations and maintenance within budgetary constraints and programmatic requirements.

•	Minimize the use of non-renewable energy sources on behalf of the College’s built environment by creating a portfolio approach to energy use, including the use of local renewable energy and purchase of green power from the grid as well as conservation measures that reduce energy consumption.

•	Incorporate alternative means of transportation to/from and within the campus to improve the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community.  The College will continue its strong commitment to provide affordable on-campus housing, in order to reduce the volume of commutes to and from campus.  

•	Track, report and minimize greenhouse gas emissions on behalf of College operations.

•	Minimize the amount of College generated waste sent to landfill.

•	Utilize the College’s purchasing power to meet its sustainability objectives.

The Office of the Vice President for Administration will annually report to the Cabinet on the Policy’s impact on capital and operating costs, and overall campus sustainable practices.

This BSSC’s goal is to help align the Babson community with the principles of sustainability. These include:
•	Encouraging the content of learning to reflect interdisciplinary systems thinking with a special emphasis on social, ethical and environmental consideration as they relate to entrepreneurial business development and management approaches
•	Adjusting the content of learning to make human environment interdependence, values and ethics a seamless and central part of the teaching discipline
•	Encouraging the process of education to emphasize active, experiential, inquiry-based learning and real world problem solving on the campus and in the larger community with emphasis on the growing “Clean Tech” areas of business development
•	Encouraging the practice of sustainability on the campus as an integral part of operations, planning, facility design, purchasing, and investments and tie these efforts to the formal curriculum
•	Forming partnerships with local and regional communities to help make them healthy, socially vibrant, economically secure, and environmentally sustainable as an integral part of Babson’s mission and the student experience.
Vision Statement
Babson College aspires to work towards a sustainable campus life which protects and enhances the environment and health of the staff and students. The College strives to become a leader in environmental sustainability by educating our students, employees and neighboring community. Through an integrated approach, which incorporates economic, human and ecological health and viability, we will support Babson’s mission today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Mission
Babson College is committed to minimizing the College’s impact on the environment and reducing the College’s dependence on non-renewable energy. This Committee is charged with establishing guidelines for the College’s Sustainable Practices including:  Green Building Design; Green Building Renovations; Climate Protection Practices; Clean Energy Standards; Sustainable Transportation Practices; Sustainable Operations; Recycling and Waste Management; and Environmentally Preferable Procurement. Since Babson signed the American College and University President’s Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) this Committee will develop recommended steps to achieve the goals of this program. The above will include plans to:
•	Efficiently use and conserve water, energy and other resources
•	Implement ecological transportation alternatives

In 2014:  
The College wrote and passed a 3 year strategic plan for Sustainability including goals around curriculum, campus engagement, and operations.  
The Steering Committee released a call for proposals from faculty and staff for Sustainability Citizen Courses and Leader Teams, which are funded opportunities to engage research and study of sustainability in a wide variety of disciplines.
The Sustainability Coordinator began work on a communications campaign, introducing new webpages and revamping old webpages around sustainability.  Sustainability Assistants (hired work-study students) were tasked with educating their peers about sustainability concepts through the newly created Beloit College Sustainability Facebook page, and articles within the institution's online news forum, the Terrarium and student newspaper, the Round Table.
The Sustainability Coordinator worked with students, staff, and faculty, to introduce, research, and eventually pass several new projects to the Revolving Loan Fund, doubling the amount of projects seen by the Revolving Loan Fund in previous years.

The college has implemented numerous sustainability accomplishments during the previous three years, many of which can be found at http://www.bowdoin.edu/sustainability/   A few examples include: 1) The installation of a 1.2 MW solar PV power purchase agreement on college owned land, which now provides roughly 8% of Bowdoin's electricity use.  2) The establishment of a relationship with Goodwill of Northern New England to handle all of the items left on campus during the student move-out at the end of the academic year.  In 2014 this eliminated 56 tons of material from the waste stream. 3) The implementation of 20 lighting efficiency projects over the three year period, saving over 750,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. 4) Managing the implementation of an Energy Dashboard for the campus that provides realtime metering for electricity and steam use at 58 campus buildings and is utilized to promote energy conservation competitions among student residence halls. ",True,"The Sustainability Implementation Committee is responsible for identifying, funding, and tracking greenhouse gas-reducing initiatives, reporting annually on the College’s greenhouse gas emissions, and updating the Carbon Neutrality Implementation Plan every two years.

This Office serves the university in a variety of critical functions. First, we provide engineering expertise regarding new construction, renovation projects, utility systems and energy projects. In addition, the department establishes the campus Strategic Energy Plan (SEP). This plan develops the long term goals and objectives for overall energy reduction on campus thereby saving tens of millions of dollars over time. 

Secondly, the department provide sustainability expertise for the campus as well. This includes Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) development for new and existing buildings, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) assessments and the very critical Climate Action Plan (CAP). The CAP is the strategic mechanism that establishes the systematic approach toward campus climate neutrality. In addition, the department is responsible for the development and expansion of the campus recycling program. 

Lastly, the department provides a full complement of CAD and GIS services including drafting, archival, photographic, utility master planning and geographic locating systems to support the long term mission of the university.  

Facilities Operations Sustainability Programs, under the purview of Engineering and Sustainability, identifies, tracks, documents, and promotes campus sustainability initiatives and accomplishments.  Through ongoing benchmarking, we provide information needed to set goals and make timely, effective choices that minimize our cost of doing business, meet regulatory requirements, enhance student, staff, and faculty experience, and maximize campus resilience.


The Center for Sustainability:
The Center was established at CSUF in 2009 and is a campus focal point for sustainability-centered activities. These include facilitating the development and inclusion of sustainability-centered topics in the university's curriculum, supporting external grant-getting by faculty members and other members of the university community, encouraging interaction among faculty members from different disciplines, reaching out to members of the greater community interested in sustainability, providing leadership in efforts to make the campus more sustainable, and coordinating sustainability-related activities on campus.

The Center has seven interrelated main functions:
-Raising awareness and building capacity regarding sustainability on campus through the Center web portal, organizing town halls and other interactive events;
-Supporting sustainability-related educational activities by faculty and students through developing curriculum and providing a base for student organizations;
-Enhancing faculty capacity by promoting collegial interaction through symposia, workshops, webinars, and a virtual community;
-Providing educational resources to the community regarding sustainability through a community advisory board, and interface with area businesses, policy agencies, and community organizations;
-Acting as a resource center for developing research related to sustainability, including logistic support; and facilitating extramural grant acquisition;
-Coordinating sustainability-related activities across campus; and
-Leading efforts to make the campus environment more sustainable.

In addition to these core functions, the Center of Sustainability is a key element in a transdisciplinary sustainability-centered virtual community of practice with in-person and virtual (online) components, focused on the recruitment, retention, and success of students in the Environmental Studies graduate program. Studying, identifying, and solving problems related to sustainability is, by definition, transdisciplinary and lends itself to a community of practice (Kleef and deMoor 2004). This community of practice requires a local focal point for research, curriculum development and collegial interaction surrounding the topic of sustainability. CSU Fullerton by virtue of its Environmental Studies graduate program, its transdisciplinary approach to sustainability and active student body is a prime location for a local center to meet this need.

The Center will establish a transdisciplinary virtual community of practice (TVCoP) that will enhance graduate education for Hispanic Americans in a sustainability-centered Environmental Studies curriculum. Our TVCoP will serve as a recruitment and retention tool for Hispanic American graduate students, a forum for sharing of expertise and as a repository of best practices pertaining to sustainability topics that will be incorporated in the graduate Environmental Studies curriculum, a professional networking resource for our students and community, and a source for research and professional expertise.

In May 2013, Sac State completed the four major components of the Smart Grid Grant project which included:
High Voltage Smart Electric Switches:
Four switches are in use to allow for automated rerouting of power on the campus owned 12,000 volt electric circuits.
 Smart Electric Meters:
Installation of 58 smart electric meters was completed in campus buildings (including non-State buildings); these meters report to an Energy Information System software.
Energy Management and Control Systems (EMCS):
Replacement of the old and outdated EMCS occurred in 38 buildings with nearly 37,000
monitoring and control points. This allowed for central real time monitoring and control of environmental conditions within each of the buildings and the ability to control and minimize energy consumption.
Electric Vehicle Charging Stations:
Installation of 14 electric vehicle charging stations was completed on campus and is also
available for public use. There are four stations located in Parking Structure 1, seven located in Parking Structure 2, and three located in Parking Lot 1. 

Sac State implemented two PV solar panel projects totaling a maximum capacity of 500 kW. They were both roof mounted PV systems located on the Library (272 kW) and The WELL (228 kW). Both projects were completed in March 2013 as Power Purchase Agreements. Sac State replaced 30 existing High Pressure Sodium lights in Yosemite Hall’s North Gym with 20 LED lamps with individual occupancy sensors that resulted in 73% energy savings, reduced maintenance cost due to longer lamp life, and better lighting quality. Sac State has an ongoing project to replace the existing High Pressure
Sodium pathway lights with Induction lamps, which has resulted in 43%
energy savings and reduced maintenance costs due to longer lamp life. Sac State has replaced the existing High Pressure Sodium cobra head street lighting fixtures with energy efficient LED street lights. The project has resulted in 54% energy savings, reduced maintenance costs, and better lighting quality and color. Beginning in Fall 2012, drought-tolerant plant materials installed throughout campus are more
sustainable—requiring less water and less pruning—thus generating less green waste. Currently Sac State aerates approximately 30 acres of campus lawn with research showing up to a 25% savings in water usage possible if done regularly. For the first time on November 14, 2012, Sac State was recognized by the national Arbor Day
Foundation as a Tree Campus USA. Sac State was awarded this designation for the 2nd year in a row in 2013. Effective January 27, 2014, all five active shuttles now use Atlas ReFuel’s compressed natural gas (CNG) biogas for fuel exclusively. Only the fuel from the non-fossil source of organics produced by Clean World’s anaerobic bio-digester delivered and processed into renewable natural gas is considered carbon negative, which means the University has made the choice to purchase and use gas that essentially destroys carbon. In July 2014, UTAPS retired three aging enforcement trucks (90’s Ford Ranger) due to age and condition. Rather than replace the trucks with more trucks, the enforcement team reviewed their requirements and determined that a truck was no longer required for every day operations as long as the team lead had a truck. UTAPS consulted with various other parking enforcement agencies and decided to go green with the replacements. UTAPS has procured three plug-in Toyota Prius vehicles and outfitted them with safety lights and identifying labels. The new vehicles are more visible, approachable and are significantly more sustainable.

As an educational institution, Colgate recognizes its responsibility to promote understanding of environmental stewardship and sustainable practices among its faculty, staff, and students.  Colgate's setting near the foothills of the Adirondacks in central New York makes this responsibility an especially important one. With increased regional, national and global awareness of the importance of environmental and sustainability issues, and a keen sense of the leadership role educational institutions must assume in promoting best practices in sustainability, it is incumbent on the Colgate community to exploit the opportunities and meet the challenges inherent in this role.  We believe that the university’s educational mission provides us with unusual opportunities to foster sustainable practices as we determine how to most efficiently and responsibly use, preserve, and renew our institutional resources.  Through our collaborative efforts administrators, faculty, staff, students and members of the surrounding Hamilton community can join together to promote greater emphasis upon sustainability and to steward Colgate’s campus and land holdings.

The Sustainability Council is charged with (1) encouraging the development of a coordinated vision for short-term and long-term planning for the University to ensure a safe, healthy and sustainable campus environment and infrastructure, including the protection of the integrity and beauty of the campus and other Colgate lands; (2) making recommendations concerning conservation issues including resource use and development, energy efficiency, waste reduction and recycling, pollution abatement, environmentally-responsible building methods and other measures consistent with environmentally sustainable practices; (3) assisting the institution with environmental audits on a regular basis (ca. 10 year periods); and (4) promoting and publicizing the activities and successes of the institution involving sustainability as part of our overall strategic goal of deepening Colgate’s status as a leading liberal arts institution.","The Sustainability Council is composed of a representative group of faculty, administrators, and students and will include the Director of Sustainability, the Associate Vice President for Facilities, the Associate Provost, the Directors of Environmental Studies and Outdoor Education, three additional faculty appointed by the President from the Natural and Social Sciences and the Humanities, a representative from Communications, the DOC staff, and the Upstate Institute, the Manager of Environmental Health and Safety, and two students appointed by the President.  This composition will ensure strong ties between the educational and operational components of the institution and maintain close communication among these entities.

CCS and the Director of Energy Education and Management work in tandem on all aspects of sustainability initiatives. Over the past three years they have played a large part in the discussion of carbon offsets and their role in achieving carbon neutrality as an institution. These discussions led to the decision to move away from carbon offsets towards a more holistic and encompassing path towards our energy goals, as outlined in the 2013 Energy Framework, which set goals and milestones for making the college fossil fuel-free by 2050. CCS played a key role in the decision of the college to divest from fossil fuels and fossil fuel-related corporations in its investment portfolio.  CCS has spearheaded the construction of new, sustainable infrastructure for the college, including the installation of solar arrays on the Peggy Rockefeller Farm campus and the Davis Village student housing, LED lighting across a variety of spaces around campus, and the updating of various energy conservation efforts in buildings including the greenhouses and computer labs. Recent accomplishments also include, but are not limited to: tripling the number of clotheslines on campus; procuring biodiesel for farm tractors, vehicles, and heating; arranging the donation of new electric vehicles to the college; establishing new solar-powered electric vehicle charging stations on campus; developing and implementing campus signage on energy topics; and increasing covered bike storage by 30%.
",True,"In 2009, the college created a standing committee to ensure a democratic and transparent method of managing social, economic, and environmental sustainability while also highlighting the importance of sustainability in the COA community. As the Campus Committee for Sustainability (CCS) charter reads, the committee’s purpose is to: encourage and maintain a sense of social and environmental accountability in all aspects of the college’s operation; promote leadership, responsibility, and involvement among COA community members regarding issues of sustainability; maintain and encourage transparency, oversight, and clarity in regard to college sustainability; and advise the COA community on the most environmentally and socially responsible courses of action. ","While membership varies from term to term, the student-led CCS typically has about a dozen student members, two faculty, and the Director of Energy Education and Management, who remains as a permanent member. The committee is a part of the college's governance system.

-Provides leadership and expertise in all matters related to energy, moving the college toward greater use of renewable energy, decreasing overall energy use, and expanding educational opportunities for students in energy and related areas.
-Supervises two graduate student positions: the discarded resources graduate fellow and the sustainable energy graduate fellow. 

When our long-time director of sustainability resigned in 2014, we decided to make a tactical change with the position on two fronts: 

1. We percieve the climate problem as basically an energy problem (how we generate it and how much of it we use.) So focusing more on energy ""names the system"" more explicitly, and places emphasis on that aspect of sustainability above others (though not in exclusion of others). 

2. We see this position as being primarily about education. While our operations should be as sustainable as possible, our central mission as an institution is to educate students to prepare them to be leaders in sustainability. Any sustainability efforts the college undertakes should be meaningfully grounded in educational experiences for students.

By increasing its membership to include a diverse group of faculty, staff and students, the Council has been able to successfully influence the wider campus community. The Council was responsible for adding the various sustainability components to the College's Strategic Plan.  Last year, the Council pushed the administration to prioritize sustainability in its professional staffing, leading to the replacement of the Sustainability Coordinator with two higher up and full-time positions, the Energy Manager and the Sustainability Manager.  Furthermore, in the last few years, the Council has lobbied for and successfully increased the College's dedicated budget for sustainability projects.  The money has helped support the construction of a campus greenhouse, an online energy monitoring system, and campus signage for sustainability features.  The Council presented a plan and strategy for reaching the College's carbon neutrality goal by 2020.  

The previous Sustainability Coordinator operated as a subset of Facilities and was instrumental in implementing the dashboard system, implementing composting programs for both dining services and off-campus housing, supporting the expansion of non-potable irrigation across campus, developing the student garden, and implementing a green-cleaning policy (amongst many others).  The new Office of Sustainabiliy continues to focus on those items, but is placed in the Office of the Dean of the College, giving the Sustainability Manager access and influence on a higher level of administration and curriculum development as it relates to sustainability principles.

In 2015, the Campus Sustainability Council has been integral in advocating for a carbon neutral library drafting a petition and unanimously voting to support a carbon neutral library. The CSC has created a Sustainability Action Plan to be signed by the President of the college. This plan outlines specific sustainability projects with clear goals, responsible parties, and deadlines. The CSC has reconfigured its subcommittees to include: Investments, Conservation Campaigns, Green Sciences, Academics, Operations, and Communications/Community Outreach.

Listed below are substantive accomplishments of Sustainable Duke. Sustainable Duke continues to work diligently on expanding projects related to buildings, carbon offsets, campus farm, dining, energy, land management, purchasing and transportation. 

Duke is committed to expanding its green buildings on campus. In 2011, Duke's Campus Sustainability Committee (CSC) drafted a LEED™ Plus policy that includes:

A documented process for LEED™ scorecard development with energy efficiency approvals;
Energy targets by building tech rating;
Measurement, verification and reporting of energy consumption versus energy modeling; and
A requirement that all value engineering efforts focus on areas outside of energy savings and that any proposed value engineering items within this category shall be accompanied with a full life cycle cost analysis.

In addition, Duke is committed to sustainable agriculture. The Duke Campus Farm is a long-term project to construct a fully functional and educational farm. The farm aspires to engage students with food issues, increase sustainability at Duke, and influence campus culture to reconnect students with their food.In August 2011, the first full-time farm manager was hired, supported by Sustainable Duke and Duke Dining.  An additional Farm Fellowship position was created in 2012.  The farm continues to expand fruit and vegetable operations with each season.

Also, one of the pillars of Sustainable Duke is carbon offsets research and project development. The Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative (DCOI) is the first college/university based initiative that solely focuses on carbon offset project research and development. To date, the DCOI has partnered to develop a swine waste-to-energy system in Yadkinville,NC where hog waste is turned into renewable energy and carbon offsets, two employee benefit programs in residential energy efficiency and rooftop solar, and urban forestry where the DCOI helps plant trees in local cities in NC. ",True,"The Duke University Campus Sustainability Committee (CSC), a standing committee appointed by the President, is responsible for making recommendations to guide campus sustainability policies, championing these sustainability initiatives and communicating them to each member's respective constituencies to foster a more sustainable campus community.

For 2014-2015, the CSC will continue to expand the current Climate Action Plan (CAP) to a broader Sustainability Strategic Plan (SSP), which will include targets and policies regarding other elements of sustainability such as water, recycling/waste reduction, food, supply-chain management and land use. The CSC will continue to monitor and report progress on emissions reductions and other CAP milestones, as well as take steps to engage the Duke community in these efforts.

Emory University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 16:26:25,ciannat.howett@emory.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Emory’s Office of Sustainability Initiatives has been guided by the vision established in the Strategic Plan of creating a community where economic, social and environmental systems support a healthy, productive and meaningful life for all its residents, present and future.  To this end, Emory’s initiative has sought to create a model for healthy living, locally and globally and to collaborate beyond our campus gates to provide leadership in our community, the region, and beyond.  

Since the launch of our initiative, Emory has made significant progress in achieving the aggressive goals established by the Sustainability Visioning Committee in 2006.  Emory expects to meet the goal of 25% energy use reduction per square foot by 2015, and expects to meet its goal to divert 65% of its waste, including 95% of construction and demolition waste, from landfills.  Significant progress has also been made in the areas of ecosystem restoration, transportation, local and sustainable food procurement, sustainable building practices, awareness of sustainability practices, and integration of sustainability into the curriculum.  Systems of measurement have been established to monitor our progress and encourage adaptive management.  

In the past three years, significant accomplishments of the initiative include but are not limited to the following: implemented Emory’s Climate Action Plan, celebrated thirteen years of the renowned Piedmont Project, funded dozens of sustainability-related campus projects through its Sustainability Incentives Fund, expanded student engagement opportunities, rolled-out a post-consumer waste composting program, increased sustainable food education in the cafeterias, launched Green Office and Green Lab programs, conducted solar energy feasibility studies, developed waste and energy reduction programs in Emory’s healthcare facilities, enrolled Emory University Hospital Midtown in the DOE’s Better Buildings Challenge, implemented comprehensive energy and water reduction strategies, conducted pilots to increase Emory’s waste diversion from campus buildings, secured land and hired a farmer to develop an organic farm at Emory’s Oxford Campus, acquired a grant to hire a two-year post-doc Sustainability Distinguished Teaching Fellow specializing in sustainability-related behavior change, developed and trained Residence Hall Association Sustainability Chairs, added sustainability training components to numerous academic orientations, and more. ",True,"The Sustainability Advisory Council was formed as an outgrowth of the 2005 Strategic Plan, which identified sustainability as one of Emory's core principles and charged the committee with developing a vision for the responsible environmental, economic, and social future of Emory. The committee completed the Sustainability Vision in 2006 and defined specific goals and recommendations intended to stimulate the imagination and guide decision making, resource use, and future action in all parts of the university. The Vision also called for the creation of the Office of Sustainability Initiatives, also created in 2006. The original Sustainability Advisory Council does not meet regularly now that the strategic vision is in implementation mode, but members remain available for consultation and participate in various other sustainability committees. As the 2005 Strategic Plan comes to a close, the Council will be revived with new and existing members to plan for the next phase of sustainability at Emory.

In Fall 2010, a Faculty Advisory Council was created to advise the Office of Sustainability on issues related to curriculum and research. This group of distinguished faculty from Arts and Sciences, Medicine, Business, Law, Nursing, and Public Health report to the Provost.

In addition to the Sustainability Advisory Council and the Faculty Advisory Council, the following sustainability-related committees also exist:

Sustainable Food Committee:
The Sustainable Food Committee was appointed by President Wagner in early 2007 to develop recommendations for meeting the food-related goals contained in the University's Sustainability Vision. Specifically, the Committee was charged with developing steps to meet Emory's goal of procuring 75 percent of ingredients in our cafeterias and hospitals from local or sustainably-grown sources by 2015. The Committee was also tasked with working with farmers and distributors to bolster regional food supplies, developing a farmers market on campus, developing guidelines for sustainable food procurement, overseeing the Educational Garden Project, and expanding awareness of sustainability issues related to food.

Sustainability Task Force for the Health Sciences:
In 2008, the Executive Vice President for Health Sciences appointed a Sustainability Task Force.  This group consists of broad representation of faculty, staff, and administrators from the healthcare related parts of Emory.  It has undertaken a review of activities in healthcare and has made high-level recommendations for policy and practice.

Climate Action Plan Committee: 
The CAP Committee was appointed in 2010 to begin the process of education and outreach to engage the Emory community in greenhouse gas reduction and to develop a formal commitment and Plan. The committee consists of faculty, staff, and students and works closely with Campus Services.

Energy Think Tank: 
Originally the Carbon Reduction Task Force, this group researches staffing and infrastructure needs related to feasibility assessment on the operations side to support the implementation of our Climate Action Plan.

Waste Think Tank:
Similar to the Energy Think Tank, this group meets quarterly to brainstorm and implement staffing and infrastructure efforts necessary to meet the University’s goal of 65% of waste diverted from the landfill. 

Sustainability Representatives:
This group consists of at least one representative from each of Emory’s buildings with the goals of assisting with the development, communication and implementation of Emory’s sustainability programs to the campus community, and providing feedback to the Office of Sustainability Initiatives on these programs. 

Sustainability Team:
Consisting of representatives from the key stakeholder groups and departments across campus, this team has a monthly “meeting of the minds” to share status updates, solve problems, and celebrate successes encountered during the implementation of Emory’s sustainability programs.

Green Lab Team:
This team meets monthly to develop, implement, and monitor Emory’s newly created Green Lab Program. 

Green Office Team:
This team meets monthly to develop, implement, and monitor Emory’s Green Office Program, currently in development.

Committee on the Environment:
Created in 1990, the Committee on the Environment is a standing committee of the Emory University Senate. The Committee is comprised of faculty, staff, and students. The Committee works closely with Campus Services and meets monthly to review all projects undertaken by Emory that impact the environment, including new buildings, transportation initiatives, and forest management. In policy matters, COE has promoted conservation and sustainable development and facilitated Emory's eventual adoption of Green Building standards, a No Net Loss of Tree Canopy policy, a Water Conservation Policy, the Land Use plan that preserves natural areas from development, the Lullwater Management Plan, a Stormwater Management Plan, a Campus Environmental Office, and an Office of Sustainability.

It includes 10 research institutes, affiliated faculty (both those teaching 'Green Leaf' courses and those undertaking sustainability-related research), the Office of Sustainability, and Planet Forward. The purpose of the GW Sustainability Collaborative is to coordinate GW activities and communicate those activities internally and externally. Further, the purpose is to provide the organizational framework for our multi-disciplinary team to identify emerging opportunities to advance the field.  

Kathleen Merrigan serves as Executive Director of Sustainability at GW, and is assisted by Prof. Lisa Benton Short (teaching lead), Meghan Chapple (practice lead), Frank Sesno (engagement lead). GW is in the process of searching for a research lead to complete the leadership team.  

PRACTICE OVERVIEW
The Office of Sustainability has been working with partners across the university and externally to advance sustainability on campus and in practice, in Washington DC, and globally since 2009. In the previous three years from 2012-2014, the Office has had many accomplishments including the publication of the university's strategy for sustainability in practice (as opposed to in teaching or research). This strategy document titled GW Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy intends to build institutional understanding of, and commitment toward sustainability at GW, and engage GW’s external and community stakeholders. This strategy also outlines potential connections with the academic mission of the university. Simultaneously, the Office has worked with partners to improve GW's sustainability performance related to climate change, air quality, water quality and availability, waste reduction, food, biodiversity and grounds. The Office has launched programs such as the Student Sustainability Pledge and the Green Office Certification to build a culture and community of sustainability amongst GW students, faculty, and staff.  Below are the most significant accomplishments in terms of impact across the university. 

- In 2012 the Office worked closely with the Provost's Office, the Deans across all schools, and the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Trustees to approve a cross-disciplinary, pan-university sustainability minor and to hire an Academic Director. In Fall 2012 the George Washington University introduced a new 18-credit Minor in Sustainability, open to all undergraduate students.  

- Throughout 2012-2014 the Office worked closely with the Provost's Office, a faculty committee from across all schools, and the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Trustees to recruit and hire the Executive Director of the Sustainability. 

- In 2013 the Office of Sustainability and Facilities Services led the launch of the Eco Building Program to address energy use in existing buildings, which comprises 80 percent of the university's GHG emissions.  The Eco Building Program provides a comprehensive capital improvement plan to strategically implement energy and water conservation projects in campus buildings.  

- In Spring 2014, the university signed the Real Food Challenge, making a leadership commitment to a student-led campaign to make university food more local, fair, ecologically sound and humane.

- Over the last several years, the Office has worked within the Division of Operations to help GW open eleven USGBC LEED buildings on campus, one of which is the first Platinum academic building in the District of Columbia.

- Most recently in 2014, the Office led the launch of the Capital Partners Solar Project, an innovative renewable energy project that generates electricity at three project sites for the George Washington University (GW), American University (AU) and the George Washington University Hospital (GWUH). It is comprised of 52 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic (PV) power. 

TEACHING OVERVIEW
As described in greater detail under curriculum, GW now has 400 courses with sustainability content, a thriving undergraduate minor in sustainability, and multiple degree pfferings related to sustainability.. 

RESEARCH OVERVIEW
GW has 170 faculty engaged in research related to sustainability and 10 research institutes engaged in aspects of sustainability research.  

ENGAGEMENT OVERVIEW 
Planet Forward, as our lead engagement tool, is an innovative platform used by students who employ storytelling as a way to engage on sustainability innovations.  Since 2009, the website has had more than 2 million views, typically 20,000 unique visitors per month, and hosts more than 3,500 videos.  In 2014, Planet Forward began building a campus consortium, which includes 15 universities.  Also, in 2014, Planet Forward contributed to National Geographic's The Plate blog, under ""campus voices.""",True,"The university-wide Sustainability Faculty Committee meets no less than quarterly.

The purpose is to coordinate campus-wide sustainability activities across research, teaching, practice, and engagement as well as to identify opportunities for GW leadership. Currently, the Collaborative has a staff of 3.35 FTEs. 

The Office of Sustainability opened in January 2009, following the completion of the Task Force Report on Sustainability convened by President Knapp upon his arrival at the university. Since then, the Office has provided a strategic home for sustainability initiatives on campus, and the office works in partnership with many stakeholders on campus and in the community. The Office focuses primarily on the university's practice of sustainability in its operations, business decisions, living at GW, and in the community. The Office does this by helping with tasks such as: 
-	Setting sustainability goals related to the above areas
-	Supporting others at GW with the integration of activities into their current work 
-	Engaging with students to better serve their interests on campus, provide service-learning, and build momentum on student projects
-	Facilitating partnerships between the university and external leaders on initiatives and events – community partners, non-profit organizations, multi-lateral organizations, business, local and national government, funders, peer institutions, others 
-	Helping to identify resources for sustainability efforts and sharing best practices across the university and with other sustainability practitioners
-	Identifying and incubating sustainability projects that don’t yet have a “home” in the university and the community

GW’s Office of Sustainability works closely with many departments on campus such as facilities, services, and campus planning, campus development and construction who lead the design and construction, and facilities operation and maintenance work. In addition, the Office of Sustainability supports and partners with other divisions ranging from the president’s office and the provost’s office, to food and dining, procurement, investment, human resources, finance, fundraising and development, student activities as well as various schools to integrate sustainability into the fabric of the organization.

7.  Jessa Orluk, Environmental and Reproductive Justice Fellow, Population and Development (PopDev) Program  (full time)
The Hirshberg grant funded the first PopDev Environmental and Reproductive Justice Fellow during the 2013-2014 academic year.  The Fellow facilitated several conversations on environmental justice and racism, supported a panel discussion centered on the question, “Is militarism sustainable”, and worked to incorporate environmental justice into the annual CLPP conference.  Based on the success of this fellow program, we have allocated funding for a second year, where the Fellow will engage the college community, particularly students, with issues of sustainability and social justice through participatory workshops, site visits to environmental justice initiatives in the Bronx, Holyoke and Worcester, and publications on key climate justice issues. Their goal is to further the Hampshire community's thinking on social justice as a key component of sustainability and to share this critical take through PopDev publications to national and international audiences.

Mills became the first college in a national program to deploy mobile solar generators in partnership with solar company DC Solar Freedom. Mills has deployed 12 solar generators so far and is contracted to deploy up to 18 more units, each with approximately 50kWh battery capacity. These solar generators immediately reduce our reliance on fossil-fuel based energy and increase our emergency preparedness. Many of these solar units are connected to services including electric vehicle charging stations, LED light towers, and personal device charging work stations.

Sustainability Committee members’ deep engagement in the strategic planning process culminated in a strong institutional commitment to further inclusion, social justice and sustainability. A working group that included faculty and staff from the Sustainability Committee investigated the place of social justice, civic engagement, and sustainability in a liberal arts college for women and in our co-educational graduate programs and contributed to the following vision:

The strategic imperative 3, to strengthen our commitment to inclusion, social justice, and sustainability includes:

1) Providing opportunities for students to connect Mills’ experiences to interests in diversity, social justice, and sustainability. In thinking about this imperative, Mills can be a “living laboratory” to define and redefine social justice, build community, engage with communities beyond campus, and live in sustainable, climate-neutral ways. Mills is a campus full of intellectual and physical resources for our own learning about social justice and sustainability and for the larger Oakland community as well. Learning in this “laboratory” is not only extracurricular but also connected to the curriculum.

2) Creating an environment inclusive of all diversity. Creating a just, equitable, and inclusive environment for all students, while paying attention to diversity along many lines of identity including, for example, race, class, sexual orientation, ability, spirituality and religious diversity is ongoing work.

3) Focusing on sustainability across campus. Mills has been committed to sustainability for years. However, learning to live it in every aspect of our working lives remains a challenge. While Mills can be a learning laboratory of sustainability, helping students learn through curricular and co-curricular work about social justice and equality in the world around them, it is imperative that the Mills community live and model the value we hold dear. Mills will pursue initiatives which enable us to be viewed as a 21st century college committed to sustainability with efforts including developing a campus farm, adopting energy savings measures, promoting food justice and participating in the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment to lessen our environmental footprint.

Onondaga Community College,2016-02-26,2016-02-26 16:33:50,vormwals@sunyocc.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Onondaga Community College is committed to improving the sustainability of the campus by considering the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the College’s decisions. The sustainability initiative began in 2007 when Onondaga Community College joined the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment. By joining the Presidents’ Climate Commitment, Onondaga agreed to become carbon neutral, or eliminate the College’s greenhouse gas emissions. Since then the College has been successfully working to integrate sustainability throughout campus operations, incorporate sustainability into the curriculum, inform the campus about Onondaga’s sustainability efforts, and promote sustainability in the community.

The College has developed a framework for effectively advancing greenhouse gas reduction and sustainability efforts on campus. Onondaga established a Sustainability Task Force to assist with developing the Sustainability Action Plan. The College also hired a sustainability director to coordinate campus sustainability efforts and greenhouse gas emission reduction initiatives. Onondaga’s goals related to the Presidents’ Climate Commitment have been incorporated into the College’s strategic planning process, ensuring that sustainability remains an institutional priority. The College recently reaffirmed its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance sustainability-related learning opportunities for students through the American Campuses Act on Climate Pledge, a national effort organized by the White House prior to the December 2015 United Nations climate conference in Paris. 
	
Onondaga has already made progress toward the goals of the Presidents’ Climate Commitment with emissions declining from the 2007 baseline despite a growing campus. The College has been able to reduce energy consumption by implementing many energy efficiency improvements across campus. Onondaga has even received recognition for the College’s outstanding energy performance in some campus buildings. Three of the College’s residence hall buildings earned the Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star label in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, demonstrating that the buildings are more energy efficient than 90% of similar residence halls in the country. 
	
Onondaga is also integrating sustainable principles into the College’s construction projects. The SRC Arena and Events Center and the Academic II building both earned Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, exceeding their original goals of achieving LEED Silver. Among other sustainable features, these buildings conserve energy, use less water, and are more comfortable for building occupants than traditionally designed buildings. 

Onondaga is also utilizing renewable energy to help power the campus. The College renovated the Furnace Brook Center in order to create a “smart” home laboratory for the Electrical Technology Program. The building has many sustainable features including solar panels, a geothermal heating and cooling system, and a sophisticated electricity monitoring and controls system. The building is used as an educational tool to teach students about green technology. Also, in July 2011 the College installed a 21.16 kW solar array on the roof of the Whitney Applied Technology Center. The solar panels provide learning opportunities for students and generate approximately 25,000 kWh of electricity to help power the building. The College also purchases renewable energy for 30% of campus electricity. These Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) support electricity made from non-polluting wind energy. 
	
The College is also managing the campus grounds in a sustainable manner by implementing Onondaga’s Sustainable Landscape Master Plan. By growing meadows across campus and using native and low-maintenance plants, the College has been able to reduce the resources and labor needed to maintain the campus landscaping. This allows the College to protect the environment while keeping the campus looking great. Onondaga has also installed rain gardens, permeable pavement, and other green infrastructure in order to improve stormwater management and provide a learning tool for students. These efforts will be expanded as the result of a recent grant from the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation. 

Onondaga partnered with the student-run Whole Earth Club to plant a fruit tree orchard to provide a local, healthy, and sustainable food source for the campus community. The College also installed a raised bed herb garden for the Hospitality Management Program in order to teach students about growing fresh ingredients for their culinary dishes. Additionally, Onondaga created a food pantry to help improve food security for campus community members.  

Onondaga is working to reduce emissions from commuting and the College’s vehicle fleet. Onondaga currently offers a 20% subsidy to students for bus passes, and Onondaga’s Fair Deal program allows employees to purchase bus tickets pre-tax in order to promote public transportation ridership. The College also installed bike lanes throughout campus in order to promote bicycling, and installed sidewalks across campus in order to increase pedestrian access. Onondaga also installed two electric vehicle charging stations to encourage students, employees, and campus visitors to use electric vehicles for their commute. Onondaga is also incorporating fuel efficient vehicles into the College’s fleet including the use of electric GEM cars and hybrid vehicles. 

Onondaga has also been doing well in waste reduction and recycling efforts. The College finished strong in RecycleMania 2015, a national recycling contest between colleges and universities. Onondaga placed 1st in New York State and 20th nationally in the Waste Minimization category, meaning that Onondaga generated very little trash and recyclables per person compared with other campuses. The College has recycling bins throughout campus including battery recycling collection containers. Onondaga also has a “carry in, carry out” policy for many classrooms, with centralized recycling and trash bins located in hallways rather than classrooms in order to significantly reduce the need for plastic liners. The College is also phasing out paper towels in restrooms across campus by installing electric hand dryers in order to reduce resource consumption. Onondaga also established an end of the year residence hall move out program that allows students to donate unwanted goods to local charities instead of throwing away the items in the trash.

Onondaga’s print management initiative has decreased waste by implementing a student print quota that limits the number of free prints students receive each semester. This initiative significantly reduces the amount of paper used on campus. The College also composts pre-consumer food waste from the cafeteria. The food scraps are transported to a nearby composting facility administered by the Onondaga County Resource Recovery Agency where they are recycled into a natural fertilizer instead of going to an incinerator or landfill. 

In addition to the College’s efforts in greening campus operations, Onondaga is working to teach students about sustainability in the classroom. The College received a grant in 2007 from the New York State Foundation for Science, Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR) to develop sustainability-related academic programs and workforce training. This funding supported the expansion of sustainability-focused curriculum in the Automotive Technology, Environmental Technology, and Architectural Technology degree programs. Each of these programs has been actively working to integrate sustainability concepts into their courses. The Automotive Technology program includes instruction on alternative fuel vehicles such as natural gas, hybrid, and electric vehicle technologies. The Environmental Technology program includes coursework covering topics such as renewable energy, bio-materials, and waste management. The Architectural Technology program has successfully integrated green building and sustainable design principles throughout many courses in the department. Onondaga also developed sustainability-related courses, such as Introduction to Sustainability, through the Interdisciplinary Studies Department. 

Onondaga is also working to teach students about sustainability outside of the classroom. The College installed a series of interactive educational displays in Ferrante Hall in order to teach students about environmental health topics. The installation includes a living green wall featuring live plants and educational content highlighting ways that plants contribute to environmental health. The signage also includes information on environmentally related careers and Onondaga’s sustainability initiative. The series also includes an Energy Dashboard that displays real-time energy consumption for the building. The Energy Dashboard shows electricity and natural gas consumption, allowing viewers to compare the building’s energy usage with other campus buildings and the previous week’s energy utilization.

The College sponsors a number of educational events to raise awareness about sustainability on campus. Onondaga’s Office of Sustainability and Environmental Health and Safety partners with academic departments and the Whole Earth Club, a student environmental organization, to host a number of guest speakers for Earth Day, Campus Sustainability Day, and other sustainability focused events. The College also organized Bike to Onondaga Day in conjunction with national Bike to Work Day in order to raise awareness about biking as a sustainable, healthy form of transportation. 

In response to the educational efforts of students, the Onondaga Community College Foundation has invested a portion of their endowment in a sustainable investment fund. After an extensive review, the Foundation board established the fund, which includes human rights and environmental criteria in its investment strategy. This initiative is consistent with national efforts to develop fossil fuel free investments for college and university endowments.

Onondaga is also working to promote sustainability in the community. Onondaga has participated in a number of local sustainability initiatives such as the NY Prize micro-grid feasibility study to explore developing a community micro-grid to improve the resilience and sustainability of the community’s electricity supply, the Central New York Electric Vehicle Charging Station Plan to explore ways of improving electric vehicle infrastructure, and the City of Syracuse sustainability planning process.

Onondaga completed a campus wide sustainability assessment using the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. The College received a STARS Silver rating in 2012, demonstrating progress on sustainability in areas related to education, operations, administration, and engagement. The STARS program allows the College to benchmark Onondaga’s efforts against peer institutions and track performance in key sustainability areas over time. 

Onondaga was also included in the 2015 edition of The Princeton Review Guide to 353 Green Colleges. The green guide profiles colleges with exceptional commitments to sustainability. The College was selected because of its many environmental initiatives such as achieving LEED Gold certification for both the SRC Arena and Events Center and the Academic II building, implementing programs to reduce waste and promote recycling, utilizing renewable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and incorporating the concept of sustainability into the curriculum.

SUSTAINABILITY

Charge: 
The All-University Committee on Sustainability will assist the University in monitoring its relationship with the environment and in establishing sustainability as a fundamental consideration in meeting the varied and complex needs of our growing campus.  The committee will encourage campus improvements in sustainability by identifying and promoting, as appropriate, private sector and higher education institutional best practices and new sustainability technologies. The committee will work with University administrative, academic and academic support units as well as faculty, students, staff, and administrators to stimulate discussion and ideas to facilitate the adoption of practices, policies and projects designed to improve the future environmental, social and economic sustainability of the campus community. 
The committee shall develop a sustainability vision statement for the University.  This vision should be broadly applicable to both the University’s infrastructure and its operational services.  This vision should underscore the role of sustainability as a critical University value in reducing the environmental impact and maximizing efficiency of its operational services, facilities and grounds keeping, as wells as its classroom and academic support activities.  Further, the vision statement should provide a framework for University community members to personally understand the importance of adopting sustainable activities such as recycled materials use, water conservation, energy efficiencies, or commitment to public transportation.   


The committee shall review existing University administrative, academic and academic support policies and practices related to issues of sustainability.  This review should assess campus compliance with CSU, state, and federal sustainability laws, regulations, and codes and evaluate the current state of sustainability best practices in higher education and private sectors. This review could include a “sustainability audit” assessing campus facilities, utilities use, infrastructure development, operations and curricula. A product of this review would be the development of a sustainability plan for the campus to educate and involve faculty, staff and students on sustainability actions they can take at the University and elsewhere.  The plan would lead to initiation of a set of clearly articulated campus sustainability goals that are measurable and with timelines to achieve those goals. 

Sustainability concerns as set out in the newly adopted Campus Master Plan should be considered as a basic foundation of these goals.  The committee should elicit ideas and suggestions from the campus community of faculty, students, staff, and administrators.


The committee will assist the campus community to develop and implement strategies to achieve the campus sustainability goals.   Such strategies might include the encouragement of departmental level reviews leading to modification or initiation of new practices, processes, services, policies, and/or the adoption of new sustainability technologies or products.  Other strategies might include soliciting, evaluating and recommending campus sustainability policies and practices that might best be implemented administratively or by local mandate.  The committee will seek in this way to encourage active campus cooperation at all levels to achieve sustainability goals and reduce the University’s environmental impact.

--The annual recycling event lets employees, students and our surrounding neighbors drop off their hard-to-recycle items for free. 

--An innovative heat recovery project captures waste heat from the pool area exhaust and preheats incoming fresh air and swimming pool water. By “recycling” this waste heat, the system cuts annual CO2 emissions by 1.8 million pounds and reduces our energy bill by $82,000.  

--Seven new gas boilers heat water and send it into an underground loop that, in turn, heats the air and water of five buildings. This system reduces our buildings’ carbon output by 18% and our annual energy bill by $138,000

The timeless values of St. Vincent de Paul (1581-1660), the patron saint of Christian charity and founder of the Vincentian community, inspire St. John’s Vincentian teachings and policy on sustainability. As a Vincentian university, St. John’s emphasizes respect for the individual, service to the needy, human solidarity and adherence to the belief that giving of one’s self along with conservation of natural resources on which life depends, helps build a more sustainable future.

Consequently, a St. John’s education encompasses both academic study including local and global environmental issues along with direct, shared experience in helping those less fortunate. For example, our curriculum includes ""academic centers of excellence"" that emphasize research into the mechanisms of sustainable global development and social justice. What’s more, we actively involve students in volunteering, mentoring and ""service learning"" programs that extend across our campuses and around the world.

The following statements affirm St. John’s commitment in building a more sustainable future through service, learning and environmental stewardship:

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

We continually monitor municipal solid waste and seek ways to reduce, re-use and re-buy using the guidelines of our partnerships with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, New York City agencies and the New York State Association for Reduction, Reuse and Recycling.
We continually monitor energy and water consumption and seek ways to conserve that will engage the entire campus community.

ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION

By working with faculty and the Sustainability Committee members, we continue to develop and expand our curriculum to provide our students with in classroom and out of classroom education and experiences that link environmental awareness to the student’s educational discipline.
We seek to support scholarship that advances our understanding and practice of sustainability.
We foster individual and institutional environmental responsibility across the entire campus community.

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE

We seek ways to partner with local communities, farmers, businesses, governments and non-profit organizations that share the interest in building a more sustainable future.
We assist St. John’s Bread & Life and other non-governmental organizations that seek to provide basic services that feed body, mind and spirit.
We support student government, student clubs and student worker initiatives that focus on changing the culture to build a more sustainable future.
In adopting this policy, St. John’s further acknowledges its leadership and commitment to the practical application of sustainability by:

Integrating sustainable practices into the daily administration and operation of the University.
Providing a voice for sustainability in the development of strategic planning and capital expenditures.
Encouraging the University community to build upon this policy statement by identifying opportunities, formulating strategies, and implementing initiatives to further the move toward building a more sustainable future.

There have been numerous activities and substantive accomplishments from Stanford's various sustainability committees. A sample of major achievements is provided below, but a record of SWG meeting agendas can be found online (http://sustainable.stanford.edu/swg_agendas). 

SUSTAINABILITY 3.0 STRATEGIC PLANNING
A group of faculty, staff, and student leaders initiated Sustainability 3.0 in June 2011 with the plan to deliver a strategic blueprint for the future of sustainability at Stanford. The Sustainability 3.0 process seeks to identify and map a shared and actionable vision for sustainability at Stanford over the next five to ten years, building on the Initiative on Environment and Sustainability that launched in October 2003 and the formalization of Sustainable Stanford that began in 2007.

Major goals stemming from the Sustainability 3.0 effort include leading sustainability by example through on- and off-campus actions, and maintaining a global influence through sustainability in research, education, and operations. To achieve these goals, the planning committee has unveiled four key strategies:

(1) Ensure that sustainability is a top and lasting priority for Stanford University in research, teaching, and action.
(2) Establish clear policies for implementing sustainability in every part of campus: implement, monitor, and achieve.
(3) Educate and train the Stanford community to work towards sustainability goals and build a fully committed and engaged community.
(4) Reach beyond Stanford. Influence sustainability research, education, and action beyond the university.

",True,"Administrators, faculty, staff, and students throughout the university are working to research and implement sustainability. Following are the key dimensions of the collaborative governance model for sustainability at Stanford.

STUDENT SUSTAINABILITY WORKING GROUP (2015)
Stanford students have a long-standing history of sustainability leadership.  From starting the campus recycling program in 1978 to petitioning fossil fuel divestment from in 2015, students have proven their ability to set ambitious goals and build partnerships to achieve them. Beginning fall 2015, Office of Sustainability formed a Student Sustainability Working Group (SSWG) to support the culture of student innovation and collaboration on campus. 

Every month SSWG brings together students, academic staff, and sustainability staff to share updates, solicit project feedback, and brainstorm partnership opportunities. By increasing communication and project support among organizations, SSWG will help ensure a cohesive approach to sustainability at Stanford. 

PROVOST'S COMMITTEE ON SUSTAINABILITY (2012)
An executive committee of deans, institute leads and senior campus leadership, the Provost's Committee on Sustainability began formally convening starting in the 2012-13 academic year. The committee facilitates collaboration across schools, institutes, the Office of Sustainability, and students; exerts leadership across campus; brings campus-wide sustainability issues to the attention of the Provost and the President; and implements leadership recommendations. Formation of the Provost's Committee is the outcome of one of the many key recommendations derived from the year-long strategic exercise, Sustainability 3.0, unveiled in May 2012.

SUSTAINABILITY WORKING GROUP (2006)
The Sustainability Working Group (SWG) prepares policy and program recommendations to advance and implement sustainability practices on campus. Goals include:

(1) Continuously improve Stanford’s leadership in demonstrating environmental sustainability in campus operations.
(2) Use faculty, staff and student expertise in the evolving field of sustainability.
(3) Advance opportunities for hands-on sustainability-related learning and service in the campus community.

SWG, chaired by the director of the Office of Sustainability, meets the first Thursday of every month and involves representatives from all parts of the university. 

The Office of Sustainability connects campus organizations and entities and works collaboratively with them to steer sustainability initiatives to fulfill President Hennessy’s vision that sustainability will ""become a core value in everything we do."" The Office works on long-range sustainability analysis and planning, evaluations and reporting, communication and outreach, academic integration, conservation behavior and training, and sustainability governance strategy.

SUSTAINABILITY WORKING TEAMS (2008)
The Sustainability Working Teams, assembled in 2008, develop program recommendations, assess progress, and help implement policy recommendations in major operational areas related to sustainability. The teams are composed of campus subject matter experts, representatives from key Stanford community groups, and individuals with authority to take action in the relevant operational areas. Each team activates when a specific initiative is underway and may be dormant when a given project has been implemented.","The membership of Stanford's Sustainability Working group and Sustainability Working Teams are too numerous to list here, but include faculty, staff, students, and key senior administrators. Contact information for the chairs of each committee can be found on the Sustainable Stanford website (http://sustainable.stanford.edu/governance).

Membership of Stanford's Student Sustainability Working group includes leadership of student sustainability clubs, staff and faculty, and other community members interested in helping to further sustainability initiatives on campus.",http://sustainable.stanford.edu/governance,True,"Sustainability and Energy Management (SEM), a department within Land, Buildings & Real Estate (LBRE), leads initiatives in campus infrastructure and programs in energy and climate, water, transportation, green buildings, and sustainable information technology, as well as various special initiatives. All of SEM's projects are centered around the long-term sustainability of the campus, and many of the employees within each of SEM's various groups focus exclusively on sustainability as part of their daily work. For example, the Office of Sustainability is housed in SEM and connects campus organizations and entities, and works collaboratively with them to steer sustainability initiatives and reach milestones. The office works on long-range sustainability analysis and planning, assessment and reporting, sustainability governance strategy, conservation behavior and training, communication and outreach, and academic integration. Complementing operational efficiency measures undertaken by campus facilities managers, distinct and education-oriented programmatic initiatives spearheaded by the Office of Sustainability make sustainability more actionable and visible throughout the campus community.

New in 2015, Stanford's Office of Sustainability brought in a Business Systems Manager and Sustainability Analyst to facilitate the applicability of Stanford's Utilities, Metering, Billing, Reporting and Sustainability (UMBRS) project among the Department of Sustainability & Energy Management. To date, the UMBRS project has allowed the creation of a central database that houses data from all utility meters on campus. The new Business Systems positions in the Office of Sustainability will ensure that all users in the Department of Sustainability & Energy Management are able to use this meter data to benchmark and improve their sustainability and conservation programs and will facilitate sustainability reporting across utility sectors. 

Please note, SEM employs 95 staff members, including 5 who work in the Office of Sustainability and 21 who work directly on sustainability initiatives within other SEM groups. However, there are hundreds of other professionals throughout the Stanford community involved with sustainability projects in their daily work, some of whom are listed on the staff page of the Sustainable Stanford website.

http://www.esf.edu/nativepeoples/NativeEarth.htm 
- Composting: helped re-organize ESF's composting program, to have greater integration and cooperation between students and ESF's Campus Grounds. ",True,"A Campus Climate Change Committee (CCCC) has been made up of ESF faculty, staff, administrators, and students. The committee met two times per semester, and reviewed and approved Student Sustainability Fund projects, and reviewed and provided feedback on ESF's progress towards sustainability.

The goals of the CCCC are to: Continue and increase efforts to foster awareness and involvement with sustainability and climate action projects among the campus community, publicize and expand sustainability efforts to the local community and beyond, closely monitor and adjust plans, progress, and goals as necessary, and continue growing ESF’s portfolio of sustainability efforts.

Starting in the summer of 2015, the College has been transitioning from the CCCC to a more inclusive Sustainability Committee. An ad-hoc group of College representatives has met since that time and it is expected that the new Sustainability Committee will be fully formed by the end of March 2016.","(As of February 2015, after which a new Sustainability Director was hired, leading to future planned changes in committee structure and goals)

",True,"Sustainability Curriculum Coordination Subcommittee

Charge

1.        Consulting with departments, centers, and student groups on campus to assemble what the College is planning to do for the coming five years to continue or expand educational offerings concerning sustainability as well as to continue or expand faculty and student research efforts and creative activities that relate to the sustainability or other environmental issues.  They will also collect information concerning efforts by the campus to seek external funding for sustainability initiatives that relate to curricular or co-curricular activities.  

2.        Using the information about campus plans for the coming five years, draft a strategic plan for curriculum development drawing together the campus plans within the context of the President’s Climate Commitment’s goal of making “climate neutrality and sustainability a part of the curriculum and other educational experience for all students.”  This strategic plan will identify the progress that is expected to be made on integrating sustainability across the curriculum and making it a part of the educational experience of all students and will seek to provide information exchange on best practices and to find opportunities for synergistic interactions between campus initiatives.  It will also identify the areas of greatest need where there are opportunities for reaching the largest number of students not currently being served by the campus efforts.  This strategic plan should be submitted to the Faculty Senate and to the President’s Cabinet for comment and discussion upon completion.  Its major findings should be presented at the first Joint Chairs Council meeting in the semester after its completion.

3.        Assessing the success of efforts undertaken over the last year to continue or increase access to sustainability education including the number of students served as well as an assessment of student learning outcomes where possible.  As part of the this effort, the committee will consider what measures of assessment would be most valuable in gauging the success of curricular and co-curricular initiatives as well as the success of student and faculty research or other creative activities.  As such, the committee will work with the office of Institutional Research and Assessment to ensure that the needed data is gathered to allow these assessments to be conducted.  In addition, drawing on its assessment efforts, the committee will also make itself available to provide comments and suggestions on proposed sustainability curriculum initiatives upon request of the proposing faculty.

4.        Preparing an annual report including a review of the past year’s efforts, an assessment of their successes and areas for potential improvement, and a discussion of the major efforts envisioned for the coming year. This will be used both as a stand-alone document and in preparing the annual report from the Climate Action Strategic Planning Committee.  Annual reports in years two and four of each five year strategic plan should include any recommended changes, additions, or subtractions to the curriculum strategic plan that arise as conditions change.

Climate Action Planning Committee's Climate Plan Financial Tracking and Coordination Subcommittee:

Charge:
1.        Consulting with departments and divisions on campus to assemble what the College is planning to do for the coming five years to fund actions related to climate plan including how much money they are budgeting, from what sources, and how much external support they plan/hope to seek (NYSERDA grants, New York Power Authority, etc.).
2.        Using the information about campus plans for the coming five years, draft a strategic plan for finance outlining basis and philosophy of current strategy and their assessment of likely surpluses or shortfalls based on the projected needs from the most recent version of the Climate Action Plan.  If likely shortfalls are identified for the coming five years, the strategic plan should include recommendations for how the shortfall could be filled and who should be approached internally to begin looking for the extra monies needed.  This strategic plan would be submitted to President’s Cabinet for approval and presented to the campus at a public meeting.
3.        Tracking of what monies are actually being spent on the sustainability initiatives outlined in the economic analysis of the most current climate action plan each year including collecting the internal reporting forms recommended in the current action plan.  This will require working with Facilities and the Physical Plant to design a strategy to split out costs from facilities projects that support sustainability in a way that is reasonably quick and reproducible from job to job.
4.        Preparing the annual financial report including monies spent comparison to projections in the most recent financial strategic plan, and comment on the likely implications of deficits or surpluses to funding targets over the remainder of the five-year plan.  This will be used both as a stand-alone document and in preparing the annual report from the Climate Action Strategic Planning Committee.  Annual reports in years two and four of each five year strategic plan should include any recommended changes, additions, or subtractions to the strategic plan that arise as conditions change.

Garden Advisory Group Charge:

Responsibilities
•        Create and help maintain gardens and edible landscaping in consultation with Facilities Management.
•        Integrate garden and edible landscaping planning into the college’s Sustainability, Climate Action, and Facilities Master Plans in consultation with Facilities Management.

The office spearheads a number of major programs and initiatives and works across all three Tufts campuses.  Major accomplishments include the following:

The Office of Sustainability convened and organized a Transportation Working Group, and the Program Director sat on the Fleet Management and student driver sub-group. The Sustainability Program Director also chaired the working group, which created a Transportation Demand Management Plan completed in Spring 2015.

The Office of Sustainability has regularly offered an undergraduate course “Environmental Action: Shifting from Saying to Doing,” which empowers students to take sustainability action on campus.  The course was historically taught through the Ex-College but is now offered through the Environmental Studies Department and Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning (UEP). (http://sustainability.tufts.edu/programs/for-credit-courses-from-the-office-of-sustainability/)

The Office of Sustainability launched a Green Office Certification program in FY12.  The program is designed to recognize, support, and promote offices that are engaging in sustainable practices.  There are four levels of certification, allowing offices to be recognized for their current conservation actions while still providing a goal to work toward.  The program was updated and relaunched in Summer 2014.  (http://sustainability.tufts.edu/programs/green-office-certification/)

In 2012, the office introduced the Tufts Eco-Tour, a self-guided tour of the Medford/Somerville campus that encourages community members to learn about sustainability initiatives at Tufts.  The tour is made up of signs on buildings across campus with QR codes that can be scanned with a smartphone to provide participants with information on university initiatives and milestones related to sustainability at each tour stop.  (https://sites.tufts.edu/ecotour/)

The Office of Sustainability began developing a database of student projects related to Tufts’ campuses, primarily sustainability-related projects. The database allows students to upload their projects online and may eventually be integrated with the Tisch Library catalog.  

The Office of Sustainability has seen successful expansions of both its Eco-Reps program for students and Eco-Ambassadors program for staff and faculty members (please refer to credits EN-1 and EN-6 for more information about and accomplishments of the programs).  

In conjunction with other sustainability-focused groups at Tufts, such as the Tufts Institute of the Environment (TIE), the Eco-Reps, and the Tufts Sustainability Collective, the office has organized a number of sustainability events, including Earth Day/Week, Bike Week, Car-Free Week, and Zero Waste Week.  

The Office of Sustainability maintains a website, blog, Twitter account, Your Tube page, Facebook page, Tumblr site, and newsletter.  The office also creates and disseminates a wide variety of publications and other sustainability resources, including transportation brochures.  In 2013, the office introduced a bike map that shows locations of bike racks, terrain elevation, bike-friendly routes, and bike safety tips and is designed to foster biking on campus.

University at Buffalo,2016-01-19,2016-01-19 10:15:40,jlk47@buffalo.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"As a public research institution, our model of sustainability focuses on finding solutions to global challenges through research, educating individuals about these challenges, setting the bar high for sustainability in our own operations, and sharing our experiences and partnering with the external community.  Through an integrated and collaborative approach, UB has become a leader in sustainability in higher education and was recently ranked within the top 50 green colleges and universities in the nation. Our commitment spans over 35 years—from the origins of the environmental movement at Love Canal to the innovative operational measures we take that continue to save the university millions of dollars a year.  We strive to evolve, build resilience and minimize our environmental footprint on the future as most potently illustrated by our aggressive commitment to become climate neutral by 2030.  

Cultivating the next generation of sustainability leaders through teaching and research
Providing exceptional teaching and innovative research is at the heart of what we do. With over 1/3 of our 30,000 student body in more than 330 sustainability courses, infusing sustainability across our curriculum has become integral to fostering the next generation of leaders who are equipped to address global challenges. In 2013, The Sustainability Academy was established as one of UB’s innovative living/learning communities allowing students to deepen their academic understanding of sustainability, pursue sustainability initiatives in their own lives, engage with university wide sustainability efforts, and connect with opportunities to positively impact the greater Buffalo community through internships and service learning. The sustainability academy facilitates student involvement in collaborative problem solving, addressing some of the most vexing problems of our day. 

Building on a long history of environmental research, UB recently launched RENEW (Research and Education in eNergy, Environment and Water)—an ambitious, university-wide, interdisciplinary research institute that focuses on the most difficult and complex environmental issues, as well as the social and economic issues with which they are intertwined.  One of the most expansive initiatives launched in recent years by the university, RENEW will harness the expertise of more than 100 faculty across the university, with the goal of hiring 20 more outstanding faculty with expertise in such areas as aquatic ecology, pollution law, behavioral economics, environmental planning, community health and energy/environmental systems. The institute’s interdisciplinary focus has already seen the launch of four diverse “seed” projects that explore the development of cost-effective desalination processes, the potential for great lakes offshore wind energy, tracking emerging sources of water pollution, and examining how the demand for renewable energy is affecting farmland. 

In 2007, UB demonstrated exemplary leadership by setting the bar high in our own operations when President Simpson signed the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment.  A subsequent Climate Action Plan, created in 2009 under the direction of UB’s Environmental Stewardship Committee, provides a roadmap for identifying and implementing opportunities to reduce our environmental impacts while continuing to grow, ultimately striving to be climate neutral by 2030.  Over the first few years of implementation the university has witnessed a 9.4% reduction in its energy use index (as measured by NYPA) and is moving forward with a host of carbon reduction strategies. 

Our early commitment to green construction and sustainable design laid the foundation for five new LEED Gold buildings—all opening within one year of another. William R. Greiner Hall opened as SUNY’s first LEED Gold residence hall and continues to demonstrate the potential for student living to be highly-efficient, well-designed and inspirational places to live, work, and play. 

Monitoring our building performance and resource use is an important part of our ongoing sustainable operations strategy. As part of a NYPA project, over 210 power meters have been installed at UB. The new internet based “smart” power meters allow UB to closely observe and manipulate power consumption within each building. To reinforce this commitment and further engage the university community, the UB Sustainability Dashboard was launched last year and provides real-time energy, water, steam and natural gas usage in an online, interactive platform.

In addition, the University has been a leader in purchasing renewable energy at a rate of 35% of its total consumption.  This action has garnered it top national recognition by the Environmental Protection Agency as the 11th largest green power user among U.S. colleges and universities for the past several years.  These activities are woven around the University’s continuing emphasis to reduce energy usage where possible in its buildings and grounds through greater energy control and the deployment of rapidly changing technologies. As one of many examples, in 2014 an energy conservation project was completed in a student dorm that reduced electrical usage by 997,838 kwh/year and 1,145MMBtu of natural gas.  

Last year, UB also initiated an innovative first-of-its kind bike share program that provides GPS-enabled bikes (powered by a solar panel on the bike) that can be located and borrowed using your smartphone. This coupled with policies that encourage car-pooling, provide charging stations for electric vehicles, and promote a culture of biking and walking have helped us move toward more sustainable transportation options for our students, faculty, staff and visitors who travel to UB’s three campuses and throughout the community each day. 

While reducing our carbon footprint is essential, the university is also firmly committed to activities that move it away from creating waste on our campuses.  In 2014 A Zero Waste Task Force was convened to focus on the problem. Recommendations from the task force included; forming a permanent Zero Waste Council, completing a University waste stream analysis, developing a comprehensive recyclers list for more complex commodities and increasing recycling and composting at sporting and special events. The University is continuing to build on its existing programs for recycling (over 1.5M pounds a year) and reuse through programs such as RecycleMania, an increasingly robust program for recycling textiles, electronics recycling, personal records shredding events, an aggressive composting initiative that eliminates 100% of pre and post consumer waste in our dining halls and a very successful pilot program at UB Stadium in 2014 that eliminated nearly all game day waste. 

We appreciate the importance of experiential learning and strive to support our students as they explore ways to weave sustainability and environmental stewardship into their everyday lives. Last year, UB students completed 42,455 hours of sustainability related service in our region and beyond by participating in programs like the Louisiana Bayou Alternative Winter Break trip and an innovative environmental internship program with 100 environmental organizations throughout Western New York. 

We strongly believe our work doesn’t stop at the campus borders. The university works in partnership with sustainability-centered community organizations to help bolster the sustainability conversation in Western New York and we appreciate the importance of supporting a strong and resilient Buffalo-Niagara. UB has provided key community leadership (recently earning the 2014 Best Collaboration Award by USGBC) to create, implement and provide ongoing strong leadership and collaboration to the Western New York Environmental Alliance (an umbrella group that strengthens the work of our region’s environmental community) and the Sustainable Business Roundtable (the region’s green business group). We also believe in the power of sharing our success (and failures) and thus have developed a dynamic sustainability communications portal that provides a one stop shop for “all things sustainability” and provides a jumping off point for our social media vehicles and the monthly UB Sustainability News. 

UB benefits from an equally engaged and civic-minded faculty and professional staff. Each year the Professional Staff Senate brings together 30 local and national businesses and community groups to host the UB Sustainable Living Fair, which engages students, faculty and staff with ways to lead greener lives both at work and at home. Faculty, like Joe Gardella, are finding creative ways to take their environmental expertise right into Buffalo neighborhoods, working with students and residents to test for environmental contaminants in homes, playgrounds and backyards.  The dynamic, sustainably- focused regional planning effort, One Region Forward, demonstrates the incredible outcomes that can be achieved when we leverage our human capital both on and off campus. The initiative, which was coordinated by UB’s Regional Institute in conjunction with partner organizations, engaged more than 5,000 citizens and 700 organizations through innovative capacity building programs over a three year period.  

The University at Buffalo’s 750-kilowatt Solar Strand, brought to life by world-renowned artist Walter Hood, reflects a transformative vision that moves beyond obtaining carbon neutrality and reducing our footprint.  It welcomes students, faculty staff and community members to UB’s campus through a connected and cultural natural landscape, designed to be one of the most publicly accessible energy sites in the world.  Like higher education, the strand is multidimensional; merging teaching, learning, art, research, sustainability and community engagement into a complex and powerful resource that will be a model for future development.

As the most accessible solar landscape in the world, which has generated 24 million kwh to date, the Solar Strand was recently listed on the 2014 Wall Street Journal Best of Architecture list. It has been actively promoted as a learning destination and social venue and played host to the 2013 Buffalo Niagara Earth Day celebration, UB’s Bring Your Child to Work Day workshop, Leadership Niagara and many others.  We are currently partnering with Verizon to create an interactive, free-choice mobile app which will serve as a self-guided tours for visitors to the strand.

At 140 feet wide and 1,250 feet long, the array’s 3,200 American-made panels will prevent 400 tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere annually. 
Looking ahead: Creating a culture of integrated sustainability thinking
While we are proud of the road we’ve travelled, we want to build on our history of environmental stewardship and recognize that sustainability is not a goal to achieve, but rather a strategy for creating a better future.  As we evolve our model of sustainability we’re focused on embedding a culture of sustainable thinking and practice deep into all aspects of day-to-day activities and long-term ambitions. 

Building on success of the Environmental Stewardship Committee, we’re in the process of creating a cross-cutting university wide Sustainability Congress that is led by a committed Stewardship Council.  As part of this process we’re building off the UB Climate Action Plan and creating a new sustainability strategy and plan that incorporates best practice from our national peers through the Sustainability, Tracking Assessment Rating System (STARS).   

As an institution of higher education, we are greatly appreciative of the opportunity we have to demonstrate ongoing sustainability leadership through our mission of educating the next generation, finding new solutions through our research and partnering with our community and our region. We strive to evolve and adapt, all the while sharing our stories of success and challenges in an effort to encourage others as they endeavor on their own sustainability journey’s. We believe sustainability is inherently collaborative and are inspired by the efforts of others both locally and globally as we collectively work toward creating a better future through sustainability.

",True,"In November 2007, the Environmental Stewardship Committee (ESC) was created to direct UB’s efforts toward fulfilling our commitment of achieving climate neutrality and ensuring that UB is moving toward sustainability.

Since then, the ESC created, submitted and began implementation of a Climate Action Plan aimed at reducing UB’s net carbon emissions to zero by 2030.

The Environmental Stewardship Committee was constructed according to one basic principle: that individuals representing units of the university with the budget authority and operational capacity to implement a climate action plan should be intimately involved in creating, managing and monitoring the plan.

Building on the success of the Environmental Stewardship Committee, in early 2015 the university reconstituted the ESC to better embed sustainable thinking, practices and decision-making throughout the university via an integrated sustainability strategy.  The new university wide Stewardship Committee reports to the president and is co-chaired by Robert Shibley, dean of the School of Architecture and Planning, and Ryan McPherson, chief sustainability officer.  The committee conssists of key campus leaders and leverages four new subcommittees focusing on research, teaching, operations and engagement (the ESC was primarily focused on operations).  The subcommittees, which are tasked with developing goals, priorities and focus areas for UB’s broader sustainability plan, are chaired by:

Research – Amit Goyal, director of RENEW (Research and Education in eNergy, Environment and Water) and the Empire Innovation Professor in the departments of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Physics.

Teaching – Andrew M. Stott, dean of undergraduate education and professor of English.

Operations – Kelly Hayes McAlonie, interim associate vice provost and director of UB’s Capital Planning Group.

Engagement – Domenic “Dom” Licata, instructional support technician and instructor in the Department of Art, and incoming chair of the Professional Staff Senate.

In addition, the Stewardship committee also holds multiple Sustainability Congresses throughout the year to garner greater stakeholder engagement from across the campus.

Below is a list of accomplishments from FY 2014/2015

Water:
•	While UC Santa Barbara has already met the UC wide policy measures, new goals have been set in place to show campus solidarity with the community of Goleta. UCSB has committed to reducing potable water consumption 12% by March 2016. If accomplished, these reductions between June 2014 and March 2016 would account for more than 19 million gallons of potable water saved. 
•	LabRATS (sustainable lab group) has secured funding to pilot new condensers in several labs that will operate on a “closed loop” recirculating system in which water is recycled and reused. With funding for 64 of the new units, UCSB expects to save 2.3% of its 12% goal with that effort alone.
•	Water savings contests were held between all Residential Halls and saved an average of over 10% during the 4 week contest.
•	Aerators in 5 buildings were replaced, dropping average faucet use over 70% (0.5 gpm vs 2.2 gpm)
•	Use of reclaimed water was expanded to the San Rafael Residential Hall lawn area. The reclaimed water line was also brought under the UCEN road to the last part of the Channel Island 5 buildings (Santa Rosa north/Creative Studies).  The next step is to connect to irrigation for that area in 2015.
Food:
•	The 2014-2015 sustainable food procurement assessment for the UCSB Dining Commons calculated 35% sustainable food purchases. This year, 45% of total produce purchases were grown and distributed within 250 miles of campus and 37% within 150 miles of campus. Additionally, we were able to purchase 30% organic produce. 
•	We collaborated with UC Agriculture and Natural Resource Division’s Nutrition Policy Institute on a survey of students at all ten UC campuses to evaluate food security.
•	In collaboration with the AS Food Bank, we hosted two public forums on sustainable foods to engage students, staff, and faculty.
•	The AS Food Bank, in collaboration with students and other stakeholders throughout the state, hosted the CA Higher Education Food Summit in January 2015.
•	The UC Global Food Initiative Fellows completed a study on effective messaging for reducing food waste in the UCSB Dining Commons.  
•	We launched the Edible Campus Program through a coalition of UCSB Sustainability, Associated Students Food Bank, and the Department of Public Worms. The kick-off event featured Jack and Kim Johnson and was a highlight of Alumni Weekend. Approval was secured from UCSB Environmental Health and Safety to ensure that food grown through the first phase of this program (Potted Citrus Trees) can be distributed via the AS Food Bank.
Waste:
•	Associated Students Recycling launched an indoor compost program, placing bins in multiple department lounge and kitchen spaces where they may be accessible to students, staff, and faculty. The bins are managed entirely by student staff, and the program is an important step in bringing UCSB closer to its goal of zero landfill waste by 2020. AS Recycling hopes to expand the program this fall and eventually have bins available campus-wide.
•	We won the Best Practice Award for Innovative Waste Reduction at the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference for optimizing waste management services through stakeholder engagement by:
a.	Removing over 350 landfill receptacles through engagement with custodial staff
b.	Supplying custodial staff with blue liners for recycling bins and new carts to allow them to service the recycling waste stream easier
c.	The construction of three new 4x8 vermicompost bins
d.	Re-engineering recycling collection bikes for ease of use and repair
e.	Our Zero Waste Week Outreach Project – students and staff carried around all waste produced in clear backpacks 
f.	Purchasing over 20 hand-dryers to replace paper towel dispensers in buildings throughout campus
g.	Purchasing and introducing over 300 recycling and landfill receptacles to upgrade the indoor waste infrastructure throughout campus
Energy:
•	UCSB was awarded a Best Practice Awards at the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference for the Chilled Water Loop Optimization project. Eight separate chiller plants provide chilled water to the loop, for which the staff developed methods for balancing power for compressors, as well as peripheral components such as pumps and cooling towers. The result of the project is an energy savings of 2.1 million kilowatt-hours each year, or 2.5 percent of UCSB’s total electricity use. That’s a cost savings of $235,000 per year. Southern California Edison provided an incentive of $511,000 to support the project.
•	In 2010 UCSB students voted by referendum to fund the construction of a 425kW solar array which was completed in late 2014 and which will generate 650,000 kWh of clean energy per year. The array supports the Student Resource Building and the many Student Affairs departments providing student services which are housed there.
Built Environment: 
•	UCSB piloted and successfully executed its first LEED Lab, a year-long multidisciplinary immersion course in which students facilitate the LEED Existing Buildings process on a campus building (Student Resource Building) with the goal of LEED certification. 
•	Several new buildings were completed and in the process of earning LEED certification: North Campus Recreation Building (tracking LEED NC Silver, 2014), Santa Cruz Residence Hall (tracking LEED CI Gold, 2015), and SNARL Classroom (tracking LEED Gold, 2015).
Transportation:
•	UCSB and the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District came together in a partnership in developing a new Goleta-Isla Vista-UCSB route — Line 38. This new bus line will be free for UCSB students, faculty, and staff who have photo IDs, and the line could be in service as early as the fall of 2016. There will be enhanced service on two existing routes, the 12X and 24X, which will increase service hours and reduce wait times beginning in summer 2015. 
•	In spring 2015, UC Santa Barbara’s application was selected by the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District for $34k in grant funding toward the installation of 8 Level 2 electric vehicle charging stations.

•	Chancellor’s Sustainability Challenge – The first Chancellor’s Sustainability Challenge was focused on waste reduction. The Challenge resulted in over 700 personal pledges and led to the advancement of many infrastructure related projects including a zero waste collection model (which includes custodial collection of waste, recycling and compost), with a pilot at McHenry beginning in the fall. A comparison of 2011 and 2014 waste assessment results indicate a 12.3% reduction in food scraps and compostable paper and a 4.5% reduction in recyclable paper.

•	Academic and Operation Connection for Sustainability/ Living Lab - Developed the first Sustainability Living Lab Map, which highlights places on campus where problem-based teaching, research and applied work combine to develop actionable solutions that improve sustainability of our campus and community.

•	Academic Outreach and Engagement - Completed reporting on sustainability academics for the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System and identified 339 classes that are sustainability focused or related offered in 17 departments and 111 faculty engaged in research that relates to sustainability. We have also conducted informal interviews with faculty from key departments to identify ways we might better promote and support sustainability research and teaching.

•	Water - The SO created a student drought response team to work with stakeholders throughout campus and has also been a direct support to PPC staff in coordinating the water working group.

University of Colorado Boulder,2016-03-03,2016-03-03 07:49:49,dave.newport@colorado.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"To numerous to count. Just a smattering include:
•	Sports
o	CU was in 2008 the nation’s first NCAA Division 1 football program to transition sports events to zero waste—and has won two EPA national championships in the years since. Sustainability in sports has ballooned nationally in recent years and CU continues to lead that effort. Recently, CU has been championed by the Natural Resources Defense Council as a leader in this arena. We continue to work with many other campuses and organizations in sports sustainability.
•	Training & Engagement
o	Responding to sustained student interest, the EC assessed campus leadership programs and their inclusion of sustainability.  We planned to launch the Sustainability Immersion Leadership Training program in Fall 2012 but delayed with consideration to synergize with the Sustainable Practices Program overhaul and offerings and to condense to a one-semester program. This effort will feed from and into existing leadership and service-learning assets already present on campus, and use existing staffers’ (Director, EOC, Assoc. Director, etc) expertise to create a focused, non-credit curriculum for a select number of students. The program does not require new support from CUSG; however, this will create a national model at a time when demand for sustainability-related leadership training is rapidly growing.  We are planning to launch in Spring 2014 with recruiting in Fall 2013 provided staff resources are available.  One intended outcome of the program is to establish a training program for first and second year students who will be potential candidates for board or staff positions.  
o	The EC has actively supported the interdepartmental coordination of campus sustainability communications and outreach material.  A major focus is development of a communications strategic plan given the sheer number of departments involved and active in sustainability operations, research and education and engagement.  This plan, along with other developments, is establishing the need for continued and new training and engagement programs for all sectors of the campus community.  
•	Student Affairs Sustainability Plan
o	The Student Affairs Division at CU recently incorporated a strong sustainability goal in its strategic plan and asked the Environmental Center to lead that effort within the division. Short term this means a training program for all SA staff and students that is leveraged with existing EC programs for greater traction in residence halls and offices. Longer term, the plan calls for CU’s SA division to become a national leader in this arena—and we are well on the way to that goal.
•	Sustainability Action Teams
o	The Vice Chancellor for Adminsitration several years ago established Sustainability Action Teams (SATs) that combine personnel from across campus together to work on specific outcomes (e.g. recycling, energy, etc). Various EC staff participated on most of the SATs. The SATs also set 1-3 year performance goals to pursue and channel funds from the VCA and others into related projects. The latest goals for 2012 were all met—even though they were fairly aggressive.
•	nLab
o	The partnership between Leeds Business School Deming Center for Entrepreneurship and the Environmental Center has launched nLab—and sustainability creative crucible designed to elicit innovative ideas from all students in all majors. The EC funded the nBox part of nLab, a mobile entrepreneurship incubator. That program has already integrated several dozen students into the formative process. When nBox goes mobile in 2013 we expect that number to climb substantially.
* Recycling
With the addition of Zero Waste Goals adopted into the Campus Master Plan (90% diversion rate by 2020), CU Recycling has been vigorously working to plan and implement action items to continue to take the campus towards Zero Waste.
•	Achieving a campus diversion rate of 41%, the second highest in CU’s history (down 1% from last year)
•	Expansion of the compost pilot program to implement compost collections throughout 3 additional buildings on campus: Regent, Systems Biotech and Wolf Law. 
o	Current total buildings composting = 6
o	Compost bins have been established in all the rest rooms of these buildings, which has proven to be the most cost effective, operationally efficient method of providing central composting locations for the buildings.
•	“Can Parity” pilot program has been completed in Business, Education, Regent and Systems Biotech.  Improvements are still being made in EH&S, Wolf Law, and Norlin Library to achieve Can Parity.
o	Results will be reviewed to determine best method to expand to all buildings on campus over the next few years.
•	“Can Parity” on the outdoor waste stations at the UMC has been completed, thus achieving “Can Parity” at almost all outdoor waste stations across campus
•	The Zero Waste operations in Folsom Stadium for the home football games have been the highlight of Ralphie’s Green Stampede once again.  For the fourth year, CU Recycling has led these Zero Waste events, successfully creating a diversion rate of over 72% at each game. 
* Energy & Climate
•	You Can Turn Off Climate Change Campaign: We continue to seek out new ways to use this campaign to reach students, staff and faculty.  The newest effort is in stickers that encourage campus users to report energy and water waste. 
•	SCORE (Student and Community Outreach on Renter Efficiency): In fiscal year 2012-2013 Xcel Energy not only provided funding for a team of student employees to visit 200 homes to conduct energy assessments, but they increased their support in providing additional funds for the Greek Sustainability program described below.  The energy and water assessments of student rental properties houses include direct installation of CFLs, low-flow showerheads, sink aerators, weather stripping, window film, and hot water pipe insulation.  In addition, student employees review energy-savings habits that tenants can adopt to lower their energy bill. 
•	Greek Sustainability:  Through the generous funding of Xcel Energy we were able to significantly increase our outreach among the Greeks by hiring both a Fraternity and Sorority Greek Sustainability Coordinator, enhancing our outreach efforts to both sets of Greeks.  This duo, with the assistance of SCORE technicians, conducts energy and water assessments in the Greek houses and facilitates regular meetings with the Greek Sustainability Chairs.  Almost all houses have a Sustainability Chair that works with house residents to reduce their energy demand.  In the spring of 2013 we will conduct and energy competition, the Green Cup, among the sorority houses. 
•	Green Labs Program: CU Green Labs has had a great year of progress which can be seen by the large increase in ongoing electrical saving.  This year we are reporting an ongoing savings of 510,000 kWh/year compared to 270,000 kWh/year that was reported last year.  One of the main reasons for this large jump is that we have reached the point in our program where labs think of reaching out to CU Green Labs prior to making purchases.  As a result we have been able to have large impacts on the purchase decisions of scientists.   Other notable accomplishments include:
•	Ongoing savings of 4.2 million gallons of water/year (up 0.5 million/year from last year)
•	Unknown but significant natural gas savings (fume hood sash contest for 125 fume hoods and two autoclaves taken off house steam)
•	Total of 340 cubic yards of foam recycled since Jan 2011 (up from 130 cubic yards last year)
•	NEW THIS YEAR: Addition of pipette tip box recycling pilot with Eco-cycle– already ~1000 lbs of material collected
•	Increased presence of posters raising awareness and addressing conservation in labs (including positive feedback from labs on the positive impacts the posters are making)
•	More sharing of ULT freezers between labs than any other year
•	More conversion to more energy efficient freezer sample storage temperature (from ultra low temps to -20⁰C or room temperature) than any other year
•	35% of ULT freezers at -70⁰C instead of -80⁰C
•	Winner of National Freezer Challenge for the second year in a row
•	Notable national reputation among universities and government labs as a leader in Green Labs topics and program structure
•	Energy Green Teams: With funding from the City of Boulder, Energy Green Teams visits 1,200 residences in the Goss/Grove, Aurora and Hill neighborhoods to distribute information on energy and water conservation, CFLs, and sink aerators. While the majority of the potential conservation impacts will occur in residents’ homes, we expect many students to carry over these new learned behaviors, such as turning off lights and managing computer energy use, onto campus.
•	iCAST partnership: The International Center for Appropriate and Sustainable Technology (iCAST)was awarded a large HUD grant to conduct improvements to low-income homes.  We partnered with iCAST during the summer of 2012 to provide SCORE-like assessments for low-income housing in Boulder.  One paid student employee (funding provided by iCAST) and three volunteer interns visited over 30 homes twice to work with residents to reduce their energy use.
•	Community Based Social Marketing Analysis: This fall the Energy Outreach Team is focusing on an analysis of the residence halls.  This analysis includes identification of desired behaviors and associated barriers, focus group discussions to clarify barriers and desired incentives, campus-wide survey to determine attitudes and likeliness to adopt new behaviors, and piloting of campaign materials.  The analysis conducted this year will be useful in developing effective and impactful campaign materials for the next several years.

Notable new programs and projects
•	Green Labs EcoLeader Team Leads:  Newly hired Team Leads are graduate students who help manage and lead Lab Eco-Leaders and who work with their lab department on conservation efforts.  Since departmental or chair approval was received before offering these positions to graduate students, the positions also indirectly established social support for the CU Green Labs Program in lab departments with the leadership of those departments. Even though the first four team leads have only been in place since late November, they are already having great impact.  In the new Biotech building (JSCBB) on East campus, an educational campaign and contest managed by the JSCBB Team Lead on the importance of closing fume hood sashes for energy savings and safety began on Jan 7th for more than 125 fume hoods in that building.  In Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EBio), information about EBio IT conservation efforts related to research & classroom computers are being spread and shared with other research departments as a result of initial efforts of the EBio Team Lead.  In Chemistry, two autoclaves (large consumers) are being turned off and acetone recycling is being explored as a result of efforts of the Chemistry Team Lead.  And in Environmental Engineering, the addition of foam & pipette tip box recycling for this department is being worked on as a result of the efforts of the Env. Eng. Team Lead. 
•	Dining Partnership: Late in the summer of 2012 we participated in the full day training with all Dining staff in which we did a presentation and engaging activity with staff to encourage energy and water conservation in the kitchens.  This opened the door for an expanded partnership with Dining and we are now invited to join the monthly tours of campus dining halls to recommend outreach and educational opportunities.
•	Climate Reality Project: In August Susan Beckett (Energy Program Manager) was trained by Al Gore and the Climate Reality Project to do presentation on climate change.  Thus far she has conducted five presentations to various sectors of campus, including RAs, Green Office participants, and students.  We also hosted 24 Hours of Reality in which we broadcast 
* Transportation
•	Late Night Transit maintained services levels in FY2013. No change is anticipated in FY2014. Due to the nature of boardings and since the contract pays Via Mobility Services and CU Buff Bus per hour and not per rider it is difficult to track actual ridership. 
•	The Ski Bus is presently selling at a 100% sold-out service between November and January, along with additional day-of standby sales. With below average snowfall affecting last season, we failed to sale out the last two trips. 
•	The bicycle station, jointly managed with Parking & Transportation Services, reported beyond maximum capacity for customer throughput during the fall. We expanded to two employees at a time we often had 3 employees working. Bike station #2 was opened in a temporary landscaping trailer located between Cockerell Hall and the Engineering Center as part of the Cockerell Drive Transportation Improvement Program grant from CDOT. The station opened later than anticipated, but was welcomed by all users. The permanent structure has recently been installed and final touches will take place in February for a March grand opening. Bike station #3 is in the preliminary phases of discussion and is aiming to be located in an existing structure at Williams Village. In the meantime a self service Dero FixIt rack will be placed in the vicinity of the future station. 
•	Pilot impound bicycle refurbishment, also jointly managed with Parking & Transportation Services, sold all 160 of its bicycles within 2 hours of opening the 2012 fall sale.
•	Semester Rentals, funded by a Sustainable CU grant, has continued to grow at an unanticipated but welcoming fast rate. Without additional advertising we rented all of our available bikes in 4 days. The waiting list grew to 89 soon afterwards. The program diligently purchased high quality rental bikes to prepare for the upcoming Spring rush. Currently the program has exceed the grant funded number of 150 bikes and we now have 175 bikes.  
•	www.cucommute.com, in collaboration with Denver Regional Council of Government (DRCOG) we switched from zimride to a site operated as iCarpool. It is a contracted carpool matching service funded jointly with Parking & Transportation Services. The purpose of the switch is cost savings and to have a much larger network of potential carpool matches. iCarpool will match carpoolers with anyone who registers in the Denver Metro region while zimride only matched with students, faculty, and staff of CU, Boulder County and City employees, and employees of NOAA. Zimride continues to do ticketing for the the CU Ski Bus. The goal is that we will get more users registered on the site and we will then see a higher rate of carpooling in return. 
•	The advertising program, jointly managed and funded with Parking & Transportation Services, continues to build on its success with streamlined project management and skilled student staffing. 
•	The development area of the sustainable transportation program includes projects such as pedestrian safety by enhancing bike routes and stripping and/or lane painting, increasing ridership of public transit, collaborate with other Universities to persuade RTD to retrofit RFID readers that would allow us to have a unified Buff OneCard/bus pass, working with DRCOG to increase carpooling along the Highway 36 corridor, adding a Dero FixIt rack to Will Vill and family house, eventually replace the self repair rack at Will Vill with a year round staffed bike station, adding covered and secured bike parking, and others. 


",True,"CU has several committees that satisfy the criteria for this credit; the Chancellor's Committee on Energy, Environment and Sustainability (CCEES); the Carbon Neutrality Working Group (CNWG, also charged with broad tasks such as promoting sustainability in curriculum), and the Sustainability Executive Council, an informal advisory body comprised of students, faculty and staff that work with the VCA and Provost's office to coordinate myriad sustainability functions across campus.

However, for the purposes of this credit, full information is submitted in support of the broadest group, the CCEES.

In the Chancellor’s speech on February 21, 2007, he established the Chancellor's Committee on Energy, Environment and Sustainability (CCEES) led by the VCA for the purpose of “setting sustainability goals and advising the university on all environmental matters.” He tasked the CCEES with executing the “climate neutrality” commitments he made under the Presidents Climate Commitment (PCC). Likewise, the PCC also addresses increased sustainability research, and integration of sustainability into curriculum and student life. 

Structure
As directed by the Chancellor, the VCA chairs. The CCEES may create sub-committee of related department leaders to which plan development and execution would be delegated (e.g. CNWG).

Tasking
Tasking is vertical from the CCEES’ members to their subordinate organizational units. For instance, the Provost may task appropriate Deans, Directors, and/or faculty to develop options for the integration of sustainability into curriculum.  Likewise, the VCA and FM coordinate plans to enhance conservation and efficiency programs.  Similarly, the VCSA and Environmental Center develop student life and conservation outreach programs, and so forth. All the organizational units use internal expertise, existing partnerships and related standing committees to analyze and develop plans, as appropriate.
","Based on the Chancellor’s instructions and mindful of the specific deliverables enumerated in the PCC , eleven personnel characterized as “Campus Leaders and Community Partners” were tapped to serve.  These are:

-Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs	
-UCSU (Tri-Executive)	
-Environmental Center Director	
-Vice Chancellor for Administration (Chair)
-Resource Conservation Officer
-Vice Chancellor for Research
-CU Energy Initiative Director

Most recently the members of EPAC involved with academics or with facilities and operations on campus discussed progress in sustainability, brainstormed ways in which our University was lacking as far as sustainability initiatives were concerned, and considered how to address these issues.   The Climate Action Plan (CAP) Committee was established from EPAC members in 2009 to help draft the CAP and the Climate Change Adaptation Task Force was created by the EPAC members in 2012 in order to add the Adaptation section to the CAP.  The members of EPAC continue to ensure that the objectives set forth in the Climate Action Plan are being carried out as planned.

The staff at the Office of Environmental Policy (OEP) also aided in the drafting of the CAP and continues to aid in the enforcement of the Climate Action Plan.  The OEP is also in charge of improving and maintaining environmental awareness on campus through outreach activities that address everything from recycling to water resources and sustainable food to energy usage.  For three consecutive years OEP hosted a Climate Impact Mitigation and Adaptation event to raise awareness about climate change, how it is already impacting our society, possible long-term solutions to climate change, and ways in which we must adapt in order to deal with the inevitable effects of climate change.  Since 2007 the OEP has also organized the annual EcoMadness competition between dorms to see which dorm areas can reduce their water and energy consumption the most in a month and to raise awareness about energy savings and water shortage issues.  The OEP also recruits a number of volunteers to promote and teach fans about proper recycling methods at several sporting events throughout the year.  In addition to campus outreach the OEP also promotes sustainability in academics and in facilities and operations.  A new Bachelors of Science program in Environmental Studies has been instituted in recent years through the efforts of the OEP as an objective listed in the CAP.  Among other initiatives across campus, the OEP has also helped in the re-lamping and retro-commissioning projects around campus as a way of reducing energy demand via high efficiency fixtures and energy-reducing retro-commissioning strategies.

Rich Miller, the director of the OEP and the primary sustainability officer on campus, is in charge of both environmental compliance and sustainability initiatives on campus.  Some of the many areas Rich is involved with include the campus ecological footprint, the use of natural resources, recycling initiatives, and the inclusion of sustainability in academics.  Over the past three years Rich has taken a trip to Freiburg, Germany in order to learn about sustainable initiatives abroad, improved upon the E-waste recycling programs on campus, and saw to the opening of a water reclamation facility aimed at recycling wastewater.

Since 2006, Western has made the Environmental Protection Agency’s “Top 30 College and University” green power purchasers list, ranking 20th in 2015 nationally. Western annually offsets 100% of its electrical consumption from renewable energy sources via purchases of renewable energy credits. 
•	Western recognized by Puget Sound Energy for Conservation Programs – April 2015
	Western Washington University was recognized by PSE for energy savings projects and behavior change campaigns which have resulted in significant energy savings and rebates. Since July 2013, Western has partnered with PSE on 21 projects, resulting in over 5.2 million kWh saved and $750,000 in incentive funding. These projects included lighting upgrades, HVAC control system upgrades, HVAC retrofits, and the ongoing implementation of a Resource Conservation Management program. The total electric savings is enough to power over 400 homes per year and has led to substantial savings to the university’s power bill. University behavior change campaigns, which include Sweater Days, Power Down, and Go for the Green also contributed to the final goal.
•	Carbon Emissions Continue Downward Trend – Throughout 2015
Data for FY 2015 shows an overall downward trend since 2009 and Western’s lowest carbon emissions since 2007. In order to meet state emissions requirements in 2020, 2035, and 2050, the pace of emissions reduction will need to be increased. Electricity use and natural gas combustion are the largest single contributors to Western’s emissions.
•	New Offices Receive Sustainable Office Certification - February 2015 
	Eight new offices at Western Washington University have achieved sustainable office certification from the Office of Sustainability, bringing the total to 25 offices out of 137 university-wide, or 18 percent of all campus administrative, clerical, services and operations offices. Departments recognized included Public Safety, Map Collection, Tutoring Center, Environmental Sciences, WWU Everett University Center, Biology Stockroom, Human Resources, Huxley College Office of the Dean and Woodring College Office of the Dean. The program supports actions and provides a simple way of measuring efforts that happen at the office level. Participating Offices are recognized for their level of achievement, as a way of showing recognition and appreciation for measurement of work well done. 
Go for the Green Event Celebrates Campus Residents' Sustainability – April 2015
The Residents' Resource Awareness Program held the seventh annual Go For the Green Celebration to recognize the work of Western's on-campus residents' efforts to foster more sustainable practices during winter quarter's competition highlighting waste, water, natural gas and electricity consumption. Residents, resident advisors, resident directors and University Residences administrators were in attendance to recognize student work and converse about the future of sustainability at Western through on-campus living
•	Earth Week – April 2015

•	The Fair – October 2015
The Fair, a significant part of Vikings for Change Month at Western Washington University, attracted roughly 500 people who played games, shared ideas and networked with local sustainable groups. The event, which was free and open to the public, featured free local food samples, over 20 carnival games, a model residence for low-impact living, booths from local sustainable groups, and a scavenger hunt with $900 in prizes.
•	Graduation Sustainability Pledge – June 2015
Nearly 400 Western seniors chose to be part of Western’s third Sustainability Graduation Pledge. The pledge was available to any spring 2015 graduate. Students pledged to actively work toward social and environmental responsibility beyond college and received a pledge card for their wallet, a green ribbon to wear on their cap or gown, and optional recognition on the Office of Sustainability website.
•	Move-Out Madness Event Reduced Furniture Abandoned in Neighborhoods – June 2015
Western Washington University and the City of Bellingham once again partnered to assist students in proper sorting and disposal of unwanted materials generated during annual spring move-out. Bins for reusable household items, clothing, non-perishable food, recyclable materials, and landfill waste were available at three staffed sorting stations in neighborhoods near the university. Previous years' events have reduced the number of abandoned items left in neighborhoods and diverted many pounds of recyclable and reusable items from the landfill. Over 60 yards of landfill material was collected that may have otherwise ended up on the street. Two moving trucks of reusable items were donated to local non-profit organizations. 
•	Sustainable Action Fund Grant Program – Throughout 2015
During 2015, the Sustainable Action Fund Grant Program allocated fund to on-campus sustainability projects which increase student involvement and education, reduce Western’s environmental impact, and create an aware and engaged campus community.

Approved January 9, 2014
ARTICLE I – MISSION
Section 1: Mission
The mission of the University Sustainability Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee) is to promote sustainability throughout the University – in planning, development, and operation of the campus environment and facilities, as well as in curriculum innovation, faculty, staff, and student research, and outreach to the greater community. Through these efforts, Western endeavors to become a national leader in sustainability.
ARTICLE II – GOALS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Advisory Committee is charged by the President to develop, recommend and oversee a Western Sustainability Plan containing goals, objectives, metrics and resource needs that identifies the steps necessary to meet Western’s strategic goals. The role of the University is to be a place for education and debate. In this sense, the Advisory Committee’s responsibility is to encourage passionate but balanced discussion about sustainability. The Advisory Committee does not take or express positions on behalf of the University on matters of public policy.
The Plan will enable Western to become a sustainable campus through three primary activities:
1. Build awareness, understanding, and a culture of sustainability on campus;
2. Promote and coordinate the integration of sustainability between campus operations and academic programs, including teaching, research, and service; and,
3. Report annually to the President and the President’s Cabinet on the ongoing measurement of progress toward the long-term goal of sustainability. The report should also contain recommendations for course corrections and Plan adjustments.
In order to align with budget planning timelines, the Plan should be delivered by the end of November 2014. The Advisory Committee will circulate and publish proposed recommendations in order to provide the campus community opportunities to comment and to offer feedback. It is expected that the Advisory Committee will provide updates in the interim.
ARTICLE III – GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The Advisory Committee will promote integration of sustainability across campus by seeking to incorporate sustainability into the areas of academics and operations.
Among other items, the Plan should seek to address the following:
Operations
• Integration of sustainability into campus operations and long-range planning;
• Reduce resource use, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation, seeking cost-savings wherever possible;
• The use of state-of-the-art planning tools and indicators of sustainability that enable assessment of performance; and,
• The development of an action plan for reducing Western’s carbon footprint as required by State law and as per our Climate Action Plan.
Academics
• Infuse sustainability into curricula throughout the University to prepare our students to engage global challenges and opportunities;
• Promote the application of the University’s expertise to solve complex sustainability challenges;
• Assist and support departments, programs and colleges in the creation and development of courses, curriculum, and interdisciplinary majors and minors related to sustainability;
• Advance and publicize sustainability-related research within and between disciplines;
• Help connect students with faculty, research projects, local organizations, and other resources related to sustainability;
• Encourage innovative organizational structures that facilitate education for sustainability; and,
• Use the campus as a learning laboratory to teach sustainable practices to the campus community.
Collaboration
• Encourage faculty/students to include sustainability efforts in their service learning program;
• Foster collaborations among departments, colleges, and among academic, planning, and operational functions of the University;
• Increase awareness of sustainability principles throughout the campus and the broader community;
• Promote a climate of innovation related to sustainability;
• Recognize, support, and reward initiatives that promote sustainability; and,
• Work with the Northwest Higher Education Coalition to share information on sustainability efforts.
