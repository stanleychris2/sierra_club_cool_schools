The Council recommends actions and resources in formulating programs, concepts and strategies as they are sought by the Vice President for Finance and Administration, and assists in leveraging internal and external funding for projects and initiatives. A core goal of the council is to implement sustainability elements from the Strategic Plan and help inform the next round of strategic planning. 
 
The council provides the Vice President of Finance and Administration updates on progress every year on key initiatives via an annual report that details progress using existing indicators.

The Council serves as advisory to the Office of the Vice President for Finance and Administration and to the Sustainability Office. As needed, the Council will establish Coordination Teams to address priority issues. Teams will be led by a member of the Council and may add members from the university community as needed. Team members will be appointed by the Council. Teams will focus on advancing initiatives that address Sustainability Council objectives. Coordination Teams report to the Council on a regular basis.
