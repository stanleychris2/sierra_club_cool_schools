",101378.0,,--,,--,"DESCRIPTION OF THE CO-GENERATION FACILITY 

The CI Power PlantFacility is a combined cycle co-generation plant. The Facility consists of an aircraft derivative gas turbine generator (the General Electric LM-2500), an unfired heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), an extraction/condensing steam turbine generator, and auxiliary equipment.
The LM-2500 gas turbine is equipped with an evaporative cooler to reduce inlet air temperature and increase plant electrical output. It normally operates at maximum continuous rated power, burning 215.2 to 223.8 million Btu per hour (lower heating value (LHV)) of natural gas to drive a generator which produces 21,489 to 22,381 KW of electric power during the six Time Of Use periods established by the Southern California Edison Co. (SCE). Water injection is used to reduce NOx emissions to 42 parts per million dry volume-referenced at 15% 02 (ppmdv).
The gas turbine exhaust is directed to the HRSG to produce intermediate and high pressure steam. NOx emissions will be further reduced to 9 ppmdv through the use of a selective catalytic reduction, SCR, unit located in the HRSG. The high pressure steam (890 psig, 830°F) along with the intermediate pressure steam (250 psig, saturated) will be directed through the extraction steam turbine to generate additional electricity (approx. 6,500 to 7,000 KWe). As required, 150 psig saturated steam will be extracted from the steam turbine to supply 125 psig steam to the University Campus and 10-12 psig steam will be extracted to run the cogeneration facility's deaerator. The remainder of the steam will be routed completely through the steam turbine, exiting at sub-atmospheric conditions. This exhaust steam will be condensed using an air cooled condenser and routed to the deaerator along with makeup water and Campus condensate return to complete the steam cycle. 
Based on the anticipated steam flow rates supplied to the CSH, the Facility will generate 27,162 to 27,921 KW net electric capacity. The system is expected to operate for 6,875 hours per year based on 129 hours of scheduled outages, 258 hours of unscheduled outages (system availability of 95%), and 1,498 hours of scheduled full curtailment due to SCE operations dispatching.","California State University Channel Islands (CI) controls its use of energy and greenhouse gases by the use of a web-based building management system.  It is comprised of a network of communication devices and building controllers located throughout each building and mechanical space. The function of these controls is to schedule the occupied times, operational set points, and temperatures for the lighting /ventilation systems. The campus is able to co-ordinate the time of use (schedule) of the buildings with our customers for the general class times and periods of use. This way the lights and HVAC systems will be off when nobody is home!
This system uses some of the latest technology using a centralized web-based server. This server is the central access to all of the buildings from anywhere there is internet access. This allows adjustment to the system from home without relying on someone driving out to the campus.  This creates better customer support and uses no fuel. This system automatically collects data in the form of trend logs for system diagnostics and analysis of energy usage.
This system also has built in programmable logic that responds to the ambient outside air condition to allow the use of “free cooling” when possible. This creates opportunities for the larger cooling/heating equipment to remain idle when certain conditions are met. We have currently been able to quantify electrical savings created by the energy management system by comparing one year to the next, using the data from the trend logs.
CI is currently installing energy usage metering at each building to be able to see how much energy each building is using independently. This method will keep each building running at its optimum ability to conserve energy.
 Our system has been so successful on many fronts that new BMS systems are installed as the buildings come on line.

",,,3.14,1.0,"Central Plant Water Conservation and Heat Recovery
The central plant water conservations & heat recovery project will work to optimize water use and heat recovery at the central plant. Currently we utilize domestic water to cool the bearings on our central high temperature hot water pumps. This project would automate the flow of water to these pumps and look at recovering heat from this water. The recovered heat could be sent to either the low temperature heating loop or the chilled water loop during the heating season. The project will also look at recovering heat from the ice rink cooling tower.

Baca PV Solar Array
 This project will provide more power than is consumed at the Baca Campus. The project is a hands on opportunity for students to learn about renewable energy. 

Campus Controls Upgrade Phase 2
This project is phase 2 of a 3 phase project to replace obsolete controls on campus with the latest platform of AX direct digital controls. The updated controls allow the College to apply more sophisticated logic and manage energy consumption more closely. In addition to updating controls, the project allows more space for archiving data and alarms. This data is essential for benchmarking continuous operational improvements.

Campus LED Lighting Upgrades
The campus LED lighting upgrade project is an ongoing project to replace lighting on campus with more efficient LED lighting. This project assists leverages utility rebates to assist with the restoration and replacement of campus lighting.

Honnen Ice Arena Firm Natural Gas Transportation
he Honnen firm natural gas transportation project is a change in the way we buy natural gas at our Honnen Ice Arena. Currently we are on an interruptible rate meaning Colorado Springs Utilities can stop natural gas delivery to us at any time. When this happens, Honnen Ice Arena is without heat. This project moves us from interruptible service to firm service meaning our service cannot be interrupted. For this project the College will utilize its existing contract to purchase natural gas from ontinuum Energy.

El Pomar Electrical Services Upgrade
The El Pomar electrical service upgrades project will either split the buildings electrical service or combine it with the central plant to reduce cost. Due to demand at El Pomar the building experiences rates as high as $018/kWh which is more than double the campus average of $0.085/kWh. The buildings use profile is unique because its peak demand occurs between 4 pm and 10 pm during the winter which is an on‐ peak period. During this time student are utilizing the fitness center and the field lights at on. During this same period, the central chiller plant is idle and could supply the additional capacity required. Another technique would be to add meters and move the facility from the ETL rate to the E2C rate which does not charge for demand. Either method would yield approximately a 3 to 5 year payback.

Central Plant Controls Upgrade Phase 2
The central plant controls upgrade phase 2 project will improve the automation of the central plant heating operation. The controls work includes adding controls and system logic to enable remote starting and automate temperature modulation of the high temperature hot water generators and distribution system pumps. These controls optimize central heating plant reliability and efficiency. The project will expand alarms for safety allowing the plant to be controlled remotely and left unmanned for extended periods beyond just the summer. The extended periods of time will allow central plant operators time to perform maintenance activities on the distribution system and respond to after‐hours emergencies on campus.

Barnes Repair 1st and 3rd Floor Heating Piping
Barnes repair 1st & 3rd floor piping is the third phase of piping repairs in Barnes Science Center. The project includes work to weld leaky Victaulic fittings and replace pneumatic controls on the 1st & 3rd floor. The project saves energy because the old piping must be maintained at higher operating temperatures through the summer to prevent leaking. Welding the piping will allow heating system temperatures to be setback in the summer.

Cutler HVAC System Replacement
This project will replace the existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems at Cutler Hall. Currently Cutler utilizes steam for heating provided from Bemis Hall. The systems do not have good zone control, so as a result occupants are often too hot or too cold. The new system will utilize a new variable refrigerant flow heat pump system to maximize occupant comfort and efficiency while maintaining the historic characteristics of the building. The system will also help support renovation to repurpose the second floor of the facility.

Cornerstone Retro Commissioning
The Cornerstone retro‐commissioning project will reduce the overall energy intensity at Cornerstone Arts Center. The project is to evaluate the operation of building systems and return them to the intended design parameters. From there additional savings opportunities will be identified and pursued to maximize the buildings energy performance. Currently the building utilizes large quantities of outside air. As part of this project we will attempt to minimize the amount of conditioned air that leaves the building when indoor air quality is at acceptable levels. In many cases commissioning work also improves occupant comfort.

Technology and service is provided by Tri-Star and have resulted in savings of 20-25% on consumption. 

LEED Gold-Certified Faculty House contains an HVAC system that is highly energy efficient. The air conditioning is partly an outdoor air cooling system. On warm days, it uses chilled water provided by the main campus system – which also provides steam heat during winter. When the outdoor air is dry, and temperatures range from around 55 to 65 degrees, automatic controls shut off the chilled water flow and louvers open to bring in outside air. Additional sensors count occupancy and adjust the necessary amount of air flow accordingly. 

The Gary C. Comer Geochemistry Building on the LDEO campus also has occupancy sensors for both heating and lighting.

The Allan Rosenfield Building has HVAC mechanical timers installed on each of its air handling units that serve non-critical spaces.  The timers shut down the fan at 10 pm and turn it back on at 5 am.  Building management systems are used in the Audubon (Russ Berrie, Irving, Lasker) buildings to set back temperature a few degrees at night to reduce mechanical load in non-critical areas and/or raise the chilled water temperature.

As renovations continue preference is given to install LED lighting especially in large public open spaces.","Most academic spaces on the Morningside campus have lighting controls with timers, a combination of motion and infrared sensors as appropriate to the lighting application. The university is transitioning to newer, more reliable technology for all future construction projects. These new controls will be able to determine whether a space is truly vacant and switch off lights accordingly, as well as adjusting to natural light levels. The Alumni Center has the new device installed already. Spaces under renovation are also retrofitted with occupancy sensors whenever appropriate to the lighting application. There are photocell and infrared timers. New LED lighting has been installed with sensors that have a set back feature that will reduce the lighting down to 50% but when walk through the motion sensor return to preset lighting percentage.  Additionally, all the light poles on campus are on timers. Wall Switch occupancy sensors are installed in dorm rooms and dorm bathrooms as an energy conservation measure. When the lights are manually turned off, they will not be controlled by motion in the room until they are manually turned back on.  Where the motion sensor location does not have a clear view of the students in the space, a digital timer sensor is installed instead, as an energy conservation measure. Timer switches are manually turned on and will save energy by automatically turning the lights off after a preset time.

Five standing-column wells have been installed in Radcliffe Yard to provide heating and cooling for the renovated classroom building, Byerly Hall. In 2012, the system was connected to a second building:

The pumps draw well water from a depth of 1500 feet and run it through pipes that lead to fan coil units in each space. As a cost-effective and more efficient measure, Fay House was connected to the five standing column wells already in place for Byerly Hall. Heat exchangers and four additional heat pumps were also installed. The new system separates the water circulating in the ground from that in the buildings, thus ensuring a balanced load between the wells and preventing contaminants like iron particles from clogging the mechanical equipment. 

Harvard engineering students conducted a study to determine if the expansion was feasible:

Five smaller cogeneration units (~75 kW each) are located across campus, two of which are in athletics facilities to heat swimming pools.
","As part of Harvard's climate strategy. Many Schools and departments are undergoing multi-year commissioning and recommissioning. Here are two examples:

At the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering (LISE) building an ongoing retro-commissioning project has resulted in over $3.15 million in cumulative savings since 2009. The facilities team monitors over 3,400 data points from equipment such as air handling units, and chilled and hot water pumps. Reductions in airflow have had greatest impact, while additional actions like identifying leaks that are wasting energy have also contributed.

At Harvard Business School, an ongoing commissioning project, underway since 2008, has covered 14 buildings, yielding more than $320,000 in savings that have contributed to a 3.6 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The simple payback (when the costs are made up for by the savings) for the projects they have implemented is well under two years (1.51 years). 

At the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums a post-completion commissioning project will continually evaluate and verify the performance of the building’s mechanical systems, while also identifying new opportunities for operational efficiency.

Additionally, the Green Building Standards have the following policy and requirements regarding post-construction Optimization: 

""Project Closeout"" marks the formal transition between the construction and operation phases in the building lifecycle.  To ensure a smooth transition it's essential that Building Managers, Operators, and Stewards are equipped with the information they will need to optimally care for and maintain the building.

To capture critical project data and prepare projects for optimal operational excellence, Harvard has identified various levels of Closeout Documentation / Operations and Maintenance Readiness for projects depending on their scope of work.  The requirements are captured Harvard's Green Building Standards.

Project teams and Project Managers should submit all closeout documentation in accordance with the appropriate Asset Management Program.  Example documentation turnover may consist of:

To identify and address energy use in buildings, the Colleges have worked closely with leading engineering and energy firms to identify and prioritize energy-related projects. The positive impact of these projects, such as energy conservation, water conservation, and waste reduction are tracked. Examples of projects include updated lighting across HWS and campus-wide revamps to central heating and cooling systems.

Installing occupancy sensors: Occupancy sensors significantly reduce electrical usage by automatically turning off lights when campus spaces are not occupied. They have been installed in a number of campus offices, conference rooms, classrooms and restrooms.

De-lamping and lighting modifications: Site surveys identified that many spaces at the Colleges had either too many lighting fixtures or inefficient lighting. Since approximately one-third of annual electrical usage can be attributed to lighting, outdated and inefficient lighting across campus has been replaced with new technologies that offer improved light output at reduced energy consumption.

Updating HVAC systems: The Colleges are working to revamp old and outdated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for maximum efficiency without sacrificing the comfort of building occupants. Modifications are being made to better control the ventilation of unoccupied building spaces, and upgrading current steam and chilled water generation and distribution systems to operate in accordance with industry best practices.

Controlling temperature: The Colleges’ energy management system will set indoor temperature at 68°F during the heating season and at 76°F during the cooling season. Occupants who control the temperatures in their spaces are expected to follow this policy by using these ranges. During off-hours and on weekends and holidays, the temperature in most non-residential spaces in both heating and cooling mode will be reset.

Purchasing energy-efficient equipment: All of the Colleges’ equipment purchases must be Energy Star rated for superior energy efficiency.

Energy Savings Program (ESP)- Penn State has implemented a program following the guidelines of the PA Guaranteed Energy Savings Program. Using an Energy Service Company (ESCO), Penn State awards performance contracts where the entire cost of the project can be recovered through energy savings. ESP projects are large in nature and may combine multiple energy savings efforts into one project. The maximum payback for these projects is 10 years including financing costs. Some projects are performed by internal technical staff. These projects are Capital funded. Multiple ESP projects have been completed at University Park as well projects at multiple commonwealth campuses. 

Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) - These projects are smaller in scope and are completed in E&G buildings. The average simple payback is less than 5 years. Solutions in the past have included:
•Improving Steam Traps
•Installing Low-flow water fixtures
•Upgrading Chiller/Chilled Water
•Programming Thermostats
•Reprogramming/ upgrading control systems
•Tuning up systems and equipment
•Switching fuel selection
•Cleaning and flushing HVAC (heating, venting and air conditioning) piping
•Installing room occupancy sensors
•Winter Break shutdown

As opportunities arise, miscellaneous projects are initiated to reduce energy consumption. As buildings are connected to University Park's central chilled water system and standalone systems are removed, a significant energy savings is expected. Power management software has been rolled out to campus computers for energy conservation. A rapid commissioning initiative was implemented to quickly look at HVAC systems in buildings to find low and no-cost energy conservation solutions.

HMC 2 employs active chill beams to ventilate rooms. The air handling units pump air in to ducts that are fitted with heating coils. As cold air is pushed across the periphery of the ducts and into the rooms, the negative pressure gradient formed at the mouth of the duct sucks in stale air from the room.

The same LED task lights were also installed in Sweet Hall during a recent major renovation.","Occupancy sensors for lighting have been installed as retrofit projects in most classroom buildings as well as the public spaces and bathrooms of most student housing on campus.  Occupancy sensors and timers for lighting have been installed in buildings across campus as part of the Cardinal Green Office Program (http://sem.stanford.edu/buildings_initiatives). Stanford's Guidelines for Sustainable Buildings also makes explicit mention of occupancy sensors as a preferred design strategy to increase efficiency (http://sem.stanford.edu/sites/sem.stanford.edu/files/documents/Stanford_sustainable_guidelines.pdf), and thus these sensors are now standard practice for new construction projects. 

An excellent example of sensors can be found in the Y2E2 building, which includes both sensors for occupancy and photocell technology for daylight control.

",1800941.0,n/a,--,n/a,101716.0,"Between 1987 and 2015, Stanford obtained the vast majority of its electricity from an onsite cogeneration facility that used natural gas as its fuel source. However, cogeneration requires a reliance on fossil fuels that comprised a significant majority of Stanford’s greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, Stanford launched a new energy system that came online in 2015 called Stanford Energy System Innovations (SESI). Through SESI, the vast majority of campus building heating needs are now met by hot water generated at the CEF, which uses heat recovery chillers to recover the waste heat from the chilled water that Stanford uses to cool its buildings to create 93% of the hot water need for building heating. Due to the significant heat recovery and lower line losses of hot water compared to steam, the new energy system is approximately 70% more efficient than the previous combined heat and power process provided by cogeneration. By the end of 2016, 65% of Stanford's electricity supply will be from renewable sources, allowing Stanford's total emissions to drop by 68%. For more information, please visit http://sustainable.stanford.edu/sesi. 
","Stanford is systematically reviewing the HVAC systems of 90 of its largest buildings, then adjusting or repairing the systems to ensure they work as designed. Technicians who conduct the reviews also recommend ways to further improve energy performance through ERP projects. The recommissioning of all 90 buildings was completed by the end of 2010 and all buildings are on a three-year renewal cycle.

Please see subsequent sections for details on major and minor retrofit programs.","Since the 1980s, Stanford has employed energy metering on all of its facilities to understand how and where energy is being used. In 2012, Stanford launched a project called Utilities, Metering, Billing, Reporting, and Sustainability (UMBRS), which is an initiative to bring the data from all of Stanford's energy and water meters into a central database to be used in applications such as department billing, energy use monitoring, and sustainability reporting, among others. For instance, the UMBRS project allowed the Office of Sustainability to launch energy and water dashboards in 2014 that are publicy available through the Sustainable Stanford website at http://sustainable.stanford.edu/buildings. In 2015, maintenance of the database was adopted by Stanford's Office of Sustainability via a Business Systems unit with 2 FTEs, which supports the system to ensure that it meets the needs of personnel throughout the Department of Sustainability & Energy Management. 

Additionally, Stanford’s Energy Management & Control System is a computer-based centralized system for scheduling and providing HVAC control for many campus buildings.  Stanford utilizes a SCADA (Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition) system that provides real-time information and diagnostics of the campus power network (http://scadaweb/hv/).

Finally, the new Central Energy Facility that came online in April 2015 utilizes a software developed at Stanford called the Energy Optimization Solution (EOS). EOS monitors over 1,220 factors including temperature, electricity cost, time of day, building occupancy, etc. to make sure the heat recovery chillers, which are the crux of the new energy system, are running at optimal times. EOS also monitors when the backup boilers and chillers need to be activated to meet campus demand. Finally, EOS sets predictions for two weeks into the future and adjusts those predictions every 15 minutes as new data comes in. EOS essentially allows Stanford to run its Central Energy Facility on ""autopilot"" since it takes so many factors into account that humans would not be able to, but the university does still have two plant operators working in the plant controls room 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.",2342.0,774.0,"Plug Load Reduction Programs
In summer 2014, Stanford conducted a Plug Load Equipment Inventory to collect data on 55 types of electricity-consuming equipment in 220 buildings across Stanford's campus. Stanford then expanded the inventory in summer 2015 to include various types of student residences, additional lab buildings, and off-campus leased spaces. The inventory resulted in a database of 110,000 pieces of electronic equipment, including relevant attributes of each type of equipment that influence its energy consumption (such as an Energy Star rating). Stanford analyzed this data and ultimately generated 33 potential plug load reduction program options that fall into 5 categories: energy efficiency measures for existing equipment (either efficiency upgrades or installation of efficiency devices such as appliance timers or smart strips), space heating, sustainability in information technology, green labs, and procurement policies. Stanford has launched initiatives in each of these program categories to effectively address plug loads in the coming years. If all 33 viable program options are implemented, Stanford could save a total of $2.3 million annually. See http://sustainable.stanford.edu/plug-load-inventory

ERP Express—Laboratory Equipment

Stanford’s Cardinal Green Labs program offers rebates to labs for upgrading laboratory equipment to energy efficient models. The program offers “express” rebates for ultra-low temperature freezers and custom rebates for other equipment. Rebate amounts are based on the energy cost savings accrued over a five year period. The program also offers free room-temperature storage starter kits as an alternative to cold storage. Finally, the program also provides free timers for select lab equipment that will automatically shut equipment off at night. More information on is available here: https://sustainable.stanford.edu/cardinal-green/cardinal-green-labs/energy-programs.

ERP Express—Office Equipment

As a result of the plug load equipment inventory in summer 2014, Stanford launched the Timer Direct Install program in fall 2015. Pilots conducted throughout 2015 showed that installing timers on large coffee makers, water coolers, hot water dispensers, and cable boxes would pay back in under one year. Through the ERP Express rebate program, Stanford was able to fund the purchase of programmable timers up front and utilize intern support to install them on the selected equipment campus-wide.Ultimately, we anticipate that over 500 timers will be installed as a result of this program.

Reduced electrical consumption within individual workstations and shared office areas is also a major goal of the Cardinal Green Office Program. To support facility managers and building-level ""green champions"" seeking an extra incentive to make strategic purchases and operational decisions, ERP Express for Office Equipment offers small rebates for the purchase and installation of Smart Strips and appliance timers for any equipment besides the four included in the Timer Direct Install program. Eligibility requirements, terms and conditions, as well as other important information about the rebate program can be found online.

Space Heater Swap: 
In Winter 2015, Stanford launched its first space heater swap initiative in conjunction with the Cardinal Green Buildings campaign. When individuals went online to pledge to ""turn off for break,"" they were also given the opportunity to volunteer to turn in their space heater for a Sustainable Stanford branded fleece. Of the over 1,300 pledges collected, 50 individuals volunteered to turn in their space heaters, which were collected in January 2016.
","Trees are consciously placed to provide shading and cooling for buildings and pavement with an emphasis on deciduous trees along the southern and western building exposures.

http://sustainable.stanford.edu/landscape_and_grounds","Stanford has utilized vending machine sensors for a number of years as a result of a student initiative. As an example, all vending machines within the Mitchell Building, home to the School of Earth Sciences, are equipped with motion sensors. 

The Plug Load Equipment Inventory in summer 2014 cataloged all the vending machines without sensors on campus. With this data in hand, Stanford will make a comprehensive effort to install vending misers on those machines that don't currently have them, activate onboard controls, and/or delamp machines across campus.",3.14,1.2,"WHOLE BUILDING RETROFITS PROGRAM

The Whole Building Energy Retrofit Program (WBERP) seeks to reduce energy consumption in Stanford’s most energy-intensive buildings. This $30 million capital program began in 2004 to address the 12 campus buildings consuming the most energy and now includes the top 27, which represent 60% of total campus energy use. Retrofits have been completed in 15 buildings thus far and have saved more than $4.5 million a year in energy costs. The program has also yielded over $2 million in financial incentives via Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) rebates. In 2014-15, construction was completed on a controls upgrade project at the Clark Center that is expected to save over $400,000 per year. Designs were completed for retrofits at the Mechanical Engineering Lab and Varian, and energy studies were completed for the Physics/Astrophysics Building and Lorry Lokey (Chem/Bio).

ENERGY RETROFIT PROGRAM (ERP)

Since 1993, the Energy Retrofit Program (ERP) has provided rebates to Stanford Utility users who install efficiency upgrades within their facilities. ERP has invested more than $10 million over 15 years in improving energy efficiency through building-level technology upgrades, such as T8 lamps and electronic ballasts, variable-speed drives for motors, LED exit signs and spectrally selective window film. Rebates cover some or all of the upgrade costs, depending on the project payback period. Thirteen ERP projects were completed in 2014-15, for estimated savings of over $600,000 per year. These included heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) upgrades, new LED lighting, new air compressors, and server virtualization.

The new CEF is 70% more efficient than the original cogeneration plant. The data included in this credit for calendar year 2015 includes three months of cogeneration (January through March) and nine months of the new energy system (April through December). Building energy consumption and emissions numbers will continue to drop in 2016 accordingly. 

The figures used in this credit represent all the electricity purchased by Stanford in 2015, 197,377 MMBtu of which goes towards Stanford's Central Energy Facility for chilled water generation. Through the heat recovery technology employed at the plant, Stanford is able to meet 93% of its building heating needs through the creation of hot water from the waste heat from the chilled water system. The remaining 7% of building heating comes from natural gas, most of which is consumed by backup hot water generators that run when the demand for building heating is so high that the need cannot be met with the hot water produced through heat recovery. Natural gas also goes to some buildings directly on campus for building heating that do not receive energy from Stanford's Central Energy Facility. 

The figure used for district steam/hot water in this credit captures only the hot water production that is generated through the backup hot water generators and the steam produced through Stanford's cogeneration system between January and March 2015, since the majority of hot water generated using Stanford's heat recovery chillers is essentially a byproduct of chilled water production and is thus captured in the ""purchased electricity"" credit field.

The occupancy is based on the hours the particular building or space is being most utilized, such as classes or labs.  The unoccupied times are mostly after hours when a limited amount of students or faculty are in the building.  Both times have different temperature set points, (a set point is the desired numerical value you wish to achieve).  During occupied mode, the devices supplying heat to the building consume enough energy to meet the most common comfortable surrounding air temperature for human beings, between 70 to 74 degrees Fahrenheit.  However, due to energy usage stated earlier, it is not necessary to maintain those occupied temperatures when there is little or no one in the building or space.  This is when the unoccupied energy schedule kicks in.  During this time the building control, we call it the Energy Management System (EMS), will ""reset"" the set point to a lower value, such as 58 df.  The reasons are two fold:  One, we do not want to freeze the building piping, such as water lines and spinkler heads. Two, we don't want to get too low where we would consume more energy to heat the spaces back up for the occupied time comfort levels than if we just let the space stay in a constant occupied temperature set point for 24 hours.  

 A similar premise is utilized in the summer months, when excessive amounts of heat need to be removed from the space or building. During occupied times, the set point is lowered and raised during unoccupied times.  Again, moderation comes into play.  You don't want to have the temperature go so high while unoccupied, because it costs more dollars in energy to cool it back down for the next occupied cycle than it would to just keep the building at a constant occupied state.

Off the top of my head, I'd say a good 90% of the academic buildings have at least some their indoor climates controlled by the EMS.

Since the campus is served by one main feed for electricity and water, and by a central steam plant and bioenergy plant for heat, there are no revenue meters from utility providers on individual academic or administrative buildings. The digital meters described above were installed several years ago for energy management purposes. Additionally, ancillary buildings such as student housing, athletics and parkades are revenue metered for electricity, gas/steam and water by UBC Utilities.

Over 60 buildings across campus are connected to Pulse Energy's energy management software, which collects, analyzes, and communicates real-time energy intelligence to building operators and management, visible on the public dashboard (https://my.pulseenergy.com/ubc/dashboard). A Monitoring, Targeting and Reporting system is being implemented to act on the information being gathered and presented by the software.
",5093.3,95.8,"UBC has completed over half of the five-year Academic District Energy System (ADES) steam to hot water conversion project, including design of the new Campus Energy Centre, which will replace the campus’ aging steam plant. When complete, the ADES will connect 130 buildings to the more efficient hot water district energy system and will reduce emissions by 22 per cent and result in annualized cost savings and cost avoidance by FY18 of $5.5 million. The steam to hot water conversion will also enable a flexible platform for alternative energy sources and research and demonstration projects (http://energy.ubc.ca/projects/district-energy/).

Other recent equipment replacements with higher efficiency alternatives include a boiler retrofit in UBC’s Centre for Comparative Medicine, cooling equipment replacement in the Earth & Ocean Sciences Building as well as the replacement of several 20 year-old steam absorption chillers with heat recovery chillers (http://energy.ubc.ca/projects/energy-conservation/).

Student Housing and Hospitality Services (SHHS) also completed a number of water efficiency upgrades to student residences, as part of their five-year Building Retrofit and Upgrade Schedule.
","UBC’s LEED Implementation Guide includes several mandatory credits, including credit SSc7.1 – Heat Island Effect: Non-roof, which specifies that reducing the effects of heat island and increasing permeable and landscaped surfaces is a priority for UBC. http://sustain.ubc.ca/sites/sustain.ubc.ca/files/uploads/CampusSustainability/CS_PDFs/GreenBuildings/UBCLEEDImplementationGuideline_20130424.pdf

","In 2013, UBC Sustainability partnered with a Clean Energy Master student to study energy-saving optimization systems for vending machines and piloted vending misers with occupancy sensors which showed a 40% reduction in energy when compared to a conventional vending machine. Approximately 20% of UBC vending machines are Energy Star rated.",2.05,1.2,"In addition to the aforementioned district energy system upgrades and continuous optimization program, UBC has implemented several heating and cooling retrofits as well as preventative maintenance initiatives such as coil cleaning and the use of energy efficient air filters. UBC is also undergoing a campus-wide laboratory energy conservation program which includes fumehood face velocity optimization, ventilation rebalancing, and variable speed exhaust fans. Upcoming projects include a heat recovery chiller, waste heat recovery, enhanced occupancy-based HVAC and lighting control, deep retrofit building audits, and ongoing monitoring of buildings.

Energy conservation by behaviour change is championed through UBC’s signature sustainability engagement programs targeting residences, offices and labs. Key programs include the Aim to Sustain energy and water conservation competition in student residences and the Shut the Sash competition targeting energy conservation in labs. Energy conservation is also a key theme of UBC’s Sustainability Coordinator program, which targets over 80 staff sustainability coordinators across campus through training, toolkits, lunch and learns, and resources.

Total cost to implement these projects was $42.9M, of which $11.5M was offset by incentives from the UC/CSU/IOU Partnership, delivered by SDG&E.

The program includes the following, among other projects:  (1) major HVAC retrofits in all major lab buildings built prior to 1992 – seven completed and eight more underway; (2) recommissioning of 26 buildings; (3) elimination of all T12 fluorescent lighting on campus; (4) several LED and induction lighting installations, with occupancy sensor control; and more.
","UC San Diego has a Johnson Controls Metasys 5.0 building control system. The entire campus, down to the zone level, can be seen on the Metasys front end system. UC San Diego is installing the world's 1st microgrid master controller and optimizer software suite under a $2M grant that will reschedule on an hourly basis the mix of self generation, grid imports, electric and thermal storage, and demand load as a Virtual Power Plant based upon real time signals from the market, prevailing economics, known efficiencies and predicted environmental emissions, a prototype of the future Smart Grid.

UC San Diego currently has intelligent, utility-grade ION electricity meters on approximately 70% of the campus’s total electricity load, monitoring at the individual building level. These meters monitor energy and power quality, and interface with an existing PowerLogic ION Enterprise® web-enabled software system. In the next year, UC San Diego will upgrade 108 additional energy meters, and bring them into the PowerLogic ION software system.

In addition to electric meters, the campus has BTU meters on chilled water and hot water inputs on all major buildings on campus. These meters provide 15-minute interval data on temperature, flow and BTU to a central online database

","UC San Diego’s campus master plan and other approved planning document define the use of native plantings.  Excerpts: “Indigenous vegetation should be considered as a landscape fabric that has a coastal sage and chaparral integrity and heritage to it.”

“The use of turf grass as a ground cover is discouraged except in sunny locations where students, faculty…may gather on a lawn. Planting areas, to the greatest extent possible, should be covered by a variety of xeric-tolerant, indigenous, and drought adapted ornamental shrubbery and ground cover.”

The landscape management staff values the use of native plants; When reviewing plans for a new landscape, inclusion of appropriate native plantings are verified. For example recommending the use of Salvia clevelandii for a shrub in housing project instead of using Pittosporum crassifolium. UC San Diego landscape management employees are the unofficial watch dogs for the protection of existing native habitat adjacent to a new development. Plant material identification questions during employment hiring include common native plantings.

Reduce Conditioning Loads

To reduce a buildings dependence on mechanical heating and cooling, the Designer should design exterior wall assemblies to be a minimum of R-19 and roof assemblies to a minimum of R-30. All glazing should incorporate double-glazed insulated glass units with a low-E coating, argon-filled with a U-factor of ≤ 0.27. Seasonal shading (e.g., deciduous trees, porches, horizontal sun shades and roof overhangs) should be provided to south facing glazing. Thermal mass should be incorporated within a building, since high mass buildings can stabilize temperature swings by storing heat during the day and releasing it during the evening, thus reducing the building’s peak cooling loads.
",8872.9,,--,"UConn’s 25 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility is classified as a Class III Renewable Energy source by the State of Connecticut and it generates Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), based on its high efficiency factor as a microgrid source of combined heat, cooling and power for nearly 90% of the main campus. In turn, UConn uses proceeds from these REC sales to finance sustainable energy and energy efficiency projects, like retro-commissioning, re-lamping and more.

The cogen facility produces 100% of the core campus's electricity needs, while the remainder of electricity for more remote portions of the main campus (for CY 2011, 12% of the total electric demand) is purchased from ConEd with a renewables contract specifying that a minimum of 40% of the amount purchased be produced from renewable sources.

The University’s Cogeneration facility uses natural gas, with ultra-low sulfur fuel oil (ULSF) as a back-up fuel source, to fire three Solar Taurus 70 combustion turbine generators to produce electricity. Waste heat from the turbines is used to produce high pressure steam, which is then used in a steam turbine generator to produce additional electricity. The steam turbine exhaust or reduced steam is supplied to internal plant use, to provide Chilled Water via the three York absorption chillers or to the campus distribution network. The network reduces the steam to low pressure 65 psig for building heating and kitchen service.

The core university obtains 100% of its electrical needs from this facility. Buildings not in the core campus (such as the East/Agricultural Campus) are connected to the ConEd grid with a minimum of 35% of electricity purchased from renewable sources in 2013, and increased that to a minimum of 40% from renewable sources in January 2014.
The nearby Depot campus is grid connected but the UConn occupied buildings receive baseload electricity, and some of their heating and cooling, from an on-site 400 kw hydrogen fuel cell. UConn is completing a project this year that will make this fuel cell and a 6 kw solar array at the Depot, a microgrid, capable of operating in ""island"" mode, independent of the utility grid.
Working with the CT Center for Advanced Technologies (CCAT), in 2011, UConn developed a Renewable/Sustainable Energy Strategic Plan that will facilitate the installation of up to six different types of demonstration-scale (typically < 10 kw) types of renewable or clean distributed generation on our campus, including solar (PV and thermal), wind, geothermal, biomass/biofuels and fuel cell technologies.
Additionally, a 400 kW methane powered hydrogen fuel cell was installed in April, 2012 on the Depot campus. This fuel cell has supplied roughly most of the electricity and some of the thermal energy needs for our Depot Campus, the largest consumer of Storrs Campus' energy needs not covered by the cogeneration facility

Overview
Engineers undertake a thorough investigation of available building documentation, energy usage history, and similar pertinent data, while conducting meetings with building staff.
Field technicians and tradesmen gather data regarding operating conditions, sensor accuracy, equipment condition, and historic maintenance data from the field and current maintenance staff.
The composite teams discuss findings and then look to restore mechanical systems to their original design while implementing energy saving improvements.
The teams take the lead in making small changes and recommending larger capital projects, which require more funding, to Engineering or Maintenance for augmenting and sustaining the building's energy saving strategies.
Building system control experts implement modern methods of control, monitor energy usage after changes, review actual metered data, and verify the savings.","The building energy system controls are connected to Direct Digital Controls (DDC), which allows real time energy metering, controlled set-backs, and system scheduling.

All heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) were inspected to ensure they are operating correctly, and within the original design specifications. A number of the systems in the library were not operating the way they were supposed to function.  UMD hired Hallberg Engineering to take a deep look at the library’s HVAC systems to see if they could find any areas where we could improve. The recommissioning project consisted of reviewing building usage, analyzing energy consumption patterns, and then coming up with possible solutions that would work for our budget. Hallberg Engineering found twelve main Energy Conservation Opportunities, and eight of those would have a payback of ten years or less. A ‘payback’ is when the cost savings of an upgrade or fix would equal the cost of the upgrade or fix itself. By implementing these eight Energy Conservation Opportunities, UMD would save over $27,900 annually. Since the recommissioning project ended, UMD’s Maintenance & Operations Supervisor has been leading his crew to implement the various recommendations.

Major recommissioning efforts have been recently completed for the University's two main chilled water generation facilities, and a utility meter retro-commissioning project is currently underway.  ","Nearly all University facilities are submetered for electric, steam, chilled water, natural gas, and water/sewage.  Electric, steam, and chilled water meters are electronic and connected to the University's extensive Automated Logic energy management system.  It is estimated that 90% of University facilities are controlled by the Automated Logic system, which controls building temperatures, humidity, and other environmental conditions according to building schedules and demands.  An Aircuity demand controlled ventilation system has been installed in several recent projects to improve energy efficiency and air quality in research spaces by meeting space demands according to actual air quality measurements rather than a set number of air changes per hour.  A new Enterprise Energy Management system has been implemented to track energy and water use and cost for all buildings.  The system pulls live meter data for electricity, steam, and chilled water consumption from the Automated Logic system, and provides engineers and energy managers with the ability to quickly compare and trend utility consumption and costs by building and in total.

The Vanderbilt Co-generation power plant burned its last piece of coal on November 19, 2014. The plant, which produces 23 percent of Vanderbilt’s electricity, 90 percent of its heat and 40 percent of its cooling, now runs exclusively on natural gas. This cogeneration process is quite efficient: heat, which would otherwise be a wasted byproduct of electricity and steam generation, is used to produce more steam and hot water. The remaining 77% of electricity consumed at Vanderbilt is purchased directly from Nashville Electric Service from Tennessee Valley Authority. 

The decommissioning of the plant’s last coal boiler in December 2014 brings the power plant’s 126-year reliance on coal to an end. The modern structure, built in 1962, has been partially powered by natural gas since 1988, but still burned 105 million pounds of coal and produced 15 million pounds of ash waste per year.

The environmental benefits of the conversion are significant. Greenhouse gas emissions—the carbon footprint of the power plant—will go down by as much as 40 percent. The conversion will also decrease the emission of particulate matter by more than 50 percent and virtually eliminates emissions of mercury, hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide and other air pollutants.

Operationally, converting to natural gas will make the plant more efficient, require far less maintenance and be more reliable. Additionally, it will be better able to meet stricter EPA regulations.

Vanderbilt is also committed to installing more energy efficient systems and fixtures when replacement is needed for the older systems and fixtures. Buildings are also retrocommissioned periodically to reset the building systems to optimal energy efficiency standards. In 2015, Vanderbilt Plant Operations put together a Utility Conservation Task Force consisting of partners from various parts of Plant Operations who work together to plan efficiency projects that will save both natural resources and money spent on these utilities. This task force brainstorms future utility conservation projects, evaluates potential projects, and implements these projects across campus.

A program called EnergyVU, a new online energy dashboard for Vanderbilt, collects a new data point from the meters every five minutes for each building on campus. Vanderbilt Plant Operations launched this powerful tool during the summer of 2013, and it is now available to anyone on campus. Users can compare the energy use of a specific building over time or to a set of other buildings. Vanderbilt also has a dedicated Campus Energy Manager.
Additionally, each of the ten first-year residence halls have “Green Lights” screens which connect to Vanderbilt’s energy dashboard, energyvu.vanderbilt.edu, and alert the students and visitors of the energy usage of each building 24 hours a day. The “Green Lights” screens also notify students as to whether they are above or below their targeted energy usage for the day.

Vanderbilt installed a solar thermal hot water heater in 2015 funded by the Vanderbilt Green Fund proposal. The solar hot water system has a capacity of 120 gallons, and supplies hot water to the Currey Tennis Center. The tennis center includes shower facilities, so the solar hot water system supplies hot water to a direct use in the building. Since the installation of the solar hot water system, the building has used 40% less natural gas than compared to the same timeframe the previous year. 

Since 2007, these improvements have saved at least 12,513,500 kwh, 7,300 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, and $1,260,000 in electricity/steam/chilled water costs.
