The University’s organizational mission, vision, and goals are articulated in the Statement of Common Purpose and the University’s Strategic Plan, American University and the Next Decade: Leadership for a Changing World.  The Statement was developed in collaboration with faculty, students, and staff and was widely discussed on campus and endorsed by the Board of Trustees.  

As part of the University’s accreditation process, AU presented “AU Self-Study” for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in 2014.  The Statement of Common Purpose is reaffirmed during that process.     

--Strategic and long-term planning-- 
The current AU Strategic Plan, which covers a ten-year period from fiscal year 2010 – fiscal year 2020, was developed with intensive involvement from all campus constituencies, including students, supervisory and non-supervisory staff, and faculty.  All of the members of the University community were invited to a series of town hall meetings and open dialogues to provide input to the Plan.  

AU demonstrated a direct linkage between strategic/long-term goals and resource allocations since its inception of the Strategic Plan.  

In order to monitor progress towards the strategic plan goals, a number of university-wide assessments have been conducted on a regular basis.  Examples include the Customer Satisfaction Survey for students, faculty, supervisory and non-supervisory staff; and the Chronicle’s Best Place to Work survey.          

--Establishing new policies, programs, or initiatives--
 Governance structures exist where students, staff and faculty participate in decisions establishing new policies, programs and other initiatives.  These include the Faculty Senate, Staff Council, Student Government, Committees, Project Teams and Task Forces.  For example, the Faculty Senate was instrumental in revising the faculty manual, academic regulation and tenure and promotion guidelines.  Staff Council promotes understanding, facilitates communication and serves as an advocate for staff issues.  The Student Government is designed to provide students with an opportunity to be involved in the decision making process.  Students represented include undergraduate, student bar association and graduate leadership council.  Various committees, project teams and task forces are formed as needed to address university issues.  Members include a cross representation of faculty, staff and students depending on the nature of the charge.  Their recommendations are presented to management for consideration.

--Existing or prospective physical resources--
 The University’s capital budget is a multi-year financial plan to support the institution’s long-term capital development goals, which include new construction, major renovations, and facility improvement of university buildings and campus infrastructure.  Integration of the operating budget and capital budget provides a linkage between the camps master plan and academic priorities to align with the University’s Strategic Plan.  

In assessing the facility needs of academic or administrative departments, numerous focus groups are consulted, including students, faculty and staff.  One recent example is the Repurposing the Mary Graydon Center to create the Student Union initiative.      

--Budgeting, staffing and financial planning--
Appointed by the President, the University Budget Committee (UBC) is co-chaired by the Provost and the CFO/VP Treasurer, includes members of Faculty Senate, student leaders representing the Student Government, the Graduate Leadership Council, and the Student Bar Association, a member of the Staff Council representing supervisory and non-supervisory staff, and administrators.  This group played a key role in making recommendations on the budget development criteria and university funding priorities for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to the President, who ultimately presented a balanced budget to the Board of Trustees for approval.  The budget development criteria include pricing considerations, strategic plan resources, staffing, and other financial planning projections.

",--,,**,True,True,True,True,True,--,True,"Establishing Organizational mission, vision, and/or goals:

Students are generally elected to the majority of campus committees. These committees take on different aspects of the college's mission. The best example is probably CRIC which is tasked with pursuing ethical investment and can influence the mission and vision of the college. CRIC is comprised of students, a faculty adviser and the Treasurer of the College, and is the liaison body to the Board of Trustees. In addition, students who sit on College Council are actively encouraged to provide their insight on whatever the College Council is discussing at the time. Most recently, they have been involved with the Strategic Plan, the Facilities Master Plan, the Sesquicentennial celebration, and the search for the next Vice President and Dean of Students.
Strategic and long-term planning-

As mentioned above, students were engaged in the creation of the strategic plan and the Facilities Master Plan, both through committees and meetings that were open to the campus community to provide feedback.

Existing or prospective physical resources- The Facilities Master Plan which delineates future physical resource management (campus growth and renovations) was submitted to students for comment in addition to students in pertinent committees.

Budgeting, staffing and financial planning: Again, CRIC is crucial part of financial planning. In terms of staffing, students in each department are encouraged to give feedback on potential professors.

Carnegie Mellon University,2015-12-10,2015-12-10 11:04:14,bk11@andrew.cmu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Carnegie Mellon University students are able to participate in the election process for a variety of governing bodies, such as Student Government, the Undergraduate Student Senate, Graduate Student Assembly, Student Dormitory Council (SDC), PanHellenic Association (PHA), Interfraternity Council (IFC), and Multicultural Greek Council (MGC).

There are four elected Student Government positions that represent the CMU student body: the President, Vice President, Vice President for Organizations, and Vice President for Finance. These positions are elected in April for the next academic year by the entire student body. The Vice Presidents for Organizations and Finance represent and advocate for Student Government Recognized Student Organizations. There are 280 recognized, student-run organizations. These organizations all receive a portion of the Student Activities Fee that is managed by the Vice President for Finance.

The Undergraduate Student Senate represents the undergraduate student population through representatives from each college. There is one representative for each 140 students within each college. The election process occurs in April for the next academic year.

The Graduate Student Assembly represents the graduate student body. Representatives are selected in an informal election process within each Graduate Department. The number of representatives is determined by the number of graduate students within the department. This process occurs throughout the academic year.

The Student Dormitory Council represents and advocates for the resident students living in on campus housing to the administration, to other campus organizations, and to the general public. Each dorm has a representative that attends the SDC General Body.

The Panhellenic Association is the governing council for the 6 sororities on campus.

The Interfraternity Council is a self-governing body representing the 12 member fraternities at Carnegie Mellon.

The Multicultural Greek Council is the governing body for the 3 culturally-based fraternities and sororities on campus.
",--,"CMU does not have an overarching “governing body.” There is a President’s Council, however, there are different committees that are a part of decision making at the University.",**,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,"Students have a formal role in decision-making in regard to one or more of the following: 

• Establishing organizational mission, vision, and/or goals 
The University has created many avenues to seek student feedback and input through student advisory committees. These are held on the departmental level, as well as on the university level. For example, there is a Presidential Student Advisory Committee that the University President takes point and a diverse selection of students from all majors and years have an opportunity to learn about what is ahead for the University, plus share ideas and feedback to the President.

• Establishing new policies, programs, or initiatives 
Carnegie Mellon University students have a formal role in decision-making in regards to establishing new policies, programs, and initiatives. In order for a new student policy to be created or revised, there is an official vetting process. The Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly need the opportunity to review drafts and vote on the final version. 

Here are a couple of examples where students have had  the opportunity to create programs: The Undergraduate Student Senate initiated through a campus-wide referendum (vote) to implement a media fee to be charged to all undergraduate students to pay for a newspaper program, Collegiate Readership Program, through USA Today. This was supported by The Board of Trustees. Another example where students create new initiatives is a newly established credit course on wellness and being successful at CMU, called Thrive@CMU.

• Strategic and long-term planning 
• Existing or prospective physical resources 
As the University has renewed its 10 year Master Plan, students were represented on the Campus Design & Review Committee. The Campus Design & Review Committee also approves other additions and changes to campus. As part of the master plan, there are extensions being planned for the Jared L. Cohon University Center. Representatives from a couple student organizations related to theatre and media technology were invited to weigh in on aspects of the new Studio Theatre being built in the extension. 
The Facilities Management Services has created several task forces and advisory committees to obtain student feedback and input on the physical campus. 

• Budgeting, staffing and financial planning 
Students are also invited to participate and provide feedback in the university staff selection process to meet candidates that were invited for on-campus interviews.
The VP for Campus Affairs has established a strong relationship with Student Government regarding University financial transparency and updating them regarding tuition increases.

• Communications processes and transparency practices 
• Prioritization of programs and projects 
The Dean of Students meets bi-weekly with Student Government Executives to update them on campus wide initiatives/programs/issues that might impact students in order to gather feedback, ideas, and share concerns.

Colorado College Student Government Association, CCSGA 
The Colorado College Student Government Association is the official democratically elected student government at Colorado College. CCSGA is constitutionally chartered “as a source of support for student organizations and events, a forum for cooperative action and a voice calling for progress.” With a $268,000 budget, CCSGA manages student group recognition and funding. It also works to empower students through the student concerns committee. 

President's Council 
The President's Council is a representative body of students that serves in an advisory role to the President of Colorado College and as ambassadors for the college.  The Council meets with the President and/or various college and community leaders at least once per block.

The student representative to the Board of Trustees is elected yearly. The student speaks on behalf of the student body and participates in voting, committees, and project teams.

In addition, students serve on a variety of other governing bodies including: the Athletics Board, the Budget Committee, the Children's Center Advisory Committee, the Committee on Instruction, the Curriculum Committee, the Dean's Advisory Committee, the First Year Experience Committee, the Information Technology and Library Board, and the Student Conduct Committee. ",True,"Every year, a student representative serves on the Board of Trustees. The role of the Student Trustee is to speak on the behalf of the student body and to make the Board aware of any pressing and relevant concerns that students may have. The Student Trustee is a voting member and serves on both Standing Committees and Strategic Project Teams.  

Students interested in the position must apply, campaign, and receive one of the top three  votes from the student body. Then, the three favored candidates interview with the Board, which makes the final call on the position. ",**,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,"Establishing Organizational Mission, Vision, and/or Goals:
-Even though the Board of Trustees (including its student representative) has no formal role in the construction of the College's mission statement, it plays a crucial role in its interpretation and adherence. During all decision-making processes, the Board carefully considers how the proposed action, program, or budget will fit in with the College's stated vision and goals.  

Establishing New Policies, Programs, or Initiatives:
-On a blockly basis, the President's Council meets with college staff and administration to learn about current policies, program, and initiatives and to offer feedback and recommendations.  

Strategic and Long-Term Planning:
-During the development of the Strategic Plan, students serving on the President's Council engaged the President of the College in several conversations regarding their vision for the plan. In particular, they gave suggestions regarding the plan's recommendation to rennovate Tutt Library, voicing what they hoped to see from both the design and offered resources.  
-The Student Trustee, one of thirty-two voting members on the Board, participated in the vote to approve the College's strategic plan. Following the plan's approval, the Student Trustee had an opportunity to join his choice of the four Strategic Project Teams composed to carry out the goals outlined the plan.  The teams included (1) campaign planning, (2) library planning, (3) campus master plan/ master communications plan, and (4) environmental stewardship & innovation. 
-In addition to this, every committee created for and from the strategic plan had student members serving on it. 

Existing or Prospective Physical Resources:
-During the group's blockly meetings with college staff and administrators, the President's Council discusses how CC can revamp its current resources and introduce new ones to enhance their value and usage on campus.  
-CCSGA has proposed suggestions regarding additional study spaces on campus and the use of Honen Arena for college events.   
-Students may participate as part of the Design Review Board also.
-Additionally, the student representative to the Board of Trustees has had the opportunity to vote for or against budgets, the campus master plan, and the campus master communications plan.  

Budgeting, Staffing, and Financial Planning:
-As a voting member on the Board of Trustees, the Student Trustee can vote for or against the budgets included in Board proposals.  
-The Student Trustee has the option to participate in any of the Board's four Standing Committees: Budget and Finance, Investment, Governance, and Audit. 

Communications Processes and Transparency Practices: 
-In a conversation with CC's Chief Technology Officer, the President's Council identified several strategies for revitalizing the College's Events/Student Digest (daily emails sent out to CC students notifying them of events, activities, and programs on campus) in order to foster a stronger system for campus communication.  
-In an effort to increase communication within the CC community, CCSGA has been collaborating with college administration to develop an umbrella website that provides a centralized online location featuring the promoted events of student groups on campus.

Shared Governance includes the Faculty Senate, the Student Assembly (undergraduate), the Employee Assembly, the University Assembly and the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly. 

The Student Assembly is the undergraduate student government at Cornell University, and deals with quality of life issues for students, making sure that student issues are heard and addressed. The assembly has legislative authority over the policies of the Office of the Dean of Students and the Department of Campus Life, and establishes the undergraduate Student Activity Fee and guidelines for its distribution. Every Cornell student has the opportunity to voice concerns during the open microphone period held at the beginning of each meeting. 

The Graduate and Professional Student Assembly brings together Cornell’s 7,000 graduate and professional (M.B.A., J.D., D.V.M.) students to address non-academic issues of common concern. Drawing upon the strengths of our diverse constituencies, we work with the university administration to improve the quality of life at the University. The GPSA engages the needs and concerns of its constituents, communicating these directly to the University administration. They also appoint graduate and professional students to university committees, where they have a direct voice in decision-making processes. 

The University Assembly is rather unique in higher education in that it is constituted by members appointed by the constituent assemblies (except for 2 members elected by the undergraduate students directly to seats on the UA), and has the authority to ""examine matters which concern the welfare of a substantial segment of the campus community and may make recommendations thereon to the President or other appropriate officers of the university; and is tasked with representing and voicing the interests of faculty, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students."" Thus, there are four undergraduates and two graduate/professional students on the University Assembly representing the student voice on any such matters.",True,"Cornell is one of the few universities in the country with two students, two faculty, and one employee as full voting members on their 64-member Board.

Trustees help determine major policy directions and have an important role in safeguarding the integrity of the university. Trustees serve on numerous committees and task forces of the Board and as ex-officio members of the Student and Employee Assemblies.

According to the Charter of the University, ""two trustees are to be elected from among and by the membership of the university's student body at Ithaca."" As such, the undergraduate body elects a Trustee in alternating years with the graduate and professional student body.

",--,,**,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,,True,"Furman University has a strong tradition of shared governance, with clearly defined roles for faculty, administration, and trustees.  Members of the faculty are expected to serve on committees and to attend and cast votes at faculty meetings, held 6-8 times per academic year.  University faculty meetings function as a “committee of the whole,” meaning that there is no faculty senate, and every faculty member may vote.  The Nominating Committee proposes nominees for officers of the faculty (chair, vice-chair, and recorder) and for faculty committees. The slates are then voted on by the faculty at large.  There are 19 faculty committees specified by the Faculty Constitution; in addition, faculty serve on a variety of administrative committees, special committees, and ad-hoc committees.

Article II, section 1 of the Faculty Constitution defines membership in the faculty as “those persons in the teaching and research faculty who are employed by Furman on contracts for teaching and research for half-time or more, those persons who are principal officers of the administration (see Bylaw 3), the professional library staff, commissioned members of the ROTC staff, and all tenured persons.”  Section 2 states that “Voting privileges shall be limited to the members of the faculty as defined in Section 1 above.”  Adjunct faculty and those on contracts for less than half time are not considered voting members of the faculty by our constitution, but may attend faculty meetings as observers if they wish.",True,"As with almost all private universities, the ultimate governing body of Furman University is its Board of Trustees.  Only Trustees can vote at these meetings, but faculty representatives are invited to submit reports and participate in discussions.  The Chair of the Faculty, elected through a vote of the entire faculty as described in the preceding question, is invited to the entire Board of Trustees meeting, and can attend any committee session.  In addition, there are faculty representatives on each of the nine Board of Trustees committees, each of whom is invited to give a report and participate in the discussion.  These representatives are appointed by the University President based on nominations from the Chair of the Faculty.  For at least the last three years, the Faculty Chair’s nominees have all been approved and appointed by the President.  The university also has the President's Cabinent, which meets approximately every two weeks and includes the Vice-Presidents and selected other officers.  The elected Chair of the Faculty is a member of the President’s Cabinet and invited to participate fully in its deliberations. ",**,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,"The document entitled “Vision 2020” is Furman’s official statement of its character, values, culture, identity, mission, and goals for the future.  This document was implemented three years ago (2011) after an intensive period of discussion and consultation, which was led by a strategic planning committee including representatives of the faculty, along with students, administrators, alumni, and trustees. 

The faculty of Furman University, as a body, have primary responsibility for academic policies, programs, and initiatives.  According to the Faculty Constitution, “The faculty of Furman University shall be responsible for setting academic policy, determining the curriculum, defining requirements for degrees, and conducting academic instruction.  The faculty and academic administration shall devise and implement the most feasible and effective means of executing academic policy, utilizing the curriculum and providing academic instruction.”

The “Vision 2020” document was the result of a process of strategic planning with faculty representation on the committee.  Strategic and long-term planning are also the main responsibilities of the Board of Trustees.

Decisions regarding physical resources are primarily made by the university administration and trustees.  Faculty representation on these bodies has already been described.  For example, the Grounds and Buildings Committee of the Board of Trustees makes decisions regarding capital construction projects, and a faculty representative has input into their deliberations.

The staffing matter for which faculty have the most direct input involves faculty tenure, promotion, and merit pay.  The Faculty Status Committee, an elected standing committee of the faculty, reviews all such matters, provides campus-wide uniformity of standards, and advises the Dean as to the final outcomes.  Most other matters of budget, staffing, and financial planning are controlled by the administration and trustees, but once again there are established channels of faculty input, including representation on the President’s cabinet and Board of Trustees.  Two other recent examples also illustrate the faculty’s role in such matters.  In 2012-13, a large task force termed the Joint Working Group was set up to consider the university’s response to the current economic climate, including increasing the efficiency of current programs (both academic and non-academic) and the development of new revenue streams.  Membership of the Joint Working Group was equally distributed among faculty, administration, and trustees.  More recently, when the Vice-President for Academic Affairs needed to take steps to reduce the cost of the academic program, he requested the formation of an ad-hoc Cost Containment Advisory Committee, composed of eight members of the faculty who were appointed by the Faculty Chair in consultation with the Nominating Committee.

One of the standing faculty committees specified by our constitution is the Faculty-Administration Liaison Committee, whose elected members are “responsible for ascertaining the faculty's views and concerns regarding University matters and transmitting these--with suitable information--to the appropriate officers of the administration. It shall also convey to the faculty pertinent views and concerns of the administration.”",--,--

There are a variety of ways for graduate students to participate in the Graduate Student Government (GSG). Students can run for office in the general election held each March, attend a GSG Assembly meeting, serve on a University Committee, or volunteer at a GSG-sponsored event. The GSG Assembly can make nominations for the other committees of the U-Council, including the Priorities Committee, which makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees each January on the allocation of the University’s operating budget, and the Rights and Rules Committee, which sets codes of conduct for the University and its students, faculty and administration.",True,"The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members. Each year the current junior and senior classes, and the two most recently graduated classes, elect a member of the senior class as an Alumni Trustee.

Additionally, the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC), created in 1969, serves as a forum for the discussion of issues. The CPUC examines and makes recommendations on questions of policy that govern and affect the welfare of the University community. Chaired by the University’s president, the council is composed of faculty, staff, students and alumni. There are 12 Undergraduates on the CPUC, including the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government and 10 undergraduates elected at large from the student body in April. There are 7 graduate students, at least one from each division.

Much of the work of the CPUC is conducted through its standing committees or through special committees. The president of the University is the presiding officer of the Council and of the Executive Committee. The committee has 14 members, including, in addition to the President, six faculty members (at least one from each division and one nontenured), three undergraduates (including the Chair of the Undergraduate Student Government), two graduate students, and two members selected by the Council from among the staff and alumni representatives. The Executive Committee sets the Council's agenda, recommends the appointment of members of Council committees, considers any matter within the jurisdiction of the Council, and serves as an informal advisory body to the president.

The Priorities Committee is a subcommittee of the CPUC and serves in an advisory role to the president. The Committee reviews the operating budget of the University, considers issues that arise in the course of the preparation of that budget, and reviews plans for the development of the University. The provost chairs the committee, which also includes the dean of the faculty, the executive vice president, the treasurer, six faculty members (at least one from each division and one non-tenured), four undergraduates and two graduate students (chosen with due consideration to the variety of interests represented in the student body), and one member from one of the other groups represented.

Students are also involved in the strategic planning process by participating in campus task forces. The strategic planning process will be closely integrated with the University’s campus planning initiative, which will begin in academic year 2014/2015.

The Board of Trustees, the Academic Council, the Provost, the President, the Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Student Affairs, and the Chief Information Officer convene almost 50 committees for yearlong terms to address a variety of issues affecting all walks of student life.

(1) the President of the University
(2) tenure-line faculty: Assistant, Associate, and Full Professor
(3) nontenure-line faculty: Associate and Full Professor followed by the parenthetical notation (Teaching), (Performance), (Applied Research), or (Clinical)
(4) nontenure-line research faculty: Assistant Professor (Research), Associate Professor (Research), Professor (Research)
(5) Senior Fellows in specified policy centers and institutes
(6) certain specified officers of academic administration.

In the Spring of 1968, the Academic Council approved the charter for a Senate to be composed of 55 representatives elected by the Hare System of Proportional Representation and, as ex officio nonvoting members, deans of the academic schools and certain major officers of academic administration.

In the allocation of representation, each school constitutes a major constituency. The Senate may create from time to time other major constituencies as conditions warrant. Approximately one-half of the representatives are allocated to constituencies on the basis of the number of students in those constituencies and the remainder on the basis of the number of members of the Academic Council from each constituency.

The Faculty Senate is the legislative body of the Academic Council and has responsibility for academic and research policy as well as the authority to grant degrees. In addition to formulating policy, the Senate reviews, via the committees,  two types of curriculum proposals, broadly speaking: proposals or reviews of degree granting programs, and, periodically, broad curriculum reforms resulting from ad-hoc university level review committees which examine university wide curriculum such as general education requirements, writing requirements and other similar classes all undergraduates must take. The Senate also reviews interdisciplinary degree granting programs (IDPs) as well as proposals for new degree granting programs, including honors and joint degree programs (JDPs) and name changes of departments and programs.  

The Senate discharges its academic and research policy and oversight responsibilities via the hard work of seven standing Committees of the Academic Council (https://facultysenate.stanford.edu/academic-council-committees). These committees are charged by the Senate.  There are four Senate committees: the Committee on Committees, the Steering Committee, the Committee of Tellers and the Planning and Policy Board.",True,"The Senate is composed of 55 voting members serving staggered 2 year terms and 15 ex officio members. Standing guest seats are reserved for the student representatives, the Registrar,  the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, the Vice Provost for Student Affairs, the Vice Provost of Faculty Development and Diversity and the Emeriti Council representative. The Chair, Vice Chair and Steering Committee members are elected from within the Senate body. 

Members of the Academic Council are eligible to serve on the Senate and are placed in units based on school and discipline. Senators are elected annually by the Hare System of Proportional Representation; all Academic Council faculty may vote for faculty within their unit. Elected Senators serve as free agents, not as representatives of a particular program, unit or school. The number of seats per unit is allocated relative to the size of the school and disciplines within that unit. 

The Steering Committee is elected by the incoming Senate from a slate of Senators nominated by the Committee on Committees. One of the Steering Committee's first tasks is to appoint members of the incoming Senate to serve on the Committee on Committees. Each Board of Trustees subcommittee has at least one faculty member appointed via the Committee on Committees and the Nominations Committee.

STUDY OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AT STANFORD
The Report of the Study of Undergraduate Education at Stanford (SUES) is a 127-page document published in 2012. It was presented by the SUES committee, co-chaired by James Campbell, Professor of History, and Susan McConnell, Professor of Biology.  Over 100 faculty participated in the two-year study. It is widely regarded as a landmark document and already the basic undergraduate curriculum has begun to change substantively as a result of its findings.

REPORT ON ONLINE EDUCATION
A report on Online Education was given on April 19, 2012 and was the first formal internal presentation of this new phenomenon in higher education: the presentation of college courses online, soon to be known as MOOC’s (Massive Online Open Courses).  It led to the establishment of a new office, the office of the Vice Provost for Online Education.  Stanford is one of the leaders in this field and the work is driven by members of the Academic Council.

The SA represents undergraduate students before the university administration, continuously advocating for their best interests. They also provide a wide range of services, oversee an ever-growing roster of clubs and organizations, and put on memorable events all year long.

The University at Buffalo’s Student Association is unique amongst SUNY schools in that they are entirely student run. SA is funded through student fees and ultimately overseen by executive officers, the SA Senate, and the SA Student Assembly all of which are comprised entirely of undergraduate students. We are your Student Association.

The SA president also is a member of the UB Stewardship Committee.  For more information see: http://www.sa.buffalo.edu/

The Graduate Student The Graduate Student Association (GSA) is the representative body for graduate students at the State University of New York at Buffalo and leaders are directly elected by their peers. Its two key purposes can be divided into representation and services. Its funds are derived from the Mandatory Student Fee and are used to pay GSA staff and fund numerous programs and services offered to GSA members.

The GSA President is the key representative to all of the administration, such as the Dean of the Graduate School, the Provost and the President of the University. GSA also represents graduate students beyond the University. The National Association of Graduate-Professional Students, of which GSA is a member, is an organization that exists across the country to represent the needs of graduate and professional students.

The Graduate Student Association was created in 1962 to give graduate students a voice. In the 1960s, it was the creation of a student lounge in the New Norton Union (today Norton Hall) that originally got GSA on its feet. From that beginning, GSA expanded to providing services for graduate students as well. It also became one of the caretakers in what Dennis Black, Vice President of Student Affairs, calls “the great experiment.” This “great experiment” was to allow students to control their own Mandatory Student Fee, that is its collection, amount and disbursement, for programs that the students feel they need.

University of Connecticut,2016-03-25,2016-03-25 18:15:16,rich.miller@uconn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"An undergraduate student government has existed at the University of Connecticut in Storrs in various forms and under different names since 1894. Originally, it was composed of nine elected students who worked with the faculty “upon matters of government of the college.” By 1913, the organization was called the Student Organization, and its members were the two hundred thirty-nine students enrolled at Connecticut Agricultural College.

In 1921, the government was reorganized and a standing committee called the Student Senate was formed as the executive branch. The Senate adopted a constitution and became known as the Associated Student Government (ASG). The constitution outlined the duties of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the ASG, which was modeled after the federal government. The Student Senate continued as the core of student political power until 1973 when the ASG dissolved. In the following academic year, the ASG was replaced by the Federation of Students and Service Organizations (FSSO). The Senate was replaced by a Central Committee.

In 1980, the FSSO was replaced by the Undergraduate Student Government (USG), and the Student Assembly became the representative student body. The Undergraduate Student Government bodies have piloted (and funded) the launch of every other major student organization on campus including: The Daily Campus, WHUS, SUBOG, IFC, and RHA.

USG is recognized by the University Of Connecticut Board Of Trustees as one of the five governing bodies on campus (along with the Board of Trustees, and the Graduate Student Senate). USG is the primary voice of students to all audiences, and actively partakes in the university-wide decision making process through representation and advocacy. (http://usg.uconn.edu/about/)

Much of the work done at a leadership level will be shepherded by the newly formed Faculty Senate. Details of their work is found in the University Faculty Senate Charter: 
""The University Faculty Senate provides information, advice, and recommendations to the provost, the university president, and the Board of Trustees regarding faculty interests and concerns as they bear upon the life and operation of the institution. It has the obligation to communicate to the faculty appropriate information and the results of its deliberations and to carry out such further functions as may be assigned to it by the faculty consistent with the bylaws of the university. On matters for which the Board of Trustees has delegated primary responsibility to the university faculty, the power of review or final decision lodged in the Board of Trustees or delegated by it to the university president should be exercised adversely to the recommendations of the university faculty only after careful consideration of the perspective of the faculty and thoughtful deliberation. If reasons for such decisions are offered, they shall be communicated to the University Faculty Senate. It is desirable that the university faculty should, following such communication, have opportunity for further consideration and further transmittal of its views to the university president or the Board of Trustees.

B. The University Faculty Senate, as the representative body of the faculty, shall have
primary responsibility for the following matters:
1. Providing recommendations to the appropriate bodies for all academic policies that relate to two or more schools;
2. Approving general education courses and considering cross-school curricular matters after they have gone through individual school processes. In the appropriate cases, the Senate shall consult with the provost and bring a joint recommendation to the full university faculty for its approval (see Article V for approval jurisdiction and procedures);
3. Recommending admission qualification standards for first-year and transfer applicants through the Undergraduate Admissions Committee (or its successor);
4. Providing recommendations to the appropriate bodies on student activities policies that affect students in two or more schools;
5. Conducting regularly scheduled faculty reviews of academic deans and the provost, conveying results to the relevant dean and the provost (in the case of deans) and the provost and university president (in the case of the provost) to inform the performance review for which the provost and/or the university president have ultimate responsibility.
C. The University Faculty Senate shall also, when such matters relate to two or more schools:
1. Consult regularly with the administration and, as appropriate, with the Board of Trustees regarding the development of the university’s academic objectives, and the nature, range, and pace of its efforts;
2. Consult with the administration regarding general policies governing faculty status and workloads;
3. Consult with the provost regarding the relative emphasis given to the various elements of the educational, scholarly, and creative work at the university level, such as the weights given to teaching and scholarly and creative work in performance and promotion reviews;
4. Consult with the administration regarding the general principles and policies governing the compensation of university employees;
5. Discuss with the vice president for enrollment management and the provost significant changes in the size or composition of the student body;
6. Consult with the administration regarding non-academic decisions that may have a direct impact on the academic life of the faculty and students through the established committee structure;
7. Receive regular reports, typically annually, from and consult with the vice president for business and finance regarding budgeting for academic programs and academic support programs and for the existing or prospective physical resources used for educational purposes;
8. Communicate the faculty’s priorities to and receive regular reports from the vice president for information services regarding the existing or prospective technological resources used for educational purposes;
9. Participate in short-range and long-range planning for the allocation of resources by receiving regular reports, typically annually, from and consulting with the vice president of business and finance and by the participation of the Senate president, or his or her designee, as an ex-officio, non-voting member of the University Planning and Priorities Committee or its successor constituted by the president of the university to advise him or her on university resource allocation;
 * At the time of the University Faculty Senate’s establishment (June 15, 2015), this practice occurs at the meetings of the University Planning and Priorities Committee and in discussions following presentations by the vice president for business and finance. 
10. Communicate the faculty’s priorities to and receive regular reports, typically annually, from the vice president for advancement regarding the development of the university’s goals for capital campaigns and other major fundraising efforts;
11. Participate in searches for university presidents, provosts, and (as appropriate) senior leadership by nominating candidates for appointment as faculty representatives on search committees and, when requested by the Board of Trustees or the university president, offering feedback on candidates in those searches""",http://president.richmond.edu/board-of-trustees/index.html,"http://facultygovernance.richmond.edu/Ch_III/index.html

The Student Government Association’s Student Senate is a governing body of over seventy undergraduate students that represent the interests and well being of all students at the University of Tennessee.

In addition, OSA is also responsible for the distribution of $9 million in segregated fees that fully fund the Student Recreation and Wellness Center, Reeve Memorial Union, Children’s Learning and Care Center, and athletics.

Routes are designed to focus on the campus and the needs of the students, whether their destination is entertainment, employment, necessity, or academics. As gas prices continue to rise; and insurance rates increase; and maintenance costs soar; this program will save the students money by offering a far cheaper alternative than using a personal vehicle.
