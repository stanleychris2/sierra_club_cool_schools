Energy Efficiency.  Purchase equipment that is Energy Star-rated (or, if there is no Energy Star rating, equipment that is highly energy efficient).  Energy Star is a program helping businesses and individuals protect the environment through superior energy efficiency.
Shipping Materials.  Purchase products that are shipped in containers that are returnable or reusable and made from recycled content (i.e. cardboard boxes).  Also request bulk packaging when multiple items are ordered for delivery at the same time.
Recycled Content.  Purchase products made with recycled content suitable for the intended use.  Look for a high percentage of post-consumer content.  ‘Post-Consumer’ is material that has served its intended purpose and has been discarded for disposal or recovery by a business or consumer.  Other recycled content includes post industrial wastes which are by-products of a manufacturing process that would normally not be reused in the process.

DATE OF ISSUANCE: This policy was originally issued to campus on 10/5/90 as a presidential policy memo, Recycling Policy for Carnegie Mellon. 

ACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENTS/UNITS: Questions on policy content should be directed to Barbara Kviz, Environmental Coordinator, Facilities Management Services, x8-7858 or  

ABSTRACT: Describes the university's recycling program and waste reduction efforts. 

RELATED INFORMATION: Carnegie Mellon Recycling and Environmental Practices 
Policy for Carnegie Mellon

This is to announce the adoption of the following Recycling Policy for the university. 

Carnegie Mellon University is committed to recycling the materials it uses and to minimizing non-hazardous waste. It is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to support these efforts that will protect our environment by conserving resources and preserving rapidly diminishing landfill space. The implementation of a campus-wide recycling program is the first step toward developing a comprehensive environmental policy for Carnegie Mellon. Recycling is just one part of a much larger program of activities through which Carnegie Mellon will take an increasingly active role to further understanding and preservation of our environment in the years to come. 

Facilities Management Services is responsible for the implementation of Carnegie Mellon's recycling program. The Environmental Coordinator in this department will be responsible for the management of the recycling program and coordination of waste reduction efforts on campus. Each department will designate, in writing, an official Recycling Liaison who will coordinate departmental recycling efforts with the Carnegie Mellon Environmental Coordinator. 

The entire campus community is expected to actively participate in Carnegie Mellon's Recycling Program and waste reduction efforts. This involves three distinct activities. 
1.Recycling of paper, cardboard and beverage cans (aluminum and bimetal). 
2.Source Reduction: This includes but is not limited to making double-sided copies, increased use of electronic mail instead of memos, reuse/resale of surplus furniture, etc. 
3.Purchasing products made from recycled materials. The long-term success of recycling programs in this country depends on the creation of markets for recycled materials. All departments should purchase recycled products wherever economically feasible. 

Recycling programs already functioning on campus are encouraged to continue and expand provided that they do not hinder the campus-wide recycling program. Individuals responsible for such programs must provide recycling volume data to the Carnegie Mellon University Environmental Coordinator to permit the university to comply with Pennsylvania Act 101 (Pennsylvania Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 101 of 1988). 
","Carnegie Mellon University purchases 30%-recycled paper for our large campus wide paper purchase.  However, the University cannot limit its purchases to only recycled paper due some of the printers requiring virgin paper.

All purchasing at the University is decentralized, so the paper purchasing expenditures provided from our central warehouse is for the majority of paper purchased on campus, but not all of the paper purchased.",True,**,--,56061.0,--,--,1550.0,191179.0,http://www.cmu.edu/environment/,"The Recycling Policy includes a section to purchase recycled content materials.

","The College adopted its first sustainable paper purchasing policy in the spring of 2007 based on a project researched by a public policy and environment course. The policy aimed to significantly increase the purchase of recycled paper and to reduce paper consumption at the College. The College has taken this policy seriously and purchased a significant amount of recycled paper since then, while reducing overall paper use as well. In 2014, the College streamlined its sustainable purchasing policies into one policy. The new policy maintains the same standard for purchasing: a minimum of 30% post-consumer recycled office paper that is FSC certified. The new policy also puts a specific target on minimizing the purchase of paper by reducing costs 20% by 2020.

The College's communications office prints materials using post-consumer, FSC-certified paper for all of its pieces including annual reports, periodicals, and admission materials. Since 2011, the communications office stopped printing the academic catalog with the exception of 100 copies for faculty; catalog distribution is now entirely online. In 2014, the College distributed the bi-annual
institutional report (IR) electronically instead of printing it. The communications office also uses electronic ""flipbook"" software to share periodicals like the Bulletin and the AR online, without having to print as many copies; in fact, this effort has reduced printing from approximately 7,000 to 4,000 copies per year. The communications office has also worked with other offices, like sustainability, to help
them transition their own periodicals into the flipbook software. Examples include the Green Guide, our strategic plan, and the graduate catalogue. In 2014, Admissions have modified their communication plan for incomplete and complete applicants to eliminate more paper- routine correspondence is communicated electronically. There are still some communications -- acceptance letters, change of status (transfer) and certificates of enrollment--that are send via paper.

All offices on campus use recycled paper as well. The largest purchasers include computer services, which use a minimum of 50% post-consumer recycled content paper and the academic departments which use a minimum of 30% post-consumer recycled content paper. Computer services has also switched to using soy-based toner in its printers, and all printers are programmed to print double-sided
in the library.

To further reduce use, GOOS paper (Good-on-one-side) boxes have been installed by many of the major printers on campus serving as a first resort for mis-printings. The sustainability office waste diversion crew brings this GOOS paper to the Freepo where members of the community can pick up the paper for note-taking. Outdated stationary from Admissions is donated to the Office Freepo and used as invitations for sustainability events, for holiday letter-writing events, for letter-writing campaigns, and for thank you cards. Several other departments, as well as individuals, donate old notebooks to the Office Freepo as well, which further reduces the need to purchase paper.

2.5 Purchasing
NC State purchasing decisions are guided by total cost of ownership and total life
cycle cost. Any purchase by NC State will improve the environmental performance of its supply chain with consideration given to toxicity, recycled content, energy and water efficiency, rapidly renewable resources, and local production and manufacturing. Purchase decisions will improve the social responsibility of the supply chain, production working conditions and the use of historically underutilized businesses.

2.5.1 Environmentally and socially responsible attributes
• Include environmentally and socially responsible attributes whenever this
does not infringe on the statute-driven purchasing processes defined by
the State of North Carolina.
• Consider all phases of a product or service to determine its environmental
impacts including: raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing,
packaging, distribution, operation, maintenance, disposal, potential for
reuse and ability to be recycled.
• Include environmentally and socially responsible attributes in
specifications, statements of work, and procurement of goods and
services.

2.5.2 Expansion of environmentally and socially responsible purchasing
• Seek environmentally and socially responsible purchasing for products and
services by selecting those that comply with the following current and
credible environmental and social standards:
o Green Seal certified for cleaning supplies, paints (no VOC),
windows, doors, flooring and adhesives
o Forest Stewardship Council certified for office paper, toilet paper,
every type/use of paper
o Green Guard standards for indoor environments such as paints,
furniture and bedding
o Cradle to Cradle production standards
o Purchasing from sources that feature adequate safeguards for
endangered forests and indigenous people

2.5.3 Procurement of paper products and initiatives that minimize paper
use
• Purchase paper and tissue products made from 50% post-consumer
recycled content. In the absence of 50% post-consumer, purchase the
highest post-consumer recycled content or highest pre-consumer recycled
material content.
• Use photocopy practices that minimize paper use and reduce costs
including:
o Duplex (double-sided) printing and photocopying
o Use of digital file management and imaging software
o Enhance capabilities for electronic document creation and storage
o Eliminating unnecessary printing
o Using the maximum margins allowable by University branding
guidelines to fit more content on each sheet of paper
• By January 1, 2015, 50% of paper products will comply with this regulation
and will increase by 25% each year until 100% of all paper and tissue
products comply.

2.5.4 Energy Star® equipment and electronics
• Purchase Energy Star, or better, electronic office equipment, including but
not limited to computers, monitors, printers, scanners, photocopy
machines, facsimile machines and other such equipment.
• Purchase Energy Star or better appliances and other energy consuming
equipment when available.
• Budget for Energy Star or better for equipment listed for requests for
proposals, specifications, and contracts for products or services.

2.5.5 EPEAT computers
• Purchase new computers that meet the Electronic Product Environmental
Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Silver or Gold Energy Efficiency standards.

2.5.6 Adherence to the NC State Design and Construction Guidelines
• Require all members of the NC State community adhere to the Design and
Construction Guidelines regarding material choices.

2.5.7 The procurement of the following is discouraged to the maximum
extent feasible and within limitation of existing laws and regulations:
● Asbestos-containing materials
● Mercury-containing materials
● Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
● Hazardous substances requiring special handling and disposal
● Polystyrene products and packaging
● Bleached, virgin paper with 0% post-consumer recycled content

","The Sustainability SOP included measures for ensuring the guidelines are followed as such:

2.5.8 The director of Materials Management structures procurement
procedures to:
• Include a review of compliance with this SOP as a part of regularly
scheduled review of delegated procurement. Include comments regarding 
the extent of compliance and suggestions for improvements in reports
furnished to Deans, Directors, Department Heads and Vice Chancellors
(as applicable).
• Review requisitions received from departments and units of the University.
Suggest environmentally and socially responsible alternatives for
consideration by the requestor.
• Actively seek sources for environmentally and socially responsible
products. Materials Management identifies and posts links to appropriate
search tools that may be of use to the campus community in selecting
environmentally preferable product alternatives, such as the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database of environmentally
preferable products.
• Establish and actively promote the use of term contracts and University
specific convenience contracts for environmentally and socially
responsible goods and services commonly used by campus. Upon
expiration of existing contracts, evaluate opportunities for replacement with
more environmentally and socially responsible options. Post all contract
bid opportunities on the NC Department of Administration’s Division of
Purchase and Contract Interactive Purchasing System website.
• Appoint one or more environmentally and socially responsible procurement
coordinators with responsibility for researching opportunities for
environmentally preferable goods and services, issuing solicitations to
establish contracts, and promoting the goods and services to the campus
community. Establish an outreach and education program designed to
inform campus about the availability of and benefits associated with such
products.
• Encourage all vendors to offer environmentally and socially responsible
product promotions. Actively market these opportunities to campus via the
Materials Management website, e-mail and other venues likely to reach
the campus community at-large.
• Actively promote the reuse of surplus property available at the Surplus
Property Office as an alternative to procurement of new products.
• Aggressively seek multiple sources and promote competitive bidding for
the environmentally and socially preferable products specified by
requesting departments and units.
• Develop and implement the use of standard contract provisions promoting
the policies established herein.",True,**,--,--,4917.42,--,3595.4,8512.82,http://sustainability.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sustainability-SOP.pdf,--

Preamble
Smith College recognizes that the sourcing and transportation of paper involves unnecessary impact to
the climate and ecosystems. This policy has been developed to:
• raise awareness of these issues within the campus community
• reduce the use of copier and printer paper
• reduce the use of all types of paper for general communication within the college
• reduce the impact of the paper that is used
Implementation of this policy will have environmental and financial benefits.
Policy
• All paper used for copiers and printers on campus will contain at least 30% post-consumer
recycled content. (This is consistent with state and federal paper procurement guidelines). Nonrecycled
content should be sourced from Forest Stewardship Council certified sustainably
managed forests (or equivalent).
• All offices and departments will purchase paper that meets or exceeds this standard.
• The WB Mason purchasing website will be modified such that only printer and copier
paper that meets this standard is available via the Smith College account.
• We recommend that paper be purchased via the WB Mason website rather than having
individual departments purchase paper from off-campus retailers e.g. Staples, often at
additional expense, labor and carbon emissions.
Any printing and copying equipment purchased or leased by the college should be capable of utilizing
paper that meets the above standard.","All paper used for copiers and printers on campus contain at least 30% post-consumer recycled content, consistent with state and federal paper procurement guidelines. Norecycled content should be sourced from Forest Stewardship Council certified sustainably managed forests (or equivalent). 

All Smith College offices and departments will purchase paper that meets or exceeds this standard.

The Forest Stewardship Council promotes responsible management for the world’s forest, and subsequently advocates for the purchasing of paper products that are environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable. The FSC asserts that the current needs for paper products can be met through sustainable forestry without compromising the health of the world’s forests. 

Recycling is an effective way to conserve resources, minimize waste and protect the environment. Stevens, as an institution, will demonstrate a purchasing preference for office and paper products that have recycled content, and are therefore certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This preference will signify Stevens commitment to sustainable practices that are beneficial to the institution and the health of the forests that are relied on for daily business practices. 

In addition to purchasing FSC certified recycled paper, Stevens will commit to limit the use of paper and consumables by printing two-sided whenever possible, using “draft” mode to use less ink and toner, print “multiple pages per page” where feasible, and store electronic copies instead of paper copies. By purchasing recycled paper, either 30% post-consumer recycled or 100% post-consumer waste recycled content paper, the university will be able to see significant cost savings and show the Stevens commitment to environmental sustainability.  

Stevens has committed to sustainability and has an institution-wide stated preference to purchase office paper that has recycled content, and to be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.  Additionally, any office printer paper that is purchased through the Purchasing Department will be exclusively office paper that contains 90-100 percent of post-consumer FSC certified office printer paper.  This stated preference is not mandatory, however the second part of this policy will impact anyone that utilizes purchasing for the office printer supplies.

Summary

The University at Buffalo requires all copy paper, janitorial paper, and other paper supplies to be composed of 100% post-consumer recycled content to the maximum extent possible.

Policy Statement

The University at Buffalo (UB, university) requires the use of 100% post-consumer, recycled content, process chlorine-free paper for all of its paper needs including copy paper, university documents and publications, janitorial paper, and other paper supplies, unless recycled paper is unavailable.

When paper with 100% post-consumer recycled content is not available or does not meet required form, function, or utility, or the cost of the product is not competitive, paper procurements shall use post-consumer recycled content to the extent practicable. Non-recycled content shall be derived from sustainably-managed renewable resources to the extent practicable.

The university is committed to responsible stewardship of natural resources and strives to:
reduce the university’s carbon footprint and environmental impact on forests, air, water, and energy resources
reduce fossil fuel usage
conserve natural resources
demonstrate UB leadership in campus environmental sustainability
encourage faculty, staff, and students to be environmentally conscious
support the consumer market for environmentally responsible products.

Background


On April 24, 2008, Governor Paterson issued Executive Order #4 that states in part, that commencing no later than July 1, 2008:
all copy paper, janitorial paper and other paper supplies purchased by each state agency or authority shall be composed of 100% post consumer recycled content to the maximum extent practicable, and all copy and janitorial paper shall be process chlorine-free to the extent practicable, unless such products do not meet required form, function or utility, or the cost of the product is not competitive.  All state agency and authority publications shall be printed on 100% post-consumer recycled content paper. Where paper with 100% post-consumer recycled content is not available, or does not meet required form, function and utility, paper procurements shall use post-consumer recycled content to the extent practicable. Non-recycled content shall be derived from a sustainably-managed renewable resource to the extent practicable, unless the cost of the product is not competitive.

Applicability

This policy applies to all university entities and employees.


Definitions

Carbon footprint
The measure of the impact human activities have on the environment in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.

Fossil Fuel
Fuels or hydrocarbons found within the top layer of the Earth’s crust. Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form, and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being formed.

Process Chlorine-Free Paper
Paper that is not bleached with chlorine or chlorine derivatives, avoiding dioxin pollution and other negative environmental impacts.

Sustainably-Managed Renewable Resource
A natural resource qualifies as a renewable resource if it is replenished by natural processes at a rate comparable or faster than its rate of consumption by humans or other users. Some natural renewable resources such as geothermal, fresh water, timber, and biomass must be carefully managed to avoid exceeding the environment's capacity to replenish them. Sustainable management of these resources meets the needs of the present without compromising the social, economic, and ecological needs of future generations.

Responsibility

All University Employees

Print and publish all university documents on 100% post-consumer recycled content, process chlorine-free, paper to the maximum extent possible.
Give preference to vendors who can provide or are able to secure 100% post-consumer process chlorine-free paper for printing services performed out-of-house (e.g., brochures, posters, invitations, self-mailers).

· Purpose
· The purpose of this policy is to support campus sustainability at the
University of Florida and to provide guidelines, information, and
resources in procuring products that will minimize negative impacts on
society and the environment to the greatest extent practicable.
· Responsibilities of Departments
· Develop and maintain information about environmentally and socially
preferable products. Departments should use the list composed in this
document as a guideline and may add or modify the list as needed.
· Inform employees of their responsibilities under this policy; provide
them with information about sustainable procurement opportunities.
Check the Purchasing web page for frequent updates on vendor
commitments to sustainability, including new annual contracts and
participation in vendor shows.
· Submit new ideas, problems or concerns to Purchasing (352) 392-1331
or e-mail purchasing@ufl.edu.
· Best Practices and Procurement Strategies
· Reduce waste at the point of purchase.
Faculty, staff and students can help achieve the university's waste
reduction goals by practicing the three R's: reducing, reusing, and
recycling. Priority should be given to reducing waste upstream by
purchasing products made from recycled material that can be reused or
recycled.
• Office paper, letterhead stationery, envelopes, and business cards
made from recycled paper
• Office supplies
• Recycled, remanufactured, or re-filled toner cartridges
• Furniture made with a percentage of postconsumer or postindustrial
material and/or FSC 50% certified wood
To reduce disposal costs and waste, choose items that can be
remanufactured, recycled, or composted. Many products made from
recycled materials are available and are being included in the University
of Florida contracts.
Contract information is available from the Purchasing website under
contracts and UF Pricing.
· Purchase durable and reusable goods.
Using life-cycle cost analysis, rather than automatically choosing goods
with the lowest purchase price, can help departments identify the best
long-term value. Factor in a product's estimated life span as well as its
energy, maintenance, consumable supplies and disposal costs.
• Consider durability and reparability of products prior to purchase.
• Invest in goods with extended warranties. Conduct routine
maintenance on products/equipment.
• Save money and minimize waste by eliminating single-use items,
such as non rechargeable batteries, in favor of rechargeable batteries.
Use rechargeable cartridges.
· Lease and rent when appropriate.
Consider an operating lease or rental rather than a purchase or capital
lease. Lease and rental contracts give vendors the responsibility for the
upkeep of goods such as computers and copiers, and for managing
them at the end of their useful life. Businesses that lease equipment
tend to manufacture more durable items, salvage reusable parts,
refurbish, recycle, or donate used equipment that can no longer be
leased. Renting is a cost-effective option for short-term equipment
needs.
· Specify product and packaging take-back.
• Increasingly, product vendors are offering to take back the products
they sell when they become obsolete. By utilizing vendors who offer an
Extended Product Responsibility (EPR) program, especially take-back,
recycle, and disposal programs, departments are ensured equipment
and products are disposed of properly whether recycled, donated,
refurbished or disposed of without the added cost.
• Other vendors will take back used items, such as carpeting and
toner cartridges, when purchasers buy new products. For example,
several carpet manufacturers have invested in sophisticated recycling
facilities that turn old carpet into new carpet or other goods and toner
cartridges are disposed of properly or sent to be recharged and sold at
a lower cost.
• Departments should require vendors to assume responsibility for
some of their shipping materials, such as wooden pallets and excess
packaging materials. When ordering large furniture or computer
shipments request products ship blanket-wrapped or using reduced
packing material.
· Buy goods in bulk or concentrated form.
This practice can significantly reduce the packaging associated with
lower product quantities and save costs. Carefully estimate demand
when purchasing in bulk; purchasing more than is needed can create
excess that becomes waste.
· Manage surplus effectively.
The University of Florida can reduce waste by eliminating excess
purchases. Reviewing past needs can minimize the procurement of
unneeded items. Clean out your office supply cabinet and post reusable
items for UF Departments on GatorList.net or donate to local
non-profit organizations such as Alachua County's Tools for Schools.
Departments should utilize Asset Management Services for disposing of
unwanted, out-dated property. Asset Management will effectively
redistribute, recycle, or dispose of surplus property by bidding it out
over the Internet through surplus on-line bids, police auctions, property
warehouse, or federal warehouse. For more information see Asset
Management Services Web Site: http://fa.ufl.edu/am/surplus/.
· Procure commodities that are certified to meet sustainability
standards.
Paper and Forest Products:
• Forest Stewardship Council - www.fsc.org
• Chlorine Free Products Association - www.chlorinefreeproducts.org
Electronics and Appliances:
• Energy Star - www.energystar.gov/purchasing
• Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) -
www.epeat.net
EPEAT has tiers of environmental performance. UF's bundled
computers will meet at least the EPEAT silver standard. UF's preference
is that when the certification is available on the products being
purchased, all purchases of computers and monitors meet or exceed
the silver EPEAT certification.

Food:
• USDA Organic, Food Alliance Certified, Ranforest Alliance Certified,

Council's Blue Eco-Label
· Procure remanufactured goods and use refurbishing services.
It is generally much less expensive to buy remanufactured goods such
as remanufactured toner cartridges, or to use refurbishing services for
computer upgrades, carpet repair, and furniture reupholster, than to
buy new items. ""Recharged"" toner cartridges typically save
departments 30 to 50 percent per sheet of paper. Remanufactured
items should require no sacrifice in performance. Check with
Purchasing for current contracts in place for remanufactured products.
· Purchase goods containing fewer toxic constituents.
By procuring goods with fewer or no toxic chemicals, departments can
reduce their hazardous waste disposal, future liability concerns, and the
risk of occupational exposure and spills. Low-toxicity products such as
mercury-free medical supplies, low mercury light bulbs/lamps with a
content of 90 picograms per lumen-hour or less, printing ink low in
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and chrome and chlorine free
cleaning supplies are increasingly available and cost-competitive. See
the Cross-sector certifications to help selecting products. The University
prefers all cleaning products purchased are either Green Seal or
EcoLogo certified.
· Reduce paper use.
• Set all printers, copiers, and fax machines to the default duplex
mode if the function is available.
• Purchase office equipment that has duplex capability.
• Purchase paper with recycled content
• Utilize technology to send and store information electronically.
• Utilize internet fax when available.
• E-mail document files instead of faxing hardcopies.
• Instead of having forms preprinted and stored, fill out forms online
and print as needed when available and feasible.
• Store documents electronically instead of storing hard copies.
· Current Guidelines in Place
· All University of Florida personnel will purchase recycled and
environmentally preferable products whenever practicable.
· University of Florida Departments will purchase hybrid or alternative
fuel vehicles.
· The University of Florida will have a recycle container available within a
reasonable distance of soda machines and in all dining establishments
where canned or bottled drinks are served:
http://www.ppd.ufl.edu/grndrr.htm. Contact Physical Plant's Solid
Waste Coordinator at 392-7396 or 392-1148 x 301.
· University of Florida should promote the use of recycled and other
environmentally preferable products by publicizing its sustainable
procurement program. Materials produced for advertising,
conferences, trade fairs, press releases, and other communications with
clients and citizens can make reference to the University of Florida's
commitment and leadership in the use of recycled and
environmentally/socially preferable products.
· The University Purchasing and Disbursements Department will make
every effort to secure contracts with vendors that are socially and
environmentally conscientious, and certified green whenever
practicable.
· Purchasing and UF's Zero Waste by 2015 Goal
· Purchasing recyclable or products made out of recycled material is only
part of the life cycle, you must recycle whenever possible. If you are not
sure about the different recycling programs on campus, visit the
Physical Plant Division, Grounds Department website
http://www.ppd.ufl.edu/grounds-refuse.html or call (352) 392-7396.

· Socially Responsible/Ethical Purchasing Standards
· In demonstrating a commitment to sustainability and seeking to ensure
safe and healthy workplaces for the people who make products for the
University of Florida, purchasers should strive to ensure that the
products they purchase meet International Labor Organization (ILO)
manufacturing standards and Fair Trade Labeling standards.

· Glossary
· Environmentally Preferable Products are products that have a lesser
impact on human health and the environment when compared with
competing products. This comparison may consider raw materials
acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, reuse,
operation, maintenance, or disposal of the product.
· Green Purchasing means purchasers take into consideration the
environmental impact of products when making purchasing decisions,
giving preference to more environmentally friendly products when
quality and price are equal or superior.
· Recycled Products are products manufactured with waste material that
has been recovered or diverted from solid waste. Recycled material
may be derived from post-consumer waste (material that has served its
intended end-use and been discarded by a final consumer), industrial
scrap, manufacturing waste, or other waste that would otherwise have
been wasted.
· Sustainability means meeting today's needs without compromising the
ability of future generations to satisfy their needs.
· Waste Prevention means any action undertaken by an individual or
organization to eliminate or reduce the amount or toxicity of materials
before they enter the municipal solid waste stream. This action is
intended to conserve resources, promote efficiency, and reduce
pollution.
· Reuse means repairing what is broken or giving it to someone who can
repair it or use it in its current state.
· Reduce means using less of products and utilizing other means of doing
business when available to reduce the amount and toxicity of trash
discarded.
· Recycle means to reprocess and reuse used material.
· Life Cycle Evaluation is an evaluation of the major environmental
impacts in each life-cycle stage of a product category including resource
extraction, production, distribution, use, and eventual disposal or
recycling. The evaluation considers energy, resource use, and emissions
to air, water, and land, as well as other environmental and health
impacts. The purpose of this evaluation is to identify significant lifecycle
stages to be addressed.
· Life Cycle Cost Analysis is an economic evaluation technique that
determines the total cost of owning and operating a building or
equipment.
· Rechargeable means to replenish the amount of electric power in
something, especially a battery.
· Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is vendors taking on the
responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products through
the entire product's life cycle; especially the take-back, recycle, and
disposal programs.
· Leasing is a legal rental contract allowing somebody exclusive
possession of another's property for a specific time in return for a
payment.
· Certification an official document or seal providing evidence and details
of something that is authentic and verified by a third party.
· Exemptions
· Nothing in this directive should be construed as requiring the purchase
of products that do not perform adequately or are not available at a
reasonable price.","UF has a Sustainable Purchasing directive encouraging the purchase of recycled content products and environmentally preferable paper, but the majority of purchases are decentralized and cannot be tracked.

Print Services

The ""State Agency Printing"" section (30 ILCS 500/20-105) of the Illinois Procurement Code states that all books, pamphlets, documents, and reports published by a State agency must contain the following information:

    ""Printed by the Authority of the State of Illinois.""
    Date of each publication.
    Number of copies printed.
    Printing order number.

Public universities are exempt from the above requirements if any of the following conditions are met:

    The printing service is not paid for with State funds.
    The printing service is fulfilled using ""on-campus"" printing services.
    The printing service is performed on behalf of another state governmental body.

Departments are responsible for determining if printing requests fall under one of the exemptions listed above. If a printing request does not meet one of the exemptions, department must ensure the printed material contains the information required by the Illinois Procurement Code as listed above. Additional requirements and considerations that pertain to any printing done by the University are as follows: The ""Soybean-oil based ink"" section (30 ILCS 500/45-15) of the Illinois Procurement Code mandates that the procurement of printing services must specify the use of soybean oil-based ink. The Chief Procurement Office for Higher Education may waive this requirement if he or she determines that another type of ink is required to assure high quality and reasonable pricing of the printed product. This requirement applies to both on and off-campus printing services.

If off-campus, a signed vendor certification letter, which certifies the vendor is in compliance with the ""Prevailing Wage Requirements"" section (30 ILCS 500/25-60) of the Illinois Procurement Code, must be obtained. Printing trade customs allow for plus or minus 10% in over/under runs. The University has standards for certain stationery materials including items with logos, items with the University Seal, and business cards. If using off-campus sources for printing these materials, departments must obtain written confirmation from the appropriate campus or University Administration office to ensure that the proposed materials conform to those standards prior to making the purchase.

Departments must purchase stationery and other printed products with recycled material content whenever cost, specifications, standards, and availability are comparable to products without recycled content.

At UIC, departments are encouraged to use paper with at least 10% post consumer content. For additional information, contact the Office of Publications.","UIC follows the statutes for procurement of recycled materials under the Illinois Procurement Code as follows:

a.	Recycled Materials (30 ILCS 500/45-20)
When a public contract is to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, an otherwise qualified bidder who will fulfill the contract through the use of products made of recycled materials may, on a pilot basis or in accordance with a pilot study, be given preference over other bidders unable to do so, provided that the cost included in the bid of the products made of  recycled materials is not more than 10% greater than the cost of products not made of recycled materials (Source: P.A. 90-572, eff. date See Sec 99-5.)

b.	Recyclable paper (30  ILCS 500/45-25)
All paper purchased for use by State agencies must be recyclable paper unless recyclable paper cannot be used to meet the requirements of the State agencies.  State agencies shall determine their paper requirements to allow the use of recyclable paper whenever possible, including without limitation using plain paper rather than colored paper that is not recyclable.

UNL Procurement Services pursues the promotion, development and procurement of environmentally preferred goods and services whenever possible.  Procurement Services will work with departments, employees, contractors and vendors alike to seek out and provide resources and information that will enable our customers to make informed purchasing decisions, while promoting environmental stewardship. 

UNL Procurement  Services is committed to buying more environmentally preferable  goods and services as long as they meet our performance needs and they are  available within a reasonable period of time at a reasonable cost. By including environmental   considerations in our procurement decisions, along with our traditional concerns with price, performance and availability, we will remain fiscally responsible while promoting products and services that have a reduced effect on human health and the environment. 

UNL’s “Green Purchasing” strategy is to develop policies consistent with the following: 
1.Minimize the consumption of natural resources by reviewing current and proposed future usage and evaluating the pros and cons of alternatives. 
2.Seek alternatives to products and processes that are detrimental to the environment  by using more “environmentally friendly” products and processes.

USNH Purchasing also directs vendors to direct p-card users to buy 90-100% recycled options. UNH promotes buying preferable paper and these types of practices are discussed when staff are issued UNH credit cards, called p-cards (purchasing cards), along with other ethical policies that are involved.

","In 2001, the UNH Recyled Paper Initiative began increasing the recycled content of paper used by the UNH community to a percentage higher than the old UNH, and State of New Hampshire, standard of 30% post consumer. Members of the UNH Recycled Paper Initiative - including representatives from the UNH Student Senate, the UNH Student Environmental Action Coalition, UNH Printing Services, USNH Purchasing Office, UNH Central Receiving, and the Sustainability Institute - issued a Recycled Paper Initiative Report and Recommendations. Until 2006, UNH required all offices and department to purchasing 100% post consumer paper through UNH Central Receiving, saving energy, trees and landfill space. As many more 100% post consumer paper products become more prevalent in today's market, the UNH community now purchases recycled paper through its outside office supply contracted vendors. In 2007, paper purchases were decentralized and the USNH Purchasing Office conducted a formal Request for Bid process to establish a five-year vendor contract specifically to provide users with 100% recycled copy paper.  The contract was rebid in 2012.  Approximately 89% of the copy paper now purchased by UNH is recycled.

In 2011, UNH’s printing and copying habits were assessed and a PrintSmart initiative begun. During the first year of PrintSmart, the university saved more than $475,000. PrintSmart was developed as an effort to consolidate all copy, scan and fax needs into one multi-functional device (MFD) managed by one company. Conway Office Products was the partner UNH chose, and they proposed Xerox devices as the MFD. Through leveraging all of the campus copy volumes, the process greatly reduced the cost-per-copy for the entire campus. Other cost reduction strategies included having devices default to print double-sided copies, and copying in black and white rather than color. The MFDs are networked so that multiple offices can print to one device, eliminating the need for multiple desk-jet and laser printers, resulting in less expensive per-copy costs. What’s more, the new Energy-Star rated Xerox MFDs are more efficient than their predecessors. The savings are a combination of reductions in cost-per-copy, reduced energy use, and the purchase of paper and desk-jet and laser cartridges. The total savings for 2012 ($475,328) is almost double the initial estimates, and represents about a 36 percent savings over 2011.

The University’s goal is to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of its paper and paper products purchases with recycled content, effective June 30, 1997. Accordingly, Buy-Recycled purchases will occur where it is found economically practicable and cost effective to do so. ”Recycled content” products are those which incorporate waste materials and by-products that have been recovered or diverted from the solid waste stream, but does not include those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process. The purchase of recycled content products fosters the growth of the availability of this type product and the closure of the cost variance between recycled content and ‘virgin’ products. The following actions will continuously be taken to further foster this program and meet the program objectives:

- All campus departments are to purchase and use products manufactured from or containing recycled materials whenever feasible. In particular, recycled content paper and paper products should be used.

- Requirements’ specifications will be continuously reviewed and revised, as appropriate, to eliminate any discrimination against materials and supplies with recycled content, except where health, safety and welfare would be placed in jeopardy.

- Solicitation documents will be written so as to encourage vendors and contractors to offer products having recycled content and to propose prices for such products. Pricing obtained by the campus will similarly conform. Recycled product proposals will be considered in the evaluation for award, and, where the product is comparable in quality, availability and price,

- Where available, consideration will be given to products which are reusable, refillable, repairable, more durable, less toxic, and use minimal packaging. State term contracts will be used, as well, where recycled content products are listed.

- Public documents published for the University printed on recycled paper will contain a printed statement or symbol indicating that the document was printed on recycled paper.

- Purchases of recycled content paper and paper products are to be reported to the Purchasing Department to support State mandated annual reporting requirements.

- Announcements and correspondence will be made to emphasize the significance of the Buy-Recycled program, where and when appropriate.

The Purchasing Department will serve as the administrator and coordinator of this “Buy-Recycled” program.","Promotion and awareness via the Sustainability Office website, the Green Office Program, and other sustainability outreach efforts.

EPP is the procurement of goods and services that have a reduced impact on human health and the environment compared to competing products serving the same purpose. It is an essential part of our search for high quality products and services at competitive prices. A major contributor is the annual Sustainability and Diversity Show that showcases the sustainable efforts and products of key suppliers.

The university encourages departments to select from environmentally preferred options.  The PantherExpress website (http://cfo.pitt.edu/pexpress/index.php) provides tips and resources for departmental managers to guide them through the procurement process. Procurement of office paper is handled by the cost centers requiring the materials. Each division has the opportunity to review, test, and implement their own preference of products through the University's Approved Vendor listing. These vendors are instructed to recommend environmentally responsible products as part of their product listings. Additionally, as new products are developed, the vendors are instructed to raise awareness through continuing discussion and education.  ","Efforts to increase Sustainable Purchasing of green products at the University of Pittsburgh are ongoing. For office paper, overall spend has continued to decrease and has contributed to less printing overall as well as increased duplex or double-sided printing which fosters sustainable practices. However, the overall paper purchases within the sustainability solution (includes recycled and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Certified) accounted for 36% of total spend in FY15. 
Raising awareness on the sustainable aspects of using remanufactured toner/inkjet cartridges continues. The percentage of ink cartridges with recycled content increased from 9% in FY13 to 14% in FY14 to 24.3% in FY15. 
Another University supplier contributing to Sustainable Purchasing efforts is Workscape Furniture.  During fiscal year 2015, because the University purchased modular walls: 213 VOCs were saved - 4,655 lbs. of drywall was diverted from landfills and 75 tons of waste over the product life was diverted from landfills. Also, Steelcase Furniture products was a potential contribution to LEED projects.

Exceptions should be documented and filed as they happen, unless other arrangements need to be made for vendors and high-volume purchasers.

Sample text from RFP: 
5.5	Environmental Sustainability Programs

5.5.1	Vanderbilt is committed to implementing environmentally sustainable programs including the purchase of “green” products whenever possible. The details of our university-wide initiative are available at: http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/

5.2.1	Please provide details on any current green initiatives you may have with other large customers that you would propose implementing at Vanderbilt. What tools or processes do you have at your disposal to help us identify opportunities to promote environmental sustainability?

Yes - In 2012, Vanderbilt awarded an office paper contract to American Paper and Twine that specifies a preference for paper with at least 30% recycled content.   During the RFP process, all vendors were assessed according to the following criteria: environmentally responsible practices including sourcing and transportation practices, the use of post-consumer content and cradle-to cradle product design and production.  Vanderbilt’s Sustainability Director is involved in reviewing vendor proposals and choosing vendors for major contracts, such as office paper, office supplies, janitorial supplies, solid waste management, etc.  Vanderbilt’s Procurement program offers numerous environmentally friendly products and product lines, which are designated as such to Procurement users.  
Vanderbilt Printing Services focuses their sustainability efforts on the following:
•	Recycling- Since 1989, we have been recycling nearly all of the waste generated in our production facility. In 2009 alone, our paper recycling efforts saved 1,781 trees by reprocessing our recycled materials.
•	Standard Products- All official Vanderbilt University and Medical Center business cards and letterhead are printed on a recycled stock or paper made from renewable sources.
•	Ink- The inks we use are formulated and manufactured to be environmentally responsible and incorporate the use of renewable resources of vegetable oils (soy oil included).
•	Energy Efficiency- In our Campus Copy operations, all digital output devices meet or exceed US Energy Star requirements.  These printers use less energy, save money for the university, and help protect the environment.
•	Paper- We are proud to work with manufacturers who have strong economic, environmental, and social commitments.  Whenever possible, Vanderbilt Printing purchases paper from vendors with either Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) Chain-of-Custody (CoC) certifications. Vanderbilt Printing Services stocks and encourages the use of recycled paper from such vendors.
•	Toner Recycling - Guy Brown, Vanderbilt’s partner for ink and toner cartridge recycling, had a record-setting year in 2015. The overall number of cartridges recycled, the recovery rate of cartridges, and donations made from recycling proceeds were at all-time highs in 2015, resulting in the donation of $6,000 each to the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt, the Susan Gray School, and the Work/Life Connections–EAP  Faculty and Staff Hardship Fund from recycling these items. Vanderbilt staff recycled more than 13,700 cartridges, with a 63 percent recovery rate—almost double that of 2014.
•	SmartPrint Program – In 2015, Vanderbilt University Printing Services initiated the SmartPrint program. Every department is charged a per page fee for every color print they make. In 2016, changes will expand to include black and white prints. Students have been charged for every page they print for multiple years. This new initiative will have a direct impact on Vanderbilt University’s office paper purchases.

Individual departments are responsible for purchasing their own paper products. However, Vanderbilt University strongly encourages students and employees to purchase paper products with at least 30% postconsumer recycled content through our primary office paper supply vendor. FSC certified paper is also available for purchase through American Paper and Twine as well as VU Printing Services. Many large university printing efforts are now printed on FSC-certified paper with post-consumer recycled content and vegetable-based inks.  All standard business cards and letterhead ordered through Vanderbilt University’s Printing Services are printed on recycled stock. A green printing guidance document that advises Vanderbilt community members on green printing options such as paper that is FSC-certified, contains recycled-content, or is processed chlorine-free was developed in 2009-2010 by the Sustainability and Environmental Management Office, VU Printing Services, and VU Creative Services.

In addition to bearing the FSC label, each certified publication indicates the amount of recycled content it contains and marks the piece as recyclable. VUPS can now provide FSC-certified printed matter to any customer desiring their order to carry the well-known and respected certification mark. In addition to the FSC mark, customers are also offered the option to add the Rainforest Alliance mark to their FSC-certified jobs

The College should demonstrate that the social and environmental Commitment evidenced in its Mission Statement and its Environmental Commitment Statement are carried out in its purchasing policies. This portion of the Pattern Language document builds upon those commitments and provides a guide for responsible purchasing of goods and services. Purchasing decisions are made by many individuals, all of whom must take into account the impact on the environment as well as the economic impact when making buying choices. The purchasers should have an understanding of the advantages of environmentally friendly and socially sound purchasing practices. Socially and environmentally conscious purchasing practices take research and reflection, so it is also necessary to encourage purchasers to seek new and better materials and business relationships. Bringing the impact on the environment into purchasing decisions must become an attitude used by all those making these decisions.

The College is interested in buying materials that promote the health and sustainability of our biosphere. When making purchasing decisions the following principles should be incorporated:

Reuse existing materials
Purchase recycled or remanufactured materials that have lower impact on the environment in their production, packaging, use, and, ultimately, their disposal than new materials
Purchase locally provided materials and services where available, with preference given to locally owned and operated businesses
Purchase long lived products made from renewable resources
Avoid toxic materials where choices are available, e.g.; inks, paints high in volatile compounds, carpets high in noxious odors and chemicals, cleaning solutions containing hazardous or environmentally harmful components
It is College policy that ENERGY STAR products will be purchased wherever the choice exists.
Preference should be given to resource-efficient products, i.e., products that use the least or conserve the most energy, water, gas, and other nonrenewable or environmentally costly resources.

Gifts and donations should be subject to the same standards as purchased products.

Warren Wilson College understands the impact of doing business with companies with socially unethical business practices. Therefore, Warren Wilson College will seek to avoid purchasing from companies that have a history of discrimination based upon race, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion or physical handicap or who have demonstrated unfair labor practices. Warren Wilson College will also seek to avoid purchases with companies that use child labor or do not provide a living wage.
