The next week, a link to an online survey containing the same questions was emailed to 300 randomly selected employee email addresses; 157 (52%) replied during a 3-day period, none of whom overlapped the phone sample. Total sample (phone + online) = 239 employees. The gender (F=62%) and job category distributions (30% administrators, 28% faculty, 41% staff) of respondents were a good match to the population of employees who have individual phone extensions and/or email addresses.

Only 37/239 = 15.5% of respondents had NOT driven a motor vehicle to work in the past 5 days, and biked, walked, or both to work; none of these reported using public transportation. 

Of the 202/239=84.5% who drove to work in the past 5 days, only 13 (6.4%) shared a ride with at least one other person. Of this small number, fewer than half rideshared all 5 days. None of those in the samples reported commuting via motorcycle, scooter, etc.

Usable vehicle make/model/year info was obtained from 195 of the 202 driving commuters and the corresponding MPG and CO2 was calculated using EPA vehicle averages. The mean MPG of the vehicles was 22.6 (sd=6.98), median = 21 MPG.  The mean annual CO2 emission for the vehicles was 6.9 US tons (sd=1.62), with a median of 7 tons. 

In November 2013, another commuting survey was conducted.  A solicitation and survey link was sent to 400 randomly chosen faculty and staff (FAS) email addresses. There were 188 respondents (47% response rate; 64% F), almost equally divided among administrators, faculty, and staff. Staff outnumber both Administrators and Faculty in the college employee population, so the sample under-represented Staff members.

185 respondents said they actually had been to campus during the preceding five working days. They replied to this multi-item checklist of methods for getting to work, as shown below:
In the past five working days, how did you commute from home to Dickinson? Choose all that apply: 
•	I biked. 
•	I drove my personal vehicle, with no other passengers 
•	I drove my personal vehicle, with at least one other passengers. 
•	I rode a bus. 
•	I rode with a Dickinson employee 
•	I rode with someone who is not a Dickinson employee 
•	I walked. 
•	Other (please specify): (8) ____________________


Respondents were allowed to check more than one method of commuting. Nonetheless, over half (n=100; 54%) chose only the response, I drove my personal vehicle with no other passengers. A substantial minority (n=69; 37%) reported having bicycled, taken a bus, or walked to work at least once during the previous five working days; many of these had also driven at least once. Ridesharing -- either as driver or passenger -- was rare; only 26 employees  (14%) checked any of the ridesharing options.

Because Emory’s Transportation & Parking Office did not have access to exact figures for some of these categories, the following methodology was used in our calculations:
The drive alone category simply includes any employee who purchased a parking permit (46%), while the van/carpool includes all employees registered as such (4%). The non-motorized category includes employees registered as walkers/bikers and the Occasional Use parkers (1%) who, according to the Transportation & Parking office, tend to be employees that drive in inclement weather, but walk/bike as their primary mode of transportation. The public transportation category includes employees registered for Park & Ride or MARTA passes, and we made the assumption that the remaining unaccounted for employees use some form of public transportation.

UC San Diego can best ensure accuracy by reporting metrics currently tracked by Transportation Services, which meticulously documents the total number of commuters during its annual survey of pedestrian and vehicle traffic.
This survey focuses on tracking all commuter data for transportation and greenhouse gas purposes, but it does not distinguish between student, faculty, staff or campus visitors. Over a decade of data has been collected in this manner and demonstrates a significant increase in alternative transportation usage by commuters.

These results indicate the primary mode of travel to and from campus, and do not include multi-modal trips or people who use different modes throughout the week (such as someone who usually drives, but takes the bus sometimes). 

Our total population of employees and students at the main campus is 40,894. 2,679 people* (7%) responded to the MMTC survey. This sample size provides us a 95% confidence level** and a 2% margin of error***. The confidence level and margin of error were calculated using SurveyMonkey's Sample Size Calculator: https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/ 

The University receives total transit trip data from Port Authority of Allegheny County, but at this time cannot distinguish between student and employee travel. We hope that future technology advancements will allow us to distinguish between employee and student ridership counts. 

According to MMTC, the mode split for the University of Pittsburgh main campus is as follows:
Drive Alone: 38.6%
Carpool: 4.8%
Vanpool: 0.9%
Dropped off: 2.6%
Bus: 34.3%
Light Rail: 2.3%
Park and Ride: 3.0%
University Shuttle: 0.7%
Bike: 5.1%
Walk: 7.2%
Telecommute: 0.2%
Other: 0.3%

For the purposes of this reporting, the following adjustments were made to the MMTC category results:
- The ""Take a campus shuttle or public transportation"" category also includes people who use Park and Rides, accounting for approximately 3% of our total campus population.
- The ""Vanpool or carpool"" category also includes people that reported being dropped off at work, approximately 2.6% of our total campus population.
- Our permit records indicate about 2% of our total employee population commutes to campus using a motorcycle, scooter, or moped. Since individuals using these types of vehicles would also most likely be driving alone, we removed 2% from the ""drive alone"" category (originally 39%) to avoid double counting.

The regional MMTC survey results can be found at: http://www.makemytripcount.org/
Main campus population numbers are reported as recorded in the University's 2016 Fact Book: http://www.ir.pitt.edu/factbook/documents/FactBook2016.pdf 

   * MMTC results can not distinguish between student and employee responses.
  ** Confidence Level: The probability that our survey sample accurately reflects the behaviors of the entire population.
 *** Margin of Error: The range, measured as a percentage, that the total population's behaviors might deviate from our sample responses.

Public Transportation: The percentage indicated is based on the number of Metro Passes requested/distributed to employees.  Although we have no system in place as of yet to determine how many of these passes are relied upon as a primary means of transport, we assume that they are used on a frequent basis and know that many do rely on St. Louis Metro for their daily commuting needs between campuses and around the city.

Drive alone: The percentage indicated is based on the number of Parking Passes requested/distributed.

In 2015, commuters travel an average of approximately 12 miles (with the range of commutes spanning 0-216 miles each way).  During 2008 (the last year for which we have commuting emissions data), faculty/staff commuting accounted for about 8% of college transportation-related emissions.  We collected commuting data from over 500 participants that allows us to assess the average number of days that people commute to campus, the average distance traveled, and mode(s) of transportation used and the likelihood of carpooling. Of those 500 responses, roughly 60% were staff and 38% were faculty (the remaining 2% classified themselves as “other”). 

Our survey indicates that over 80% of faculty/staff drive to work by themselves. Commuters travel an average of 12 miles (one way) to get to work at Wellesley. Most employees (63.3%) commute to work 5+ days/week, with 21.4% commuting 4 days/week, 11% commuting 3 days per week and less than 4% commuting less than 2 days per week.  
Of the employees who drive themselves to work, approximately 16% said they would consider carpooling and about 15% said they would probably consider carpooling.  About half (49%) said probably not and about 19% indicated they would not carpool (mostly due to erratic schedules and shuttling their children back and forth).",http://cs.wellesley.edu/~slee/sust/,"Information on telecommuting is not available.

So data about home address is likely out of date for many. 

We used more reliable reports about employees using the campus shuttle between the Wells campus and Ithaca - currently 5 employees regularly use this service. 

A number of Wells College employees live in adjacent College housing, so they feasibly have the option to walk or bike. A number of those responses were capture in the survey data below. 

In February 2016, we sent all employees a survey requesting more detailed information about their commute (how often per week, how far, as well as asking for the % breakdown of transportation modes listed above). We received a 30% response rate, which we consider representative of our campus community, as all employee categories were reflected.  

Of 52 respondents to the question requesting the primary mode of transportation (50% or higher), 85% primarily drove alone; 9% walked to work; 10% reported carpooling; 2% used the campus shuttle. None reported using motorcycles or other small 2-wheel vehicles or telecommuting more than 50% of the time.
