During the Annual Sustainability Research Forum, several projects where highlighted for their innovation, success, and/or interdisciplinary scope. Some of the research abstracts are included below:

Dr. Beth Ellington - My research involves utilizing Engstrom’s Activity Models to analyze the planting, harvesting, transporting and ginning processes of Cotton of the Carolinas “dirt to shirt” supply chain to identify areas for improvement in the information flows, material flows and financial flows in order to make it leaner and greener. Cotton of the Carolinas, http://whereyourclothing.com/, is an organization that makes “homegrown” t-shirts from NC grown cotton. Their “dirt to shirt” supply chain concept is focused on a transparent green supply chain where their t-shirts travel on average 750 miles from “dirt to shirt” thus minimizing the environmental impact of producing the shirts. My research is focused on environmental, economic and social equity issues involved in outsourcing and how Cotton of the Carolinas is trying to reverse its impact on the NC farming and textile industries.

Tom Hansell - The social, economic, and environmental challenges to Wales and Appalachia in recent decades are at times tragically similar: increasing unemployment, chronic health problems, environmental devastation, and the challenge of redefining community identity. The Welsh coalfields were shut down in the 1980’s, with a loss of more than 20,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the Appalachian coalfields lost 23,000 mining jobs between 1980 and 2000, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts Central Appalachian coal production will be cut in half this decade. Stories from miners, mothers, and other coalfield  residents offer rare insight into the transition away from fossil fuels. The goal of the After Coal project is to facilitate conversations about sustainable development in coalfield communities through a combination of live forums, local radio programming, and public television broadcast. Our work is built on the following principles:
• Local people must control the development of their own communities.
• Cultural democracy is an essential ingredient for building sustainable and
democratic economies in the coalfields.
• Exchanging information across global mountain regions can help
communityies create localized solutions to issues related to the extraction of natural resources.",--,--

ASU scientists, along with colleagues at Argonne National Laboratory, have reported advances toward perfecting a functional artificial leaf. Designing an artificial leaf that uses solar energy to convert water cheaply and efficiently into hydrogen and oxygen is one of the goals of BISfuel – the Energy Frontier Research Center, funded by the Department of Energy, in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State University.

Dragica Vasileska, a professor in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, will lead a national project aimed at producing more reliable and durable photovoltaic cells for solar energy systems.

In new research conducted at ASU’s Biodesign Institute, scientists explore the relationships of two important bacterial forms, demonstrating their ability to produce electricity by coordinating their metabolic activities.

Salt River Project and ASU's College of Technology and Innovation have partnered for a second year to award a $170,000 grant to fund research initiatives in renewable energy and conservation.

Mikhail Chester, an assistant professor in the School of Sustainable Engineering has been involved in a variety of research efforts to accurately forecast the costs – both economically and environmentally – of transportation systems and technologies throughout their life cycles and over the coming decades.

A $180,000 grant was awarded to the College of Technology and Innovation at Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University (NAU) to support a study on ways to naturally eliminate invasive plants.

In a Co.EXIST article by Stan Alcorn, ASU researcher Kevin Gurney discusses his tool, the Ventus Project, an online portal that allows everyday citizens to record nearby carbon-emitting power plants.

Research to help provide more sustainable water and energy resources earns ASU chemical engineer Mary Laura Lind support from the National Science Foundation.

A transdisciplinary team of scientists is using the hot and populous Phoenix metropolitan area to explore how different segments of the region are being affected by increasingly oppressive heat.

The Mike Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business faculty routinely publish books and monographs on the sustainability of entertainment industries; its signature student applied research project, The Pipeline Program, connects teams of qualified entertainment and music business students, led by a faculty supervisor, with entertainment industries and together they develop solutions to a diverse range of industry problems.  Students' Pipeline Project research has been recognized and applied not only by local entertainment industries, but also by the U.S. Copyright Office.  The Pipeline Project 4.0, a music industry think-tank created by the Belmont University Mike Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business, was recently cited by the U.S. Copyright Office in a final report on copyright and music licensing policy, published Feb. 5.  The Pipeline team consisted of nine undergraduate Belmont students selected to consult with industry investors.

",Bentley must track and report faculty research as part of the EQUIS accreditation process.  The 2015 EQUIS accreditation team created a comprehensive list of faculty conducting sustainability research through a thorough review of faculty CVs. We have used that research to create our current list.,"Faculty from the Natural and Applied Sciences Dept. received an NSF grant related to integrating sustainability and science into the business curriculum.  The professors who applied for the grant have worked closely with professors in other departments (economics, global studies) to create several sustainability, economics and public policy courses that all use the same USDA data set on corn ethanol.  They created modules that cross interdisciplinary boundaries so that students are looking at issues with corn ethanol from many different angles including: chemistry, energy, public policy and economics. The goal of this exercise is to teach students that sustainability (and resource) challenges are multifaceted and cannot be solved by looking at the issue through one lens (only economics for example). The professors will seek another grant following this methodology using natural gas hydraulic fracturing data in which classes will study the science behind fracking"" the public health challenges, the economics costs and benefits, and the public policy debate.",http://www.bentley.edu/ideas,--

Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future as a Faculty Research Fellow in September 2014. The Pardee Center holds symposia and conducts research intended to contribute to the long-term well being of people around the world. Professor Anderson will work with Pardee Center Director Anthony Janetos to understand and evaluate the social and economic impacts of climate variations and develop models to assist in navigating through these impacts. This research will identify sectors and regions that are most vulnerable, as well as provide guidance on the development of proper planning and management policies for these areas. 

Professor Mark Grinstaff of the BU Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering was recently awarded an National Science Foundation Career grant titled ""Environmentally Friendly Microfiber Polycarbonate Meshes for Continuous Oil Retrieval” for 2014 - 2017 (est.). The Grinstaff Group will prepare and explore an environmentally friendly, biodegradable oil absorbing sponge for enhanced oil recovery after an oil spill.  To do so, they will synthesize different polymer-based materials and characterize them in terms of their mechanical and oil-absorbing properties and their biodegradability.

Research performed by Earth & Environment PhD candidate Conor Gately, Associate Professor Lucy Hutyra, and Associate Professor Ian Sue Wing published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in April 2015 was recently featured in the Scientific American. The research, titled ""“Cities, traffic, and CO2: A multidecadal assessment of trends, drivers, and scaling relationships” found that cities and their commuting population emit a large percentage of on-road CO2 emissions. Furthermore, a new emissions inventory was developed; the Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE) estimates CO2 emitted by US road transport at a resolution of 1 km annually for 1980–2012.

During the fall semester 2015, The Dean of Student Affairs office worked with the Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee to formalize a definition for sustainability in the curriculum. Once established, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs sent an e-mail to a selected group of faculty that the Environmental Studies Department and Sustainability Office had narrowed down as potential courses to include.  The Dean's e-mail asked the faculty to self-identify if they believed any of their courses fell under the categories of sustainability related or sustainability focused. They also asked faculty to self-identify if they thought their scholarly research projects or grants met the criterion for sustainability research. The list of faculty that had included their scholarly research projects or grants during the 2013 inventory were also reviewed and if still relevant, included on this list, along with new faculty members who identified their work as sustainability research during the Fall 2015 inquiry.",,--,--

A draft inventory was prepared and sent to each department for review for accuracy and completeness.,"http://www.clarkson.edu/green/get_involved/research_opportunities.html >

Green Data Center:  This multi-disciplinary program involving Profs. Pier Marzocca (Mech.Engrg.), Ajit Achuthan (Mech.Engrg.), Kerop Janoyan (Civil Engrg.), Jeanna Matthews (Comp. Sci.), Stephen Bird (Pol. Sci.), Martin Heintzelman (Econ.), Joseph Skufca (Math), and Lei Wu (Elec. Engrg.), combines engineering, public policy, and financial studies. It addresses several important energy policy, economic, and operational concerns related to a NYSERDA funded engineering project that develops the concept of ""Green Data Computing Centers."" It addresses challenges associated with both the migration to a cloud computing infrastructure, and the use of distributed and alternative electricity generation, with a specific focus on renewable energy sources.  The concept is to make use of a distributed network of data centers to make this high-energy-demand technology more energy-efficient and cost-effective than current methods. If successful and deployed on a larger scale, this project could bring significant energy savings to an industry that can consume one megawatt of electricity at times of peak operation.

Wetlands Restoration Ecology: Clarkson researchers are monitoring the effectiveness of public-private partnership programs for wetland restoration and conservation. Aspects of this research include assessment of wetland-associated biodiversity, water quality, and ecosystem services of restored wetlands on private agricultural land (Drs. T. A. Langen, M. Twiss; Bio.), landowner satisfaction and valuation of participation in wetland restoration programs (Dr. J.R. Welsh, Soc. Sci.)), and the impact of wetland restoration on private property values (Dr. M. Heintzelman, Econ.). The objective of this research is to help the National Resource Conservation Service, US Fish & Wildlife Service, and other conservation agencies be more affective at meeting wetland conservation objectives in agricultural landscapes.  

Woody Biofuels:  Prof. P.K. Hopke (Chem. Engrg.) A. Rossner (ISE) and T.M. Holsen (Env. Engrg.) have been studying advanced combustion systems for woody biomass for their thermal efficiency and emissions. Clarkson has installed a 150 kW high efficiency, low emissions boiler in the Walker Center to study wood pellet combustion.   This team has also conducted studies at the Wild Center in Tupper Lake, NY on their 500 kW boiler as well as measuring the emissions from the combustion of switch grass pellets in conjunction with SUNY –Canton.  The Walker Center boiler is being further modified to include thermal storage and innovative particle control systems to study system optimization and thereby minimize fuel input and emissions.

Energy Education: Efforts to promote energy literacy, which is a citizenship understanding of energy that includes broad content knowledge as well as affective and behavioral aspects, will move us toward a more sustainable energy future by empowering people to make objective energy-related decisions and actions throughout their daily life. With a deeper and broader understanding of energy, people are more likely to adopt behavioral changes that will effectively contribute toward energy conservation and efficiency, and are more likely to embrace technological changes in the way our society harnesses and consumes energy. The research efforts of Dr. J. DeWaters (Engrg.) and Prof. S. Powers (Inst. Sus. Env.) focus on improving our understanding of how energy education can improve energy literacy among pre-college students and young adults. Effective educational programs are important at any age, but are particularly valuable for pre-college (K-12) students, since energy-related awareness and values are largely formulated during childhood. To that end, a variety of educational modules have been developed to teach students about energy resources, energy systems, and environmental impacts. Recent efforts, with funding from NASA and additional expertise of Prof. S. Dhaniyala (Mech. Engrg.) enabled broadening the effort to include global climate change. The energy and climate modules are disseminated through teacher training workshops, which deepen their scientific content knowledge and provide them with materials, information, and a networked support system that enables them to deliver quality programming in their classrooms. Quantitative energy literacy and climate literacy questionnaires, also developed at Clarkson, have been used in a variety of applications to assess the status of energy and climate literacy and identify educational needs among pre-college and college age students. The instruments also provide a means to measure the broader impacts of educational programs, and in this way the research contributes toward creating and improving energy education programs that help improve students’ energy and climate literacy.

The Smart Housing Project includes faculty from all schools and 6 departments.  This project has several grants to increase the efficiency of campus apartment residences through building energy modeling and motivating behavior change. (Depts include Pol. Sci. Psych., ISE, CEE, ChE, ECE, math)

The microgrid project has several grants and is working closely with the Village and other area institutions on research and implementation of a microgrid for resilience during extreme weather events or other major disruptions.

These 173 faculty members are required to conduct research.  To complete the inventory of those people engaged in sustainability research, we went through that list of 173 faculty members with Russ Cole, the Oak Professor of Biological Sciences.							","For a summary of the sustainability research accomplishments by the faculty of the Environmental Studies department, visit the website below.  Here is one professor's accomplishments: Professor Denise Bruesewitz is interested in how human activities alter aquatic ecosystem function. Specifically, she studies nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon cycling in aquatic ecosystems with the goal of understanding how ecosystem function and ecosystem services change in response to human activities. Her ongoing projects include understanding how restored oyster reefs in New York City mitigate nutrient pollution, how lakes across the globe process carbon, and determining how rivers and estuaries in south Texas respond to drought and storms. At Colby, she will build upon ongoing research in the Belgrade Lakes, as well as local streams and rivers, with a focus on carbon and nutrient cycling in these aquatic systems.

- Keynote at the European Conference on Sustainability, Energy and the Environment
- Multiple presentations at the AshokaU social entrepreneurship exchange on teaching sustainable enterprise

Helen Hess is currently working with several COA students to develop a censusing protocol at Anemone Cave in Acadia National Park to monitor populations of three sea anemone species at the site. This research will inform Park decisions regarding mitigation of freshwater run-off into the tidepools, which may be increasing with changing weather patterns and may impose a physiological stress on the organisms. (Research permit #ACAD-2014-SCI-0023.)

Students in Anne Kozak's Spring 2014 course in Communicating Science wrote text for an exhibit on the effects of climate change in Acadia National Park. The exhibit, which is scheduled to open in 2016 for the 100th anniversary of Acadia, will be located in the Nature Center at Sieur de Monts Spring.

Students in Anne Kozak’s 2014 Technical Writing class wrote white papers on research park scientists are conducting on natural and cultural resources in Acadia; these white papers will be used by the interpretive staff to enhance the visitor experience.

Anne Kozak also wrote articles for a local newspaper about the emerald borer and the wooly adelgid, both of which potentially threaten trees in Acadia and on Mount Desert Island

An email was sent to all full-time faculty members, adjunct faculty and other teaching staff to request that they participate in the online survey. Responses were received from 107 of the 217 people to whom the request was sent for a response rate of 49%. Results of the survey were used to create this inventory of sustainability related scholarship at Dickinson. ","Global Climate Change Mosiac Interview Research: Fourteen Dickinson students, Earth Science Professor Jeff Niemitz, and CSE Director Neil Leary conducted research at the UN climate conference held in Lima, Peru in December 2014, interviewing delegates about the negotiations.

FARMDATA - A Mobile/Networked Database Application for the College Farm:
Two computer science students, with the assistance of Mathematics & Computer Science Professor Tim Wahls, created FARMDATA - a database of planting, harvesting, tillage, spraying, and invoicing records for the Dickinson College Farm. They also added a web interface that allows entry of all data and running of reports from any web-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, desktop machine, etc.). As part of this project, the students learned two programming languages (PHP, Javascript), two markup languages (HTML, CSS), and a database query language (SQL).

Painted Turtle Nest Site Selection: For the last five years, Dickinson students have conducted field research with Biology Professor Scott Boback on the ecological and environmental influences of nest-site selection in the Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta). Students have marked over 1,000 turtles in a 7 acre pond at a local hatchery. Because painted turtles are highly susceptible to global temperature changes, understanding parameters of nest selections and hatchling sex and survival is critical to the future of this species.

Nanoparticles and Green Chemistry: Katelyn Cohen '12 and Aaron Brumbaugh '14 worked with Chemistry Professor Sarah St. Angelo to test green chemistry processes for synthesizing nanoparticles with lemongrass and ginko extracts as reducing agents. Green chemistry reduces the use of toxic agents and volumes of waste generated. Their paper, “Green synthesis and characterization of bioreduced nanoparticles”, was accepted for presentation as a poster at the April 2013 conference of the American Chemical Society. Aaron received a Ciba Student Travel Award from the Green Chemistry Institute to attend the conference and present the poster, one of only four students to receive the national award.

We began with Duke's October 2013 STARS submission. In that submission, we identified faculty who conduct sustainability research using multiple methods:

1. The Office of Research Support's Sponsored Projects Systems Database, searching by key word for sustainability related research. This search focused on grants funded for environmentally-focused sustainability research using keywords in the title or body of the text (climat*, sustainabl*, conservation, energy, water, environment*, ecosystem, renewable, fisheries, habitat, carbon dioxide, CO2, methane, greenhouse, waste, transportation, fuel -- with * as a character wild card). 

2. Faculty listings in the Nicholas School of the Environment.

3. The Duke Campus Farm's website.

4. Faculty listings on departmental websites, including but not limited to Chemistry, Duke Global Health Institute, Economics, Law School, Sanford School of Public Policy, Sociology, Women's Studies

To update the inventory, we cleaned the previous database (removed duplicates and faculty we identified may not meet our sustainability criteria or who no longer work at Duke). Next we added to the inventory: We reviewed all research projects with awards received between July 1, 2012 and August 2014 (at https://ors.duke.edu/awards) and included the principal investigators of projects that, according to a trained reviewer, met environmental, economic, or social sustainability criteria.

We also added staff, including non-regular track faculty (who were excluded in the previous submission), laboratory managers, associates in research, etc., who conduct sustainability research from the departments identified in the inventory.","A Bass Connections Project is working to understand global health in the Peruvian Amazon

Linda McCauley, Dean of the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, is conducting research on the effects of climate change and increased heat on the health of agricultural workers and also on methods to provide pesticide education to workers speaking indigenous languages.  She is a member of the Institute of Medicine’s Board on Population Health and the Roundtable on Environmental Health.  Most recently she served on the National Academy of Sciences Advisory Group for the Gulf Research Program.  

Dierdra Reber, Assistant Professor, Department of Spanish, researches contemporary Latin American and U.S. media (film, television, advertising, and political discourse) to explore the cultural shift from reason, which became dominant with the birth of free-market capitalism in the eighteenth-century age of revolution, to a greater emphasis on feeling, emotion, and sensory perception, as described in her new book, Coming to Our Senses: Affect and an Order of Things for Global Culture.  Current work also combines interests in postcolonial studies and contemporary sustainability discourse to understand the construction of social legitimacy and power.

Justin Remais, Associate Professor, Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health was recently awarded $2.5 million by the NSF Water, Sustainability and Climate Program to address waterborne disease risks in a changing and variable climate, using as test sites well-studied regions in western China and northern Ecuador. The project brings together earth scientists, environmental engineers, mathematical modelers, social scientists, and epidemiologists from five universities to develop open-source computational models for estimating the risk of infectious disease transmission in changing environments. Recent publications also address food safety and water sanitation challenges in China and modeling approaches for estimating health co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.

GW defines departments as those divisions with a department chair.  52 is the number 
of GW departments excluding the medical school (and de facto excluding nursing, which does not have departments) 
","Sabrina McCormick is a sociologist and filmmaker and an Associate Professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health.  Dr. McCormick takes an in-depth, mechanistic approach to understanding how climate change gets under the skin. She works on extreme impacts of climate-related phenomena like heat waves, emergent vector-borne disease, and climate-related disasters. She was a Lead Author on a Special Assessment by the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change entitled “Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation.” Dr. McCormick’s award-winning documentary film work aims to transform science into stories that compel social action. She was a Producer on The Years of Living Dangerously, a nine-part Showtime series that earned the Emmy Award for Best Documentary in 2014. 

Claire Monteleoni is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Despite the scientific consensus on climate change, drastic uncertainties remain. Crucial questions about changes in regional climate, trends of extreme events such as heat waves, heavy precipitation, and mega-storms, and understanding how climate varied in the distant past, must be answered in order to improve predictions, assess impacts and vulnerability, and aid mitigation and adaptation efforts. Professor Monteleoni’s research helped launch the interdisciplinary field of climate informatics, with the goal of accelerating discovery in climate science with machine learning. Ongoing work on her NSF-sponsored project, Learning Relations between Extreme Weather Events and Planet-Wide Environmental Trends, a collaboration between GW, GMU, and U. Minnesota, includes a recent approach to automatically detect climate patterns from data, which can be used to study extreme events. 

Stuart Licht, a professor in the chemistry department, has taken on the challenge of developing a comprehensive solution to climate change. A new solar process has been introduced, the STEP process, which efficiently removes carbon from the atmosphere and generates the staples needed by society, ranging from fuels, to metals, bleach and construction materials, at high solar efficiency and without carbon dioxide generation. In the field of battery and fuel cell research new multiple electron (per molecule) storage processes are introduced and studied, leading to batteries with greater storage capacity than gasoline. On route to new pathways to utilize renewable energy, we explore fundamental chemical processes ranging from quantum mechanics to thermodynamics of water, new analytical and environmental methodologies, and hydrogen, halide, chalcogenide and transition metal chemistry.  

Maria Cseh is an Associate Professor in Human and Organizational Learning in the Graduate School of Education Human Development. Her current research is focused on global mindset, cultural intelligence and competence and their leaning and development that will help leaders and change agents address the increasingly complex issues facing our world. She is also continuing her inquiries into learning across cultures, including indigenous and informal learning to find creative and innovative sustainable solutions for healthy organizations and societies. 

Daniel Jacobs, Adjunct Professor of Political Science, is currently completing research on a forthcoming book on the BP Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig explosion and the nearly four million barrels of oil that spilled into the Gulf of Mexico.  His research reviews the lessons of the disaster from a management and sustainability standpoint, exposing the dangers that could cause another offshore oil disaster, and examining the business risks and the impact that corporations have on the environment and public health.
 
Ivy Ken is an Associate Professor of Sociology attentive to issues of inequality.  Her most recent work focuses on the challenges involved in providing children with school meals.  Dr. Ken has conducted fieldwork among food service management companies that supply schools, including tiny, two-person catering operations and massive, multinational corporations such as the Compass Group, Inc.  She has focused on one of the major trade-offs these companies must negotiate as they attempt to meet the mandate to provide food sustainably: paying for skilled labor to prepare locally-available produce or paying a premium for chopped, prepared, packaged foods.  Labor costs that cut into profit remain unappealing to the managers of both large and small food service companies, which ultimately restrict schools' opportunities to participate fully in programs like Farm To School that emphasize local, sustainable meals.  Dr. Ken teaches a course on School Food Policy, and has published recently on the topic of corporate influence in school meals in Social Currents and Contexts.

Stephen C. Smith is Professor of Economics and International Affairs.  He is author of Ending Global Poverty and co-author with Michael Todaro of Economic Development, among dozens of publications.  He is also Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, recently contributing “The Two Fragilities: Vulnerability to Conflict, Environmental Stress, and their Interactions as Challenges to Ending Poverty” for a forthcoming Brookings volume, The Last Mile in Ending Extreme Poverty.  Smith’s current work is funded by USAID (via the BASIS research program), including a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study of providing drip irrigation for villages in Senegal; and a “reverse-RCT” study of sustainable impacts of an agricultural extension program for smallholder women farmers in Uganda that was phased out when budgetary support ended.  You can read more about his work on development, climate resilience, and other topics at http://www.gwu.edu/~iiep/about/faculty/ssmith.

Amit Ronen is Director of the Solar Institute and a professor at the Trachenberg School.  In January 2014, in partnership with The Solar Foundation, he produced the 2014 Solar Jobs Census, the the only source of information about job creation in the solar sector. Over 75,000 solar businesses are asked to complete they survey and it is a highly read document found at:  www.solar.gwu.edu

Lance B. Price, professor of environmental and occupational health at The Milken Institute of Public Health and world-renowned expert on antibiotic resistance in livestock, spoke at a House of Representatives in the fall of 2014 to discuss the federal response to the massive outbreak of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in chicken that sickened hundreds.  Rep. Louise M. Slaughter and Rep. Rosa DeLauro held the hearing to call for action on curbing antibiotic over-use especially on factory farms. Dr. Price told lawmakers about the growing evidence that routine use of antibiotics in livestock can breed highly resistant strains of “superbugs.” - See more at: http://publichealth.gwu.edu/content/sphhs-professor-lance-price-urges-lawmakers-take-action-issue-antibiotic-resistance#sthash.Yr9tN6fd.dpuf
",https://sustainability.gwu.edu/research-institutes-centers,"1) The reported number of GW faculty engaged in research is for fiscal year 2014.  Not all GW faculty engage in research. To determine the number of GW faculty engaged in research, we obtained the number of principal investigators with sponsored research from a database maintained by the Office of the Vice President for Research. We believe that there are more GW faculty engaged in research, but this was the only data source available to us.
 
2) We did not count adjunct faculty in the total number of faculty engaged in sustainability research.  This is because of the magnitude of the search, our notion that the majority do not undertake research, and most importantly, because of the potential for these faculty to leave. Nevertheless, we have included a short list of adjunct faculty in the research inventory list because the Faculty Sustainability Committee felt that it was important to highlight their research and to facilitate connections between researchers. 

3) We have not counted faculty who are helping lead sustainability discussions at GW, but for whom research is a de minimus activity. People like Dr. Jerome Paulson, Director of the Mid-Atlantic Center for Children's Health and the Environment, and a member of both the Medical School and Milken Institute faculties, offer a great deal to the GW community and their contributions are not captured by the construction of this question.

4) Unlike 1.2 STARs this 2.0 version provides a definition of sustainability research.  In reviewing this definition, the pan-university GW Sustainability Faculty Committee noted that the 2.0 definition focuses on “economic prosperity” without an explicit reference to the critical dimension of social equity.  This was seen as a shortcoming and our faculty advise that it be amended in future iterations.

Awards:

Jacob Park , 2015 Environmental Merit Award, Environmental Protection Agency. Jacob, who serves as a director of Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility, was nominated in particular for his work on climate change education. In the spring of 2014, he served as project director and core faculty member on a student project exploring flood resiliency as a community development priority for Rutland County three years after Hurricane Irene. Working with scientists, city planners, government officials and other leaders, Jacob, in conjunction with other GMC faculty members and students, unveiled four key steps to institutionalize local flood resiliency in Vermont. That summer, in recognition of his leadership in this area, Jacob was also awarded the Community Climate Change Fellowship Award by EECapacity, a national environmental education training program led by Cornell University. He used the fellowship to work with farmers and agricultural groups on the growing impact of climate change on Vermont food and agricultural issues.

In 2014, Assistant Professor Robin Currey designed an initiative with Kompanion (a financial institution in Kyrgyzstan) that earned a $100,000 microfinance prize by the Second Selection Committee for the 5th European Microfinance Award. Microfinance is a source of loans for low-income entrepreneurs and small businesses. The project is the “Pasture Land Management Training Initiative: an Ethnoecological Approach to Pasture Land Preservation” implemented by Kompanion in the Kyrgyz Republic. Ethnoecology, the study of how people make decisions about natural resources management, and “finance,” are two disciplines that rarely intersect. Dr. Currey developed the ethnoecological approach and curriculum utilized in the project, which honors traditional practices of livestock farmers of Kyrgyzstan while they receive training. The project also includes a specialized ""Credit for Conservation"" loan that incentivizes natural resources preservation, especially pasture land. Through this program, Kompanion works to address widespread land degradation in the country. Since the launch of the program in 2011, more than 24,000 farmers were trained and increased their incomes by 30%. The objective of the award is to highlight opportunities for microfinance to improve environmental issues in developing countries and encourage the industry to find innovative solutions for global environmental concerns. The winner was chosen by the High Jury November 13, during European Microfinance Week.

Prof. John Van Hoesen (geology and environmental studies) received the 2013 Biggs Award for Excellence in Earth Science Teaching. The award, presented annually to one person by the Geological Society of America, recognizes innovative and effective teaching of earth science among early career faculty.

The work of Assistant Professor Sarah Mittlefehldt (Environmental Studies) and Associate Professor James Harding (Natural Resources Management) on the Poultney Woodshed Project earned the College the Governor’s Award for Environmental Excellence in 2013. The award recognizes the research and programmatic efforts behind creating the Poultney Woodshed Project (a community-based supply chain for sourcing the biomass plant’s woodchips locally), building the biomass plant, installing an energy use dashboard, achieving climate neutrality and educating the community about renewable energy.

The headcount for faculty and staff engaged in research includes all full-time faculty, both part-time faculty, and two staff members. 

The headcount does not include adjuncts and does not include most staff members, even though many adjuncts at Green Mountain College are engaged in sustainability research. For example, Adjunct Professor Kathy Doyle regularly presents on her research on conservation planning and inventorying and Adjunct Professor Ken Welch regularly presents on his research in energy efficiency and cold climate heat pumps.

Departments were identified for the purposes of the academic research inventory as programs that have a director during the 2014-2015 academic year. The Environmental Liberal Arts Program was not identified as a department with staff or faculty engaged in research as each faculty member active in the ELA program have a separate primary program/department.

","Instead of traditional, single-discipline departments, Hampshire's curriculum is organized into five interdisciplinary schools.  All schools have Deans.  For this survey, the Deans gave summaries of their faculty research.  There is research related to sustainability in all of the five schools.  The schools are described below.

School of Cognitive Science
The School of Cognitive Science (CS) engages students with interests ranging from psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience to animal behavior, child development, computer science, digital multimedia, and linguistics.
School of Critical Social Inquiry 

The School of Critical Social Inquiry (CSI) includes faculty trained in history, psychology, psychoanalysis, anthropology, economics, sociology, politics, law, philosophy, cultural studies, and education. What unites CSI is a common commitment to understanding the processes of social and cultural formations and their implications.

School of Humanities, Arts, and Cultural Studies
School of Humanities, Arts, and Cultural Studies (HACU) engages students with interests ranging from philosophy, literature, film, video, photography, history, dance, painting, art history, cultural theory and history, critical theory, religious studies, studio arts, to ancient studies, music, American studies, media studies, environmental design, and architecture. 

School for Interdisciplinary Arts
In the School for Interdisciplinary Arts (IA), students and professors work across boundaries of art forms such as theatre, sculpture, writing, literature, children's theatre, creative drama, and arts and social action.

School of Natural Science
School of Natural Science (NS) students involve themselves in original scientific research. Areas of interest include environmental sciences, agricultural studies, health sciences, and more. Students can--and do--concentrate in almost every branch of science, from astronomy and bioengineering to marine ecology and genetics.

","See research inventory for descriptions of notable research.

In addition, research with students that is helping to change campus culture:

Hampshire College Solar Project:
Steve Roof, Larry Archey, Beth Hooker
In July 2014, a sub-committee of Hampshire’s Environmental Committee comprised of faculty and staff began a process to select a solar firm for ground mounted solar arrays on campus. The Trustees of Hampshire College approved a partnership with a working group consisting of Solar City, Gehrlicher Solar, and Solar Design Associates and several sites across campus have been selected for solar development. Research on the economic and agricultural impacts of the solar project were conducted by Larry Archey and Beth Hooker respectively. Research on the greenhouse gas emission mitigation of the solar project was conducted by Steve Roof, professor of Earth and Environmental Science at Hampshire College. Several presentations were held on campus from December 2014-January 2015 to present this research to the Hampshire Community for feedback and discussion.

Steve Roof & Beth Hooker - Meadowlands Project
In Fall 2012 Sustainable Hampshire course, several first-year students developed a proposal to convert mowed lawns to ecologically-diverse meadows and useful hay pastures.  Hampshire College President Jonathan Lash endorsed their idea, and asked that a full proposal be developed.  Several additional students have been working on the project this spring, studying the soil types, identifying appropriate plants and wildlife to enhance, and developing maintenance plans.

Chemistry professor Dula Amarasiriwardena worked with students in a course last fall to verify that tap water meets all EPA standards. This faculty/student research is part of Hampshire's work on sustainability and ceasing to sell bottled water. Results were posted for the community.

Annear’s research focuses on the relationship between an ethnically heterogeneous population and an ecologically dynamic fishery in South-Central Africa. He is interested in how communities adapt to variable environments and the effectiveness of management and legislation of these areas. He studies a multiethnic highly mobile population of fishers, traders and farmers in northern Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo. He examines how people living on this fishery maintain its sustainability as a shared natural resource; how external constraints such as laws governance and historical circumstances affect constituent behaviors and choices; and how this ecologically dynamic fishery constrains some human communities but politically endows others.
Annear’s scholarship includes a book review, ""”Inside African Anthropology” (2014)

Professor Nan Crystal Arens - Geoscience
Aren’s research focuses on the evolution of terrestrial environments and the interplay between physical environmental change (e.g., climate and atmosphere) and changes in community composition and structure, evolution of plant autecology and eco-morphology, early angiosperm ecology and evolution, extinction mechanisms, and climate reconstruction method development—CLAMP.

Professor Sigrid Carle - Biology
Carle’s research is often in collaboration with Dr. Tom Burr, a member of the Plant Pathology department at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station located in Geneva, N.Y. They are interested in understanding the interactions between the pathogenic bacterium, Agrobacterium vitis, and its host plant, grape. Agrobacterium vitis causes two diseases on grape: crown gall disease on grapevines and necrosis on grape roots. Crown gall is a tumor-like growth that reduces productivity of the vine. Necrosis is characterized by localized lesions on roots from which viable bacteria can be isolated. Since grape constitutes an important crop plant in wine-producing areas, including New York, the control of A. vitis infections is of great interest. In particular, we are interested in learning as much as possible about the infection process, such that genetic engineering could be used to induce a defense response in grape upon contact with A. vitis, thus protecting the grape from infection.

Associate Professor Kirin Makker - Architectural Studies 
Makker’s scholarship concerns the planning and development of small towns and rural areas. My dissertation (Ph.D., 2010) was called Building Main Street: Village Improvement and the Small Town Ideal. It tells the story of citizen-led/governance-centered planning and design in small towns before the advent of professional planning and municipal works offices during the period from 1820s-1890s. She is currently preparing a revised version of the dissertation as a book manuscript centered on the American village improvement movement’s alignment with the development of scenic preservation in the nineteenth century. This manuscript is currently under consideration by UMass Press as part of their series Critical Perspectives in the History of Environmental Design. Makker is also working on a second research project, this one focused on the developmental history of small town America during its building boom, circa 1870-1930. In 2013-2014, I was honored with the award of a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship to do research on the development of small town main streets using the trade catalog collection at Winterthur Museum and Library. She maintains a blog on this ongoing research, posting monthly, called “The Myths of Main Street.” This blog is aimed at a broad audience, as I hope this book will have wide appeal and be of interest to both planning scholars, professionals and the public. 

Assistant Professor Whitney Mauer – Environmental Studies
Mauer’s scholarly interests include environmental inequalities; American Indian and indigenous environmental issues; and poverty, development, and environment. Her research examines the complex ways that environmental issues intersect with issues of race and ethnicity, inequality and stratification, indigeneity, community, and development.   She is in the process of developing a collaborative research project with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, examining an environmental restoration project as a development strategy, in particular its effects on community, place, access to resources, and power.  

Stanley Mathews – Architectural Studies
Mathews is the Colleges’ resident authority on architectural history, theory and design. He also has expertise in design, drawing, woodworking, welding, sculpture, furniture making, graphic design, digital imaging, and structural engineering. Within the liberal arts setting of the Colleges, the wide range of my experience is an asset, and I derive great satisfaction from being able to use my range of skills. Mathews views the subject of architecture very broadly as a way of comprehending and shaping our surroundings, and as the quintessential convergence of disciplines. Architecture is inherently interdisciplinary discourse at the juncture between idealism and pragmatism, between art, physics, mathematics, psychology, anthropology, economics, politics and the environment, and he tries to convey these convergences in his teaching. Indeed, his teaching is essentially interdisciplinary. In classes, he constantly makes connections between architecture and philosophy, or related social and cultural histories.

Assistant Professor Nicholas Metz - Geoscience
Metz’s scholarly interests include synoptic and mesoscale interactions, mesoscale convective systems near the Great Lakes, effects of high-impact weather on climate, and Southern Hemisphere cold surges. 

Recent publications include: 
Metz, N. D., H. M. Archambault, A. F. Srock, T. J. Galarneau Jr., and L. F. Bosart, 2013: A Comparison of South American and African Preferential Pathways for Extreme Cold Events. Mon. Wea. Rev., 141, 2066–2086.

Beth Newell - Biology
Newell’s research interests are in the areas of plant ecology, physiological ecology, community ecology, and tropical ecology. For example, she and her students have been comparing the physiology of related evergreen and deciduous plant species in a sphagnum bog north of Geneva, a fascinating community type that is now rare in western New York. The majority of her research publications focus on research completed on the physiology of trees and shrubs in the rainforests of Central America. A new focus for Newell’s scholarship is international agricultural development and conservation. Because agriculture is the largest single land use in many developing countries, ensuring that agricultural activities are environmentally sustainable is key to protecting biodiversity and natural resources as well as improving the food security of human communities. Newell is a member of the HWS Fribolin Farm Steering Committee.

Craig Rimmerman – Political Science
Rimmerman’s scholarly and research interests include lesbian and gay movements and public policy; the New Citizenship, and service-learning and the liberal arts. 

Recently published works include:
Craig A. Rimmerman, The Lesbian and Gay Movements:  Assimilation or Liberation? (2nd edition; published August 2014; dated 2015)

Visiting Assistant Professor Tarah Rowse – Environmental Studies
Rowse’s research interests include sustainability across the campus and energy policy. These interests are grounded in the study of sustainability transitions, drawing on the disciplines of natural sciences, policy, management, and social psychology. Furthermore, she uses participatory action research to develop my investigations in partnership with community-based actors. This supports the translation of rigorous applied research to practical implementation

Sustainable Energy Systems Laboratories (SESL)

The existing expertise and experience at McMaster University form a firm base for innovative programs in photovoltaics, solar, wind, fuel cells, nuclear energy and conservation and energy modeling united under the overarching theme of developing energy systems with small environmental impacts that minimize resource requirements and at the same time are economically viable.

Conservation and Energy Modeling

Currently MIES is involved in energy demand analysis and policy evaluation work with three major research themes:  energy market behaviour; social and economic/demographic issues; and energy production in a sustainable environment. 


Fuel Cells

The Fuel Cell research forms an integrating bridge between the solar and wind energy technologies because these energy sources are inherently intermittent and require either energy storage or back-up systems in order to function as reliable providers of electricity to the grid.

Nuclear Energy

As a result of recent decisions, Nuclear Power will play an important role in electricity generation in Canada for decades into the future. 

Solar Energy

Photovoltaic (PV) energy, the direct conversion of sunlight into electricity, can potentially supply a significant portion of Canada’s rapidly growing demand for electricity with minimal environmental consequences.


Supercapacitors

Electrochemical supercapacitors (ES) are urgently needed as components in many advanced power systems requiring high power density. A new wave of interest in electrochemical supercapacitors is related to the development of electric and fuel cell vehicles.


Wind Energy	

Wind Energy is the fastest growing renewable energy source in Canada. In 2006, installed wind capacity exceeded 1,000 MW making Canada the 12th largest country in wind energy.
",Emails were sent to each professor involved with sustainability with questions and were then noted.,"Here are information on two of the above researchers. 

Ray LaPierre is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Engineering Physics with interests in compound semiconductor (group III-V) nanowires, molecular beam epitaxy, and applications in photovoltaics, photodetectors and quantum information processing. He is developing nanowire-based solar cells that will reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of current silicon-based technology. To overcome the limitations of current solar technology, it is highly desirable to combine the high performance of III-V materials with the relatively low cost of Si technology, thereby achieving the best of both worlds. Recent work in photovoltaics is beginning to exploit intentionally engineered III-V semiconductor nanowire arrays that can be grown directly on Si.  Dr. LaPierre has shown that a III-V nanowire array integrated with Si is capable of 33.8% photovoltaic efficiency (1 Sun) or 42.3% under concentrated light (500 Suns).  He has published over 70 articles on nanowire-based devices with an emphasis in photovoltaics.   



John Preston's research efforts are directed towards next generation photovoltaic and thermoelectric materials.  Recent accomplishments include the development of II-VI materials as quantum dots, wires and thin films with perfect crystalline order but detachable from the substrate used to nucleate their growth.  This opens the avenue to high performance but low cost photovoltaics.  Preston's group is also working on new approaches to improve conventional thermoelectric materials by manipulating their dimensions and structures at the nanoscale for energy harvesting applications.  For the past 4 years, Preston has been the Director of the NSERC CREATE PV Training Program.  This is a regional centre for training Engineers and Scientists in Advanced Photovoltaics hosted at McMaster.  Over 60 undergraduate and graduate students have benefited from the training opportunities provided by this program

https://sustainability.ncsu.edu/curriculum-research/","The researchers and faculty that participate in sustainability related work were  identified by various sources such as the SPARCS research database, NC State Cleantech Inventory, Global Change Symposium, Environmental Science Academic Program, Academic Sustainability Leaders, Sustainability and Lifecycle Analysis report, and various sustainability-related committees and faculty clusters.  Eight University Sustainability Office partners on the ""sustainability in research database team"" filled out the database fields with College, Department, webpage and email address using publicly available information available on NC State's website. The total researchers was determined by using the two main Sponsored Programs and Regulatory Compliance (SPARCS) data sets for 1) campus researchers with a #5 account and 2) their 2015 list of Principal Investigators and co-Principal Investigators. Researchers that showed up in both the SPARCS lists as well as the sustainability list were determined to be ""sustainability researchers"" for the purpose of STARS reporting.

When a faculty/ researcher was listed more than once by slight name variations, we selected the more formal or complete. For example, we chose the name FIRST, MIDDLE, LAST over FIRST, LAST. There are possible errors when collecting data on individuals. The data could have accidentally selected out or in: Nicknames, Maiden names, Father/son with same name, Two different people with the same name. If there were misspellings in the data presented, the misspellings may still exist. There is a subjective nature to the process of defining sustainability in research. Research which considers the social and environmental aspects of research in addition to financial aspects is considered sustainability in research at NC State.

Survey results were used to compile an initial list of faculty who conduct sustainability research, and of sustainability research projects.

The researchers so identified were added to a searchable database of faculty with expertise in sustainability, energy, and/ or the environment, maintained by the Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment.  The database can be found here: http://www.sustainability.psu.edu/learn/researchers/expert-database
For the current STARS submission we obtained a list of research grants active as of June 30, 2013, and reviewed this list to identify sustainability research projects, and faculty serving as lead or co-principal investigators of these projects.  The faculty list was cross-checked with that developed previously to update and expand our list of faculty who conduct sustainability research.

Total number of faculty engaged in research includes 2013 headcount of faculty (from Penn State Factbook Plus), with academic rank of professor, associate professor, or assistant professor; and research faculty with rank of senior scientist, senior research associate, or research associate (generally, all PhD level designations).  Lecturers and Research Assistants were NOT included in the count.
Likewise, the list and count of faculty engaged in sustainability research includes only faculty at those same academic and research ranks.

Counts of academic departments: 
19 faculty on our list of faculty who conduct sustainability research are appointed directly through a research institute or center that resides at the college or inter-college level, not through an academic department.  Due to the difficulty of enumerating ALL institutes and centers at Penn State, our departmental numbers above include only academic departments, and faculty affiliated with them.

","Pitzer College describes sustainability research as scholarship and pedagogy that engages with social, ecological and economic sustainability. In sum, we see scholarship that addresses social inequality as well as environmental challenges as both linked to sustainability research. In order to complete this section, we looked at each faculty member's profile at the college and determined whether their work fell into the broad category of social, ecological, or economic sustainability. 

Pitzer College is a liberal arts institution, which prioritizes values of environmental sustainability and community engagement. Many of our faculty thus implicitly or explicitly address questions, teaching and research around sustainability.","Below are some highlights of faculty and staff engagement, including research, around sustainability. Some student work is also included, since this was directed by faculty mentors. This is not a comprehensive list.

Worthington and colleagues from other sites around the world presented the results showing citizen views on ways to preserve biodiversity at the biodiversity convention, where authorities requested that this form of citizen input continue at its biennial meetings and be integrated with its decision-making processes.  A report on the project was presented at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in December 2012.

Heather Williams, Department of Politics, co-founded the Suma Quta Watershed Defense Project in the Lake Titicaca basin with her counterpart Javier Bojorquez, of Puno, Peru. This project, meaning ""Beautiful Lake"" in the Aymara language, focuses on improving aquatic ecosystems and public health by monitoring water quality and working with communities on strategies for purifying water and eliminating point sources of pollution. Williams has taken three students to the Altiplano to conduct feasibility studies on monitoring methods, evaluate effectiveness of monitor training by the network, and evaluate point sources of pollution, work that has morphed into the local project that current Environmental Analysis major seniors are conducting on the Santa Ana River for the basin's waterkeepers.

David Tanenbaum, Department of Physics, with Scott Berkeley '09, Jenna deBoisblanc '11, Leo Rosetti '12,  Gretta Mae Ferguson '13, Robert McElwaine, '14, and Emily Yang '14, has since 2008 been working in Tanenbaum's research lab exploring fabrication and characterization of low-cost, high-stability polymer solar cells.  Much of this work is in collaboration with Professor Fredrik Krebs from Denmark.  Tanenbaum spent academic year 2010-2011 with Krebs while on sabbatical leave from Pomona.  Also, since 2009, Tanenbaum, with Ben Pollard '11, Matthew Hasling '12, and Eric Puma '14, has been exploring fabrication of graphene sheets via chemical vapor deposition, which could be used as transparent electrodes in low cost solar cells based on a long standing collaboration with Professor Paul McEuen from Cornell University.

We also sent an email to the department chairs asking them to identify faculty/staff in their departments who conduct sustainability research. ","There have been a number of notable accomplishments during the previous three years.  To highlight just a few: 

(1) In November of 2012, Rice University scientists unveiled a revolutionary new technology that uses nanoparticles to convert solar energy directly into steam.  The new “solar steam” method from Rice’s Laboratory for Nanophotonics is so effective it can even produce steam from icy cold water.  The inventors of solar steam steam said they expect the first uses of the new technology will be used for sanitation and water purification in developing countries.  

(2) An article published June 3, 2014 discusses a new breakthrough in sustainable technology developed at Rice University: Rice University scientists have created an Earth-friendly way to separate carbon dioxide from natural gas at wellheads.  A porous material invented by the Rice lab of chemist James Tour sequesters carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, at ambient temperature with pressure provided by the wellhead and lets it go once the pressure is released. The material shows promise to replace more costly and energy-intensive processes. Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel. Development of cost-effective means to separate carbon dioxide during the production process will improve this advantage over other fossil fuels and enable the economic production of gas resources with higher carbon dioxide content that would be too costly to recover using current carbon capture technologies, Tour said.

(3) The Center for Energy and Environmental Research in the Human Sciences (CENHS) is a notable accomplishment for Rice’s sustainability research. It is the newest part of Rice University’s landmark Energy and Environment Initiative (E2I), the first effort to involve all the intellectual resources of a major research university in addressing today’s most pressing energy and environmental challenges.  CENHS is likewise a first-of-its-kind: the only research center in the world specifically designed to sponsor research on the energy/environment nexus across the arts, humanities, and social sciences.  CENHS builds upon over two years of work by the Cultures of Energy Faculty Working Group at Rice, which helped to pioneer the field of interdisciplinary energy humanities in conjunction with a Sawyer Seminar grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. 

(4) An article published March 13, 2014 discusses research conducted on renewable energy in Mexico: For Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec to successfully transition to such renewable energy forms as wind power, its government must more fully engage constituents in implementation, execution and profit strategies, according to a new report by Rice anthropologists.  In the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project “The Political Culture of Wind Power Development in Southern Mexico,” Cymene Howe, assistant professor of anthropology, and Dominic Boyer, professor of anthropology, examined wind power development in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region of Oaxaca, Mexico. The authors said that while Mexico is heavily dependent on both fossil-fuel production and consumption, it has set one of the most ambitious targets for clean-electricity generation — 35 percent by 2024 – of any nation.  The authors conducted 16 months of fieldwork between 2009 and 2013 and focused on wind-power development in Oaxaca. Howe and Boyer found that Oaxaca’s wind sector has developed very quickly, resulting in a 1,467 percent increase that has made Mexico the second-biggest wind-power producer in Latin America after Brazil.",http://sustainability.rice.edu/teaching-and-research/,--

Graduate Research Assistants, Center for Sustainability (x4)
Graduate Assistants, Facilities Services (x2)","A survey was sent to the chairperson of each academic department asking them to identify sustainability research activities within his or her department
","Saint Louis University faculty members engaged in sustainability research also publish regularly. Below is an example of notable research being conducted by Center for Sustainability assistant professor, Dr. Damon Hall.  For a list of recent publications and accomplishments of other Center faculty, please visit the profile pages on the Center for Sustainability Website: http://www.slu.edu/sustainability/about-us/faculty

Center faculty members also collaborate with faculty members in other departments and at other University's on research and interdisciplinary grant proposals.To solve complex sustainability problems, requires teams of experts both within the university, across disciplines, and outside of the university across sectors. For example, the collaborative research that Dr. Damon Hall is involved with integrates biophysical research with social science for the purposes of applying knowledge to decision making that fosters transitions towards sustainability. These efforts have united faculty from biology, earth and atmospheric sciences, sustainability, sociology, communication, ecology, geography, natural resources, forestry, anthropology, and information sciences departments around the country for the purpose of addressing society's most pressing problems. These problems include managing urban streams, urban sustainability design, crowd sourced hydrologic models for predictive decision making, floodplain management, drought impacts on water quality and its mitigation, and public-private partnerships for urban pollinator conservation throughout North America. The aim is collaborative contribution to methods that help shape transformational sustainability science.  ",http://www.slu.edu/sustainability/research,--

(2) Contacted CEJS (Center for Environmental Justice and Sustainability) and received the names of CEJS affiliated sustainability faculty experts at SU
(3) Research on SU website","Some notable accomplishments by SU faculty/staff engaged in sustainability research:

(1) KiloWatts for Humanity:
Members of Seattle University's Electrical and Computer Engineering department have founded the non-profit organization KiloWatts for Humanity to help bring power to rural villages around the world. The organization's most recent project has been to install microgrids that power energy kiosks using solar panels in Filibaba, Zambia. The kiosks will give community members the ability to charge their appliances and light sources and bring electricity into their homes through these electronics.

(2) Design and Feasibility Study of Anaerobic Digestion at Seattle University
Team CEE 15.6 (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering) partnered with SU Facilities Services (SUFS) to study the feasibility of implementing an anaerobic digester for the campus’ post-consumer, compostable waste. The implementation of an

Every March, academic departments report a list of active projects to SURe. Furthermore, funded projects are tracked independently by SURe.

Sustainability-related applied research projects were then identified from the list of active research projects and key personnel associated with these projects from various academic departments were contacted for more information. The OfS in collaboration with the Project Coordinator at SURe ,identified and documented all the faculty and staff engaged in all kinds of applied /funded research at Sheridan. Additional collaborators from faculty/staff for each sustainability-related projects were identified and listed by the OfS.

A final record of all faculty/staff involved in all kinds of applied research and those among them involved in sustainability research, was sent back to SURe for corroboration.

SFU researchers lead several Automotive Partnerships Canada and industry-supported projects to develop cheaper, more efficient and durable applications for sustainable transportation, energy storage, and power generation. 
These include:
•	A national network of six Canadian companies and 20 top researchers and engineers to reduce the cost of fuel cell production;
•	An SFU-Ballard Power Systems collaboration to advance fuel cell and battery research and development;
•	A project with British Columbia’s Future Vehicle Technologies to improve thermal management for hybrid vehicles, and;
•	A project with several industry partners to improve air conditioning and refrigeration systems for long-haul commercial vehicles.
3.	World’s First Evolutionary Ranking of Birds
An international research team led by SFU biologist Arne Mooers and Walter Jetz from Yale University has developed the world’s first evolutionary ranking of all 9,993 species of birds. They combined the “evolutionary distinctiveness” index published by SFU PhD student Dave Redding in Nature in 2012 with data on extinction risk and maps of bird habitats to identify those species most at risk of extinction.  The London Zoo plans to use the new rankings in a major conservation initiative called theEdge of Existence program.

Individual faculty members were asked to complete an online form with questions regarding sustainability courses, learning outcomes, and research.  ","Kara Belinsky (Biology) studies the behavior, ecology, and conservation of songbirds.  Her dissertation research focused on the evolution of plumage color and singing performance in two species of wood warblers (chestnut-sided and yellowthroat). More recently, she has studied the song repertoire of a thrush species, the veery. Veeries sing acoustically complex songs, which feature multiple frequencies sung simultaneously. In order to understand how this language works, she recorded natural veery singing behavior and conducted playback experiments to test hypotheses about the function of specific songs and calls.  Kara is beginning new research here at New Paltz that aims to understand how urbanization affects songbird habitat choice and use, with the goal of learning how to create a more bird-friendly campus and village.  To conduct this research, she established a network of bird feeders located in different habitats across campus including suburban, rural, and forested locations on or adjacent to campus.

Salvatore Engel-Di Mauro (Geography) has been carrying out externally funded research involving field and lab work on processes of heavy metal contamination in urban gardens in various cities. The research will be used to promote urban gardening by helping urban gardeners figure out how to avoid or mitigate contamination problems. In 2014 he published a book on soils and soil degradation.  In 2011 he conducted research on soil acidification and the published results of this research is forthcoming.

Megan Ferguson (Chemistry) studies a predatory bacterium that is harmless to humans (and is present in most people's digestive tract) but can eat a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria, including pathogenic strains that may be resistant to conventional chemical antibiotics.  She also examines the nanostructure of wings of dragonflies, damselflies, and other insects; certain nanostructures appear to have antibacterial properties.

Andrea Frank (Art - Photography) is conducting collaborative system drawing sessions with SUNY New Paltz and local area participants, addressing issues related to sustainability with the campus and town community in the context of the feed back - future feed initiative.  Feed back future feed is a ongoing series of workshops that gather together students, faculty, staff, local community members, and subject matter experts to collectively envision radically sustainable and innovative systems, which integrate the interconnected concepts of food, waste, energy, habitat, transportation, data, labor, and social structures.   Workshop participants are challenged to adopt a systems thinking perspective to lead to new societal paradigms.  

Sarah Hsu (Economics) wrote and edited a book series on sustainable development in Asia.

Matthew Friday (Art) and Aaron Knochel are participating on a team research project that examines how people interact with physical spaces on college campuses and teh impact that physical space has on community development, education, and ecologically awareness.

Anne Galperin (Art - Graphic Design) researches the social, health, and environmental dimensions of educational and public spaces.

Eric Keeling (Biology) presented ""More Intervention in Wilderness?  The Case of Forests, Fire, and Climate in the Northern Rockies"" at the Wilderness 50th Anniversary Conference in Albuquerque.  This work challenges some common assumptions about about resilience and the need for increasing management intervention in wilderness ecosystems.  With coauthors, he is working on a manuscript on this topic for publication.

With Larry McGlinn, Huicheng Chien (Geography) is researching water quality impacts of a no-mow lawn buffer vs. a mowed lawn area adjacent to the largest pond at SUNY New Paltz.

Daniel Lipson (Political Science) published “Is The Great Recession Only the Beginning? Economic Contraction in an Age of Fossil Fuel Depletion and Ecological Limits to Growth” in the December edition of New Political Science.

Kate McCoy (Education) has recently studied the historical relationship between settler colonialism in the United States, capitalist enterprise, drug cash crop agriculture (tobacco), and environmental issues.

Ro Millham (Secondary Education) studies environmental factors (including weather, run-off, tides, phases of the moon, etc.) that affect the yearly population count for glass eels in Black Creek.  She assesses (1) how the Hudson River Estuary and its environs limit or promote glass eel success, (2) anthropogenic considerations relative to the health and vigor of glass eel populations, and (3) why population levels for glass eels at Black Creek often surpass those of other Hudson River tributaries in the mid-Hudson region.  She also performs research in the composite material arena which is directly used in reducing vehicle weight and wind turbine blades. She works with SunStrand, LLC, a company that develops bamboo and other sustainable natural fibers for use as reinforcements in plastics (composites). Developing products to help achieve LEED certification, etc. has been a primary focus. 

Brian Obach (Sociology) has written a forthcoming book on the organic agriculture movement.  He has published an article on the relationship between economic systems and ecological degradation.  In addition, he has written several encyclopedia entries on sustainable agriculture issues and a chapter in a textbook on environmental sociology.

Jill Parisi (Art - Printmaking) is researching strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of papermaking and increase the growth or procurement of local native plant material material to make into paper using a beater.  She is also researching the possibility of upcycling paper waste generated by the campus into paper in printmaking classes.  Currently, this paper is being downcycled through single-stream recycling.

Emily Puthoff (Scuplture) and Elena Sniezek traveled across the Northeast in a custom-made solar-powered teardrop trailer in the summer of 2014.  Emily designed and hand-built the trailer to have conversations with people about their ideas of progress, which included dimensions of sustainability. The trailer features a large solar-powered TV with which they screen the nomadic Wayfinding Series Film Festival along with their travels.  Emily Puthoff and Elena Sniezek reviewed through hours of video from an international applicant pool and curated a diversity of short videos that address the theme of progress from the Hudson Valley and across the world.  Emily challenged the people she met on her journey to ask questions such as ""Do you think progress is possible? If so, what does progress look like? What can be done here, now, in your own life?"" What began with a deep curiosity to meet and talk with people about the notion of progress has become the Wayfinding Series, A Work in Progress.

David Richardson (Biology) and his students are assessing the effects of green infrastructure at SUNY New Paltz on water quality.

With Brian Obach, kt Tobin (CRREO / Sociology) published ""Agriculture Supporting Community in the Mid Hudson Region."" http://www.newpaltz.edu/crreo/crreo_brief_5_summer_2011.pdf  She also is the Principal Investigator for ""Planning and Implementing Green Infrastructure to Improve Watershed Resiliency in the Saw Mill Brook Watershed and Village of New Paltz"" with funding from the Cornell NYS Water Resources Institute and  NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program.

Summer 2015 - Continuation of the Upper Black River Stabilization Project: funded by the Town of Craftsbury, through the Craftsbury Conservation Commission. Again, I hired 1 student to assist me in the field documenting presences of Japanese knotweed as well as areas of unstable stream banks along specific reaches of the Black River. The student created GIS maps of these areas. The Watershed Analysis class and Wildlife Conservation class collected data which will be used in the final write up."" We will continue this project for several more years until we have covered the entire Black River watershed (in Craftsbury). 

Research by Nicole Civita includes the following:

- Research federal enhanced tax deduction for donations of food and produce a legal guide in collaboration with the University of Arkansas School of Law & the Harvard Food Law & Policy Clinic

- Research laws pertaining to the use of excess human food as livestock feed at the federal level and in all 50 states for inclusion in a forthcoming legal guide and presentation at food recovery related conferences around the country.

- Research agri-food system drivers of climate change and the contours of resilience focused food policy.  

Research by Charlotte Rosendahl includes the following:

--A long term experiment looking at the changes in microbial community structure, plant yield and plant health in biochar amended soil in a continues vegetable rotation.

The Hemlock Ecosystem Management Study (HEMS) investigates the relationships among biotic and abiotic variables on plant and animal biodiversity. It focuses on the effects of the invasive insect, hemlock woolly adelgid, and of recommended forestry practices within the north woods. With funding from the National Science Foundation’s EPSCoR program, data is collected annually from research plots on five sites in central Maine. Project participants identify and record plants, decomposition rates, light availability, and other factors and compare the data across years. The information they gain will help Maine manage the effects of the hemlock woolly adelgid and inform recommended forestry practices that will sustain the north woods.

Wind Power Assessment
With both interest and controversy surrounding wind farms growing, it’s imperative that researchers provide information for sound decision-making. For that reason, Mick Womersley is evaluating the potential for wind-power generation at different sites across Maine. Mick’s Wind Power Assessment project was recently awarded $110,000 of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and has the potential to inform how wind power sites are selected in Maine. The study involves anemometers, small digital devices that measure and record wind strength. Mick and his crew of Unity students erect metal towers and attach anemometers, from which they later retrieve data that can help increase the accuracy of wind-power predictions in Maine.

Sediment history of Unity Pond.
This study is analyzing sediment age from multiple sites via lead (210Pb) dating to indicate possible historic rates and potential causes of nutrient release. Water and sediment concentrations of P, Al and Fe will be monitored weekly over the course of one year to evaluate the behavior of these elements at the sediment/water interface as environmental conditions change. Additionally, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) at three different water depths will be measured to understand the environmental conditions that contribute to P release.

A unifying theme in our research is to understand the balance between natural and anthropogenic sources of trace gases and aerosols in earth's atmosphere, and to elucidate the biogeochemical processes which control their budgets. One of our major foci is to push the forefront of observational capabilities through the development and deployment of novel analytical instrumentation, making possible new avenues of research to address elusive scientific questions. We develop instrumentation, develop and maintain long term biosphere-atmosphere exchange experiments, engage in short term field campaigns, perform controlled laboratory experiments, and utilize models of atmospheric processes, all with the goals of understanding the composition and chemistry of earth's atmosphere, how it functions naturally, and how it is impacted by anthropogenic emissions and changing climate.",--,--

A PDF of the 2016 Sustainability Research Inventory is available at http://sustainability.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/02/Sustainability-Research-Inventory-2016.pdf
","The 2016 UC Irvine Sustainability Research Inventory is based on the definition of sustainability research outlined in STARS 2.0.1 and includes, at minimum, all research centers, laboratories, departments, and faculty members whose research focuses on or is related to sustainability. The resulting inventory includes the names of all faculty engaged in sustainability research, along with their department affiliations, and a list of every department in which at least one faculty member engages in sustainability research. 

The process outlined below was followed to specifically identify UC Irvine faculty engaged in sustainability research. 

•	To develop the initial inventory, an email was sent to all faculty in April 2012, asking them to self-identify; some faculty responded not only on their own behalf but also identified other faculty members who should be included on the list. A follow-up communication was sent to deans and department chairs, asking them to encourage faculty to respond.
•	Various campus websites were consulted to learn the names of faculty affiliated with centers doing research in this area.
•	Titles and department affiliations were validated with the Office of Academic Personnel, and URLs for faculty profiles were obtained using the campus’s online directory and departmental websites.
•	In 2013, 2014, 2015 and again in 2016, copies of the previous year’s sustainability research inventory were distributed to all listed faculty for review with a request for updates, additions, and deletions. 
•	In 2013, 2014, 2015 and again in 2016, new faculty (i.e., hired after the previous inventory) were identified and contacted, requesting them to self-identify if engaged in sustainability research. 
•	In 2016, the online data gathering tool Formstack was adopted and two forms were created to gather information for the inventory. The two forms were customized for either new faculty, or faculty listed in the 2015 inventory. The existing faculty form included one extra question: if faculty would like to update their listing or not, or if they would like their listing to be removed. A URL to the online forms was distributed in the initial email to the two faculty groups. The faculty responses have been incorporated.
•	Prior to finalizing the 2016 Sustainability Research Inventory, the academic deans of all UCI Schools were contacted to verify the inventory of faculty engaged in sustainability research and ensure that all appropriate researchers were included. 
•	The deans were asked to review a list of all faculty from their school who were included in the 2015 inventory, sorted by school and department, and identify any individuals who were no longer in their schools. 
•	The deans were also asked to nominate any new faculty, who could be characterized as doing sustainability-related research. Faculty identified by the deans were contacted and asked to provide the required information for the sustainability research inventory by completing the new online form. ","""UCI study finds dramatic increase in concurrent droughts, heat waves""
Researchers use unique statistical analysis to identify dual climate threat. Droughts and heat waves are happening simultaneously with much greater frequency than in the past, according to research by climate experts at the University of California, Irvine. Their findings appeared in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

A team from UCI’s Center for Hydrometeorology & Remote Sensing examined data gathered from ground sensors and gauges during a 50-year period beginning in 1960. Applying a statistical analysis to the half-century data set, the researchers observed a significant increase in concurrent droughts and heat waves. For the purposes of the study, heat waves were defined as three to seven consecutive hot days, with temperatures in the 90th percentile of the historical record. Droughts were described as extended periods during which precipitation was 20 percent or less of the norm, as measured by the Standardized Precipitation Index.

While the researchers did not look into human-caused global climate change in this study, senior author Amir AghaKouchak, assistant professor of civil & environmental engineering said, an overall increase in the mean temperature worldwide is raising the probability of heat waves. He cited the recent record-breaking high in Iran: NASA satellites and National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration data sets documented a 115-degree Fahrenheit surface temperature – with a “comfort index” of 165 degrees – on July 31, 2015 in the city of Bandar-e Mahshahr. More than 2,500 people died during a heat wave that gripped India in May, 2015. A European heat wave in 2003 claimed about 70,000 victims, many of them seniors and children.

UCI graduate student and lead author Omid Mazdiyasni and AghaKouchak explain in the paper that while commonly used analysis methods do not show any trend in concurrent droughts and heat waves, a unique statistical approach called the Cramer-von Mises test reveals a statistically significant change in the simultaneous occurrence of these climate extremes.

""Southern California wildfires exhibit split personalities""
Wildfires have ravaged both populated and unpopulated regions of Southern California at an increasing rate over the past few decades, and scientists from three University of California campuses and partner institutions are predicting that by midcentury, as a consequence of climate change causing hotter and drier summers, a lot more will go up in flames.

In a paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the scientists discuss the split-personality nature of Southern California wildfires. They describe two distinct wildfire types – those driven by offshore Santa Ana winds that kick up in the fall and those that result primarily from hot, dry conditions in the summer. In terms of the amount of acreage consumed, the two fire types are roughly equal, but the Santa Ana fires, which tend to hit more developed areas, have been 10 times more costly over the period studied, 1990 to 2009. The researchers relied on NASA satellite data and decades’ worth of fire records from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the U.S. Forest Service.

Non-Santa Ana fires, by contrast, burn more slowly and tend to occur in more remote mountain areas. Non-Santa Ana fires, such as the Station Fire that scorched large portions of the Angeles National Forest in 2009, rely on hot temperatures and are more sensitive to the accumulation of woody debris and other dried out vegetation that serve as a fuel source. Both types of fires are costly and damaging, but the researchers see change on the horizon. 

The researchers said that firefighting agencies at the local, state, and national levels should begin now to prepare for a future with more wildfires in Southern California and the rest of the western United States. In fact, one issue the researchers point to is the potential for more regional competition in summer for firefighting resources – air tankers, vehicles, and personnel. The disproportionate impact of Santa Ana fires also has implications for optimizing resources. “The large economic and human impacts of Santa Ana fires raises the question of whether more resources during fall could be marshalled for suppressing these fires,” said James Randerson, Chancellor’s Professor of Earth system science at UCI and senior author on the paper.

""Scientists drill first deep ice core at the South Pole""
UCI and fellow researchers map climate history at the bottom of the Earth. A small group of glaciologists have been working in round-the-clock daylight and frigid temperatures drilling an ice core at the other end of the planet. Drilling continued through the end of January 2015 for the first of two years of a joint project by the UC Irvine and the University of Washington. The National Science Foundation is funding the South Pole Ice Core Project to dig into climate history at the planet’s southernmost tip.

The 40,000-year record will be the first deep core from this region of Antarctica, and the first record longer than 3,000 years collected south of 82 degrees latitude. Scientists were attracted by conditions at the pole, which are cold even by Antarctic standards. The location is just 1.7 miles from the South Pole. The thick, uncontaminated layers of ice there will help answer questions about how Antarctic climate interacts with the rest of the world. The period between 40,000 years ago and 10,000 years ago includes sudden swings in temperature, ending with warming at the end of the last ice age. The team collected a more than 2-mile ice core from West Antarctica, a five-year effort that ended in 2011. Analysis of that ice is ongoing at UCI, UW and many other labs nationwide.

""Greenland’s fjords are far deeper than previously thought, and glaciers will melt faster""
West Greenland's fjords are vastly deeper than rudimentary models have shown, allowing intruding ocean water to badly undercut glacier faces, which will raise sea levels around the world much faster than previously estimated, a UCI-led research team has found. Those are the findings of a UCI-led research team that battled rough waters and an onslaught of icebergs for three summers to map the remote channels for the first time. 

The results have been accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters and are now available online. “Measurements are challenging to obtain beneath hundreds of meters of seawater in poorly charted, ice-infested fjords,” writes lead author Eric Rignot, a UCI glaciologist with a secondary appointment at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He and co-authors Ian Fenty of JPL, Cilan Cai and Yun Xu of UCI, and Chris Kemp of TerraSond Ltd. obtained and analyzed around-the-clock measurements of the marine waters and their intersection with the coastal edge of Greenland’s ice sheet. They discovered that some glaciers are perched on giant earthen sills, protecting them from the punishing salt water – for now at least – while others are being severely eroded out of sight beneath the surface, meaning they could collapse and melt much sooner than expected. “Numerical ice sheet models do not take into account these interactions and, as a result, underestimate how fast the glaciers will respond to climate warming,” Rignot said.

",The institution incorporated both faculty and staff engaged in research at UC Merced. ,"UC Merced sits at the epicenter of converging world challenges in water, energy, food, and the environment. To meet these challenges, research by faculty and students addresses a wide array of complex issues that bear directly on the energy efficiency, conservation of natural resources, and environmental sustainability. From campus institutes and research groups to the new Merced Vernal Pools-Grasslands Reserve, scientists from a variety of disciplines focus on critical issues important to California and beyond:   
                                      
Faculty, researchers, and students in the Sierra Nevada Research Institute conduct research in the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada that examines natural resources, air, water and soil pollution, and climate change to answer basic questions that lead to improved environmental sustainability.    

The UC Merced Energy Research Institute conducts cross-disciplinary research that develops new and improved renewable and sustainable energy generation technologies, sets the standard for institutional energy efficiency and sustainable energy futures, educates the energy industry and the next generation of energy scholars and practitioners, and examines domestic and global energy policy.    

The UC Merced Center for Climate Communication analyzes and disseminates information to communicate climate and environmental information to the public. A current project evaluates language to develop a better understanding of how people speak and think about climate change, and the implications for policy-making.    
The Mountain Hydrology Research Group engages in collaborative research in the Sierra Nevada and other western mountains to study water and biogeochemical cycles in forested areas, above tree line, and in meadows, and streams.

The University of California Advanced Solar Technologies Institute (UC Solar) is a multi-campus research institute centered at UC Merced. Current UC Solar research areas includes developing state-of-the-art solar energy generation technologies and examining solar energy economics and policy.

Over a dozen research groups, centers and institutes at UC Merced are actively involved with sustainability research.

Milestones and Accomplishments    

Professor Teamrat Ghezzehei was funded by NSF-PIRE (Partnerships for International Research), which enables a partnership of U.S., Senegalese, and French researchers and students to examine how native shrubs of Africa’s Sahel region improve crop production by influencing soil moisture and soil microbial composition.        

Graduate student Christian Moe is the recent recipient of the Dan David Scholarship for Solar Energy Research, a prize that recognizes innovative, interdisciplinary research that cuts across traditional boundaries.        

Wells Fargo Bank provided a grant to help provide long-term solutions to some of the world’s greatest environmental challenges. Student teams will develop preliminary designs that focus on water, energy and food-related challenges in the Central Valley. According to Dean Dan Hirleman, “These are real projects with real effects targeted to the huge problems the Valley faces.”                    
         
An engineering capstone team of seniors tackled a complex real-world problem in Yosemite National Park where a vital communications link had been damaged by fire. The student team designed a solution concept that meets project standards of reliability. If the project is adopted, the PG&E line will be removed from the Mariposa Grove of Sequoias and this otherwise pristine natural area will revert to former wilderness conditions.        

The Mechatronics, Embedded Systems and Automation (MESA) Lab designs unmanned aerial vehicles that are used for such tasks as monitoring air quality in wildfires before humans are put in harm’s way; monitoring natural gas pipelines for leaks; and monitoring crop growth, soil health and moisture.    
                
Professor Alberto Cerpa was awarded a $550,000 CAREER NSF Award to recognize and sustain his work in the field of wireless sensor networks.             
                            
Professor Tom Harmon’s research group works on climate change as this relates to soil moisture, groundwater, wetlands and surface water quality. Professor Harmon was recently awarded grants to investigate climate-driven changes in hydrologic processes and risks to sustainable freshwater ecosystems.             
    
A recent five year, $5 million NSF grant is enabling SNRI and other researchers in the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (SSCZO) to continue addressing challenges to California’s water security and its link to the health of Sierra Nevada ecosystems. 
                                            
Professor Gerardo Diaz is designing and testing the next generation of solar-collecting units at UC Merced. With funding from the California Energy Commission, Professor Diaz and his students have built a solar water heater in which water flows through flat minichannels, or tubes made of aluminum with the coating applied directly to the tubes.

","""UC Riverside is the face of the future of the University of California.  As the fastest growing campus in the UC system, UCR is celebrated for its world-class faculty, its breadth and variety of research, and its high caliber of instruction.

In the past few years, UC Riverside has hired hundreds of new, outstanding faculty, increased the number and size of the graduate programs, established new programs, and invested in new research.  While continuing to emphasize our already world-renowned programs, we are also working innovatively across disciplinary boundaries.  Many of UCR's programs are becoming increasingly well known for the quality of research and their creativity and innovative approaches to their subject matter.

Growth means expanding infrastructure, from the arts to engineering.  In 2013 UC Riverside will welcome the inaugural class to the new School of Medicine, the first new state medical school in California for more than four decades.  Across campus a number of new buildings have been recently completed, others will soon be finished, and still others are scheduled for construction in the near future.  As a result, UCR's facilities are state-of-the-art and extraordinarily conductive to dynamic research.

Whatever your discipline, UC Riverside is an exciting and intellectually stimulating place to be.  And, as the most ethnically divers campus in the UC system, it has a deserved reputation for being open and welcoming.

UC Riverside has always been known for the quality of its teaching and the accessibility of its faculty.  The campus prides itself on the close collegial relations between graduate students and their mentors.

UCR's faculty strive to provide our graduate students with the basic academic training and to instruct them in the best professional practices in order to equip them in every way for success in their careers.""",,http://sustainability.ucr.edu/programs/academics.html,--

The information collected is a starting place, not a final or verified document. In fact, we are aware of additional sustainability work on campus that was not captured by this initial survey. We are working to verify the information gathered, and to refine the process of the survey. UC San Diego looks forward to improving our responses based on survey results over the next few years.

Going forward, the UCSD Campus Sustainability Manager and student interns will work with deans and associate deans, center directors, the VC for Research, and Sponsored Research to collate information on sustainability-related research across campus.","THE KEELING CURVE
Charles David Keeling and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego (SIO) began the discussion around climate change as a result of human interaction with nature in 1958. With a current annual expenditure approaching $200 million and a fleet of four research vessels plus the research platform FLIP, SIO encompasses physical, chemical, biological, geological, and geophysical studies of the oceans, earth, and atmosphere. SIO offers graduate and undergraduate educational programs in marine biology, oceanography, and earth sciences. These efforts ensure SIO remains at the forefront of the climate change discussion and all facets of sustainability research.

AEROSOLS
Current research being performed at SIO involves making measurements of atmospheric aerosol chemistry and developing and using new analytical methods for these measurements. Conventional analytical methods for analyzing aerosols involve isolating particles on filters with subsequent analysis performed in the laboratory. The processes often disturb the aerosol because the particles evaporate or react before analysis. To overcome these difficulties, we developed aerosol-time-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS). This represents the first analytical technique capable of providing the precise size and chemical composition of individual aerosol particles in real time. Some examples of aerosol systems currently being characterized in the laboratory using ATOFMS include suspended dust, sea salt, and a variety of combustion particles. Most recently, a much smaller ATOFMS has been developed and flown over Colorado, northern and southern California, and most recently the Caribbean. In regional and international studies, these instruments are being used to study the direct effect of aerosols on visibility, pollution levels, cloud formation, and the global radiation balance. Controlled laboratory studies assist in sorting out data obtained from atmospheric studies, which are complicated by the numerous chemical processes occurring at any time. The information obtained can generate new models for atmospheric processes which will be directly applicable in efforts to control ozone depletion, improve air quality, and develop an understanding of the impact of aerosols on global climate.

FORECASTING THE SPREAD OF EPIDEMICS
Social networks, as well as studies of behavior, evolution, politics, genetics, and big data, are emerging as rich areas of scholarship and science. Understanding social phenomena, and delving into the nature of human creativity, is increasingly important in a shrinking world. For example, by a deeper understanding of human social network structure, UC San Diego researchers and their colleagues at Harvard, created and proved a new method of forecasting epidemic outbreaks. This is basic research that has important implications for improving the health of our society.  Additionally, this same research has shown the same forecasting method works for the epidemic flow of online information as well.
",http://sustainability.ucsd.edu/,"Development of a Sustainability Research Inventory is in progress. 

Number of academic departments (or the equivalent) that include at least one faculty or staff member that conducts sustainability research: UC San Diego does not track this information. We are specifically aware of 36 departments; however, as you can see from the balance of our responses, there are undoubtedly many more that fit these criteria.

UC San Diego boasts over 3,357 faculty who are involved in research.  Of our faculty, over 1,700, are lead principal investigators with active funded grant awards that combined is more than $1 billion."
"University of California, Santa Barbara",2016-03-23,2016-03-23 16:12:42,mo@geog.ucsb.edu,2.0,Pursuing,215.0,992.0,73.0,156.0,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/256/6/470/2678/List%20of%20Researchers.pdf,Please see attached inventory.,"For the purposes of reporting to STARS, UCSB’s definition of research that relates to or has research applications/implications related to sustainability includes research which:

1) Seeks to better explain the dynamic functionality of and history of earth’s systems as they may affect humans;
2) Seeks to better explain the relationship between humans and the environment;
3) Seeks to better explain human impacts on the natural environment;
4) Seeks to better explain the effect of environmental issues on humans or society more broadly;
5) Explores and responds to the relationship between humans and the natural environment through art and culture; and/or
6) Develops innovative solutions through practice, technology, or artistic expression regarding an issue affecting the environment and our relationship to it.

The majority of research at UC Santa Barbara is foundational in nature. Due to this, we often needed to look at the potential applications or implications of the research to discern the connection to sustainability.   

We only included research that included an environmental component.  Research that only addressed social justice and economic aspects of sustainability were not included.

We did not include research focused on understanding how ecosystems or organisms function if there was no explicit connection to an environmental issue.  If the ecological research investigated issues of restoration, human impacts, remediation, etc. we did count it.

We included creative activities of fine arts and humanities faculty, as well as articles and publications.  We sought “substantial” projects, including both grant-funded projects and non-funded projects.  For publications and ongoing experiments, we included “in progress” work.  

Research that addressed cultural relationships with the natural environment was included. For example, we included research that addressed how the environment has been represented in literature over time, especially if the faculty linked the research to how this change in perception might have affected the way society treats the environment.

In some of the cases we looked at, the researcher had not been conducting research with the primary objective of solving a sustainable challenge, but a sustainability innovation occurred as a “side effect.”  For instance, the researcher might be developing a new technology with the goal of creating a faster computer chip.  If the innovation was also significantly more energy efficient than the current technology on the market, we counted it.  

Process for evaluating which research to include:
We developed an initial list of researchers that we thought might be conducting sustainability related research (see process for identifying researchers below.)  That list was divided amongst a group of student interns and sustainability staff.  Each person then reviewed material online about their researchers and contacted them for more information and eventual verification of the research description.  In cases in which the answer appeared obvious and where the researcher did not object to the description, these cases were not further evaluated. For those cases where the judgment was unclear, however, the intern/staff member assigned to that researcher would bring the case to the group of evaluators working on this area of STARS to be debated.  Any time a faculty member thought that their research was not related to sustainability, we did not include it, regardless of the intern's/staff member's opinion of its relation. This arose, for instance, with researchers that we believed worked on climate change, but who did not want to be listed as a “climate change” researcher for fear that this would make them appear biased in their research.

Who to include:
We included all researchers that are eligible to be a principal investigator on our campus.  This includes professional research staff, lecturers with security of employment, faculty, and several other categories.  We did not include graduate students who are not eligible to be a principal investigator because we did not feel that we could collect accurate data in a timely manner.

For a full description of who is included in the list of principal investigators, please see: http://www.research.ucsb.edu/spo/proposal-preparation/principal-investigator-eligibility/ 

For academic departments, we included all research units and centers, as well as traditional academic departments.

Process for identifying researchers: 
Since we have reported to STARS before, we started our process for identifying researchers this year by looking at our list of researchers from our previous submission and contacting them to verify and update current research. We also did a campus-wide survey of faculty and researchers and asked them directly if they did research related to sustainability. In the survey, we collected descriptions of their research. Most of the descriptions from the survey were too brief for us to include in the final report; however, we collected leads to follow up on. The Office of Research's website was also helpful because it included news articles and announcements of grants, awards, and recognition of faculty accomplishments. Departmental and faculty websites were also reviewed. Lastly, we contacted research unit and center directors and department chairs in order to verify that the list we had for that department or research center/unit was accurate and complete. This step was particularly helpful for ensuring we were including the appropriate non-faculty researchers who are eligible to be principal investigators.
",See the list above,http://www.sustainability.ucsb.edu/,"The following departments were not included in the count of departments because they do limited amounts of research: 
•	English as a Second Language
•	Military Science (ROTC)
•	Interdisciplinary Courses 
•	Interdisciplinary Studies 

We also did not include Global Peace and Security (PROGRAM) because there was so much overlap with the Global and International Studies Department.

For research units and centers, we made the following exceptions:
•	Social Science Survey Center/Benton Survey Research Laboratory - No longer exists
•	Institute for Crustal Studies, now Earth Research Institute (ERI) - ERI is counted
•	Institute for Computational Earth Systems Science, now Earth Research Institute - ERI is counted
•	Health Data Research Facility - Included in ISBER

Kroeker is interested in how the rapidly accelerating changes in our environment will alter the fundamental ways that marine ecosystems work in the future. With the Packard funding, Kroeker plans to conduct large-scale studies of marine ecosystems to understand how these global changes will affect not only individual species but complex assemblages of multiple species. She noted that various environmental changes can have different and sometimes opposing patterns of occurrence and effects on species, yet they are often studied in isolation. ""While many species are already responding to warming trends by shifting into cooler climates, ocean acidification is progressing most rapidly in these cooler environments,"" she said. http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/kroeker-packard.html?utm_source=10-20 2015&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday (2015)

Barry Sinervo ecosystem climate impacts: UC Santa Cruz researchers have developed an ambitious plan to use the UC Natural Reserve System (NRS) to detect and forecast the ecological impacts of climate change in California. Their proposal to establish a UC-wide Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts (ISEECI) has received $1.9 million in funding, the largest of the new President's Research Catalyst Awards announced by UC President Janet Napolitano on December 10. UC Santa Cruz biologist Barry Sinervo will lead the institute, which involves all of UC's nine undergraduate campuses. The NRS is the world's largest system of university-administered natural reserves, offering a powerful opportunity for scientists to study how climate change will affect California ecosystems and the ecosystem services that people rely on. (2015)

Erica Zavaleta conservation scholars program: A UC Santa Cruz program to nurture a diverse cadre of environmental conservation leaders will receive $2 million over four years from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, joining four other universities in the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program. “The conservation field needs greater diversity to become even more successful,” said Erika Zavaleta, UC Santa Cruz professor of environmental studies who conceived of the UCSC-based version of the conservation scholars program. UCSC will use its long-established strengths in conservation, experiential learning, and educating first-generation college students and students of color as it recruits 20 exceptional students nationally each year over four years for intensive hands-on field experiences. http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/conservation-scholars.html (2015)

Coastal Sustainability graduate program: UC Santa Cruz has received a $560,000 grant from Wells Fargo to develop and launch a new coastal sustainability graduate program and fund coastal sustainability graduate fellowships. The new two-year master's degree program in environmental science and management is expected to launch in fall 2017. The program will train students to take a solutions-based approach to social and ecological challenges in the coastal zone, where climate change is increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems that provide natural resources and services to dense human populations and productive economies. http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/coastal-sustainability.html (2015)

A research team led by Yat Li, associate professor of chemistry at the University of California, Santa Cruz, developed the solar-microbial device that uses only sunlight and wastewater to produce hydrogen gas could provide a sustainable energy source while improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment. http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/10/solar-microbial-device.html (2013)

Led by Greg Rau, a senior scientist in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and a visiting scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), developed a new technique to remove and store atmospheric carbon dioxide while generating carbon-negative hydrogen and producing alkalinity, which can be used to offset ocean acidification. The system uses the acidity normally produced in saline water electrolysis to accelerate silicate mineral dissolution while producing hydrogen fuel and other gases. The resulting electrolyte solution was shown to be significantly elevated in hydroxide concentration, and it strongly absorbed and retained atmospheric carbon dioxide. The researchers suggest that the carbonate and bicarbonate produced in the process could be used to mitigate ongoing ocean acidification, similar to how antacids neutralize excess acid in the stomach. http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/05/carbon-capture.html (2013)

UC Santa Cruz researchers evaluate groundwater supply and management- Ruth Langridge, a UC Santa Cruz researcher with the Center for Global, International and Regional Studies, created a report for the State Water Resources Control board reviewing the history, development, overall condition and current management practices for all of California’s court-adjudicated groundwater basins. The research team that created the report also includes UC Santa Cruz sociology Ph.D. students Abigail Brown and Kirsten Rudestam, and Esther Conrad, a recent Ph.D. graduate of UC Berkeley. Court adjudication of California's groundwater basins is more often focused on resolving conflicts among water users and less on sustainable groundwater management, according to a UC Santa Cruz study commissioned by the State Water Resources Control Board. The finding comes in “An Evaluation of California’s Adjudicated Groundwater Basins.""

CASFS researcher Mark Lipson wins sustainability champion award- The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC) has given its “Sustainability Champion” award to UC Santa Cruz alumnus Mark Lipson, currently a researcher with UCSC’s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.Lipson (Merrill, ‘81, environmental studies) served as organic and sustainable agriculture policy advisor for the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture until last year when he joined CASFS as a research associate.  NSAC said the award, given at its annual meeting in Davis, was made to honor Lipson’s years of service to the organic and sustainable agriculture movement, and his “groundbreaking work on Capitol Hill shepherding historic changes, such as the much-celebrated five-fold increase in funding for organic research secured in the 2008 Farm Bill.” http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/lipson-award.html

The OSP provided us a list of all the PIs and Co-PIs who are faculty at UConn. The Office of Environmental Policy (OEP) reviewed the project titles to confirm that the projects are related to sustainability.  The OSP also provided a list of all researchers listed on externally funded grants, which the OEP reviewed in order to remove any non-UConn faculty. The OEP also added faculty listed by the OSP for externally-funded research during the past year, and for which we had personal knowledge were engaged in sustainability-related funded research, but which had been omitted from OSP's key word search list for sustainability.","Dr. Alexander G. Agrios, Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is researching environmental applications of nanoscale semiconductors, especially in low-cost solar energy conversion. The lab is developing different nanoarchitectures to take advantage of fast electron transport, high surface area, and dye compatibility of the TiO2 nanoparticles. They are also introducing a dye-anchored nanocatalyst in solar cells to absorb more light and increase energy conversion efficiency of low-cost dye-sensitized solar cells.

Carol Atkinson-Palombo, Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography, worked with Ben Hoen, Staff Research Assistant at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on a report that determined that wind turbines have zero negative effects on nearby property values and home sales. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center. The study examined over 100,00 home sales between 1998 and 2012 occurring within five miles of the current or future location of 41 wind turbines.

However, we believe the data as compiled for the Princeton Review snapshot is incomplete.  We were able to identify both inadvertent omissions and inclusions, which we have endeavored to correct.

These numbers are only of research faculty who have externally funded research, excluding staff and excluding faculty other than PIs and co-PIs (also excluding faculty conducting research that is not externally-funded).

Then, the office staff searched the institution's website for additional sustainability research projects and compiled a list of possible projects for each college (based off of what was found on each department's webpage and the existing list). 

Each college was contacted individually to review the possible sustainability research projects that the team identified. Specifically, the staff in the Office contacted the dean, department chairs and the already identified faculty engaged in sustainability research or curriculum. Some colleges and departments appointed a liaison to review the research list, sent back the confirmed projects and added any additional projects that the Office staff missed. Other colleges and departments had individuals contact the Office staff directly regarding their specific sustainability research projects. (Departments were also contacted about sustainability courses during this process to avoid overlap since many faculty who teach in sustainability also conduct sustainability research.)

After receiving responses from the colleges and departments, the Office of Sustainability staff compiled all of the feedback to create the complete sustainability research inventory. If a specific project was not confirmed by the dean, department chair or faculty member, the Office of Sustainability staff reviewed the project again and decided whether or not the research project could be considered sustainability research based off of the project description. 

The Office staff then met with the Division of Research and decided to only include ranked faculty (rather than also including lecturers, adjunct faculty and staff) for the total researchers count. A complete list of university researchers is not readily available and almost all ranked faculty are required to conduct research. Finally, the Division of Research pulled a list of grants from the university's research database based off of a list of sustainability keywords that the Office staff suggested. All of this information was compiled to produce the final research inventory.

The GA is collected lists of publications and citations from various research centers and academic departments and used the Earth Charter principles to categorize research by department. The inventory was completed in March 2015.,"1) Dr. Herman Daly, professor emeritus of public policy, won the Blue Planet Prize (sometimes called the ""Environmental Nobel"") for his redefinition of ""steady state economics"" that incorporates the environment, local communities, quality of life and ethics. His research contributes to building a foundation of economics that will help solve global environmental problems.

2) The U.S. Department of Energy has provided $5 million in funding to the University of Maryland, Redox Power Systems LLC, Microsoft Corp. and Trans-Tech Inc. to develop fuel cells that run on natural gas. Fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy more efficiently and with less greenhouse gas emissions than other forms of energy generation. The project goal is to develop an affordable, efficient, market-ready fuel cell. Redox CEO Warren Citrin and Professor Eric Wachsman, director of the UMD Energy Research Center, have helped lead this research.

3) Melissa Kenney, environmental decision scientist and research assistant professor at the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, was a lead author in the third National Climate Assessment. The assessment, one in the federal government's series of reports to address climate change and climate science, was released May 7, 2014. Her section focuses on decision frameworks: how risk management and acclimation help create policies to address climate change.

4)Stephanie Lansing, assistant professor of environmental science and technology; Steve Hutcheson, professor of cell biology and molecular genetics; and Rock Kohn, professor of animal science, received a $20,000 grant from the university's Sustainability Fund to develop a small-scale anaerobic digester, which will test the conversion of organic waste into energy. The goal is to convert dining hall waste into biogas, a substitute for natural gas. UMD currently burns natural gas, so finding a replacement fuel would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

5) Dr. Paul Leisnham, assistant professor in the Department of 
Environmental Science and Technology, is serving as the lead for a 
University of Maryland research team that was recently awarded a 
competitive grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for an 
innovative proposal designed to help local communities tackle stormwater
 and reduce pollution to the Chesapeake Bay. The research team includes 
research faculty and graduate students from the School of Agriculture 
and Natural Resources, University of Maryland Extension, the School of 
Public Health, and the A. James Clark School of Engineering.

6) Dr. George Hurtt, Director of Research and Professor in the

We gathered data on faculty, departments, and research projects that focus on or relate to the topic of sustainability.  We reviewed every research proposal submitted to a funding agency to identify faculty and staff engaged in sustainability research.  We also reviewed the University's research database to identify sustainability-related projects.  The output is a comprehensive inventory of our faculty and staff engaged in sustainability research.","Energy Extension Initiative
Funded by a $6 million grant from the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, the UMass Amherst Energy Extension Initiative promotes adoption of renewable energy technology and energy efficiency activities across the state. Approximately $4 million of this grant supports development of an energy outreach and extension-type program on campus that draws on UMass Amherst experts to help provide assistance and solutions to regional clean energy initiatives.

New England Water Innovation Network
A $4.1 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has funded UMass Amherst research in water treatment innovation, focusing on the development of healthier and more effective alternatives to chlorine for disinfecting in U.S. water treatment facilities. This is also a research and extension-type service that provides faculty expertise to regional and national water treatment problems.

Smart Meter Data Analysis
18,000 smart meters have been deployed in western Massachusetts by computer science faculty and students working in conjunction with a local energy company, providing real time data on consumer electricity usage. This information yields patterns—peak usage times, appliance usage, and more—that are invaluable in making buildings more efficient. The data will feed several sub-projects already underway, including an automated thermostat, that uses building-specific data to make customized usage recommendations and implement such simple yet effective changes as automatically adjusting the thermostat when no one is home.

Northeast Climate Center Grants
UMass Amherst was selected by the U.S. Department of the Interior as host for the Northeast Climate Science Center. Since its inception in 2012, the NECSC has awarded more than $700,000 in grants to universities and other partners for research to guide managers of parks, refuges and other cultural and natural resources in planning how to help species and ecosystems adapt to climate change. The six studies funded include the impact on wildlife due to changes in snowpack and lake ice in the Great Lakes Basin, information management needs for the floodplain conservation lands of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and the development of distribution models for North American breeding birds showing the impact of climate change in order to identify the most vulnerable species and regions.

Sustainable Manufacturing Through Nanotech
A team of scientists have developed a breakthrough technique for controlling molecular assembly of nanoparticles over multiple length scales that should allow faster, cheaper, more ecologically friendly manufacture of organic photovoltaics and other electronic devices. The new techniques successfully address two major goals for device manufacture: controlling molecular assembly and avoiding toxic solvents like chlorobenzene. While being currently used to produce organic photovoltaics and solar cells, this technique has many applications, offering a flexible and ecologically friendly new approach to manufacturing.",http://www.umass.edu/researchnext/,--

Science Express represents a collection of research projects that investigate the potential of Out-of-Home-Media (OHM) to foster informal science learning. The investigators have chosen to focus the model of engagement on climate change. Climate Change represents a timely and relevant example for which to identify the strengths and weakness of using OHM to foster science learning.  This work led to a $2.2 million public education campaign on global climate change,  Professor David Lustick was recognized by the Obama administration as a ""champion of change” and was invited to an event in Washington featuring honorees who are ""doing extraordinary work to enhance climate education and literacy in classrooms and communities across the country.""  http://www.lowellsun.com/news/ci_27535600/uml-professors-work-climate-change-honored

2. WindSTAR - WindSTAR is an NSF-funded Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Wind Energy, Science, Technology and Research.  A collaboration between UMass Lowell, the University of Texas at Dallas, Iowa State University, Southern Maine Community College, the Maine Wind Industry Alliance, and Kid Wind, the center aims to solve the pressing needs of the wind industry.  The partners work together on research and education in areas including composites, foundations, towers, manufacturing and design, structural-health monitoring, non-destructive inspection and testing, control systems, energy storage, offshore wind-energy operations and wind-system planning, siting, operations and maintenance.  The Center Director for UMass Lowell is Christopher Niezrecki, Ph.D. of the Mechanical Engineering Department.

","Global Landscapes Initiative Finds Methods to Improve Environment and Food Security
 - At the Institute on the Environment, the Global Landscapes Initiative (GLI) conducts research in agriculture, which has a greater environmental impact by far than any other human endeavor, using about 40% of the terrestrial land surface and emitting nearly a third of all greenhouse gases. GLI publishes in leading publications including Science, Nature Communications, and BioScience. The paper ""Leverage points for improving food security and the environment,"" in Science, was covered by 60-70 media outlets--including the Guardian, Newsweek, NPR, National Geographic, and FastCompany.  This paper focused on regions, crops, and commodities where interventions to decrease the environmental impact of agriculture can have the greatest effect. GLI work in sustainability gets results out of academic journals and into the hands of practitioners who can effect change on the ground. This occurs through work with corporate partners in agriculture-focused and agriculture-dependent companies to help them achieve effective sustainability commitments and programs.  GLI has recently met with companies such as General Mills, Bunge, Coca-Cola, and Unilever. GLI also presents work at high-profile conferences and workshops, such as American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Brasilian Congress of AgroMeterology, and Colombia’s Expogestión Orinoquía.

Bacteria tapped for eco-friendly industrial cleanup
-Now, a collection of scientists and business experts at the University of Minnesota are developing new methods of remediation — the act of removing pollutants from the environment. The researchers are developing software that models how enzymes break down chemicals at the microscopic level to optimize the selection of bacteria that biodegrade those chemicals. Meanwhile, business experts are conducting market research to discover the best ways to apply this new knowledge and learn how it can lead to viable industrial processes and products.

Startup takes aim at invasive carp threat in Minnesota lakes
-The common carp, an invasive species now prevalent in Minnesota, has been a destructive force in the state’s many lakes since it was first introduced about a hundred years ago.
Now, a University of Minnesota startup is bringing a new approach to bear in the fight against common carp. Carp Solutions, which launched in February, uses the results from U research conducted over the past decade to provide a comprehensive assessment of carp populations and recommend methods for how best to limit their populations in bodies of water across the state. The company is led by Przemyslaw Bajer, Ph.D., assistant professor of fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology with the U’s College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, who has been conducting carp research in Minnesota since 2006.

Research supercharges rice to meet growing demand
Through a consortium effort, the Center for Genome Engineering Research engineered rice to use a form of super-efficient photosynthesis — the process that lets plants draw energy from sunlight — in addition to its normal, less efficient version. This form, called C4 photosynthesis,  boosts plant growth by better capturing and concentrating carbon dioxide in the leaves’ cells.

Urban Heat Islands
Some parts of the Twin Cities can spike temperatures up to 9° F higher than surrounding communities thanks to the “urban heat island” effect, according to a new study from the University of Minnesota. The study, which was funded by the Institute on the Environment and published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, used a network of 180 sensors deployed throughout the Twin Cities metropolitan area in residential backyards and city parks to paint the most detailed picture anywhere in the world of how temperature varies with time and place across pavement-filled metropolitan areas and surrounding communities. “We’ve long known that heat radiated by buildings, roads, bridges and other structures keeps surface air temperature higher in cities than in surrounding areas. However, temperature is officially measured at just a few locations in most cities, so awareness of the extent and variability of urban heat island effects was limited,” said lead author Brian Smoliak. “Our study highlights the usefulness of dense sensor networks for urban weather and climate research with practical implications for human health, energy consumption, and environmental quality.”",http://environment.umn.edu/research-solutions/,--

There are 3,608 TOTAL Faculty. There are 962 faculty within this list with “Clinical” modifiers in their rank (“Clinical Assistant Professor,” “Clinical Associate Professor,” “Clinical Instructor,” and “Clinical Professor”). Most of these faculty members are associated with UNC Health Affairs and focus more on practice (for example, seeing patients). These faculty were removed from the total list of researchers and were not counted as part of the “Total Faculty,” therefore decreasing the TOTAL FACULTY count to 2,646. All other faculty titles and ranks were retained in determining the Total Faculty count.

A keyword search was then conducted in the UNC Research Administration Management System & eSubmission (RAMSseS) Database. The Sustainability Office, with guidance from the Sustainability Advisory Committee, compiled a list of sustainability-related keywords to use for identifying sustainability-related research and courses. These keywords were used to identify principle investigators (PIs/faculty) who submitted proposals to conduct sustainability-related research. This keyword search limited results to faculty who held appointments within the last three fiscal years (FY11, FY12, and FY13).

Keyword results from RAMSeS were then matched to the OIRA faculty list. The keyword lists served as a guide for identifying faculty conducting sustainability-related research. Further investigation helped describe research activities and contributions to or collaborations with Centers and Labs. 

There are 428 faculty who conduct research related to sustainability, out of 2,646 total faculty, or 16.2%. 

There are three specific faculty members who hold “Clinical” designations, but are professors of the practice and conduct research related to sustainability. These three faculty members are: Greg Gangi, Institute for the Environment, and Carol Hee and Ted Zoller, Kenan-Flagler Business School. These three faculty are designated with an asterisk in the attached spreadsheet. Their omission would be a major oversight. Adding these three researchers back to the list, and also to the total faculty count,  results in 431 faculty who conduct sustainability-related research, out of 2,649 total faculty, or 16.3%.

To determine the number of departments that include faculty who conduct sustainability-related research, the list of sustainability-related researchers was compared to the original list of 3,608 total faculty from OIRA. The OIRA list includes a “Department” field for all faculty. The list includes faculty representing 93 different departments. This list includes departments with “Clinical” faculty. Of these total departments, 70 departments have faculty who conduct sustainability-related research, or 75.2%.

That provided our baseline for academic departments and faculty involved in research.  But because funding tracked by UNCG does not capture what is sustainability or not, we relied on our own survey of websites and a poll of faculty to see who has done research in sustainability.  We also relied on some data from previous such surveys/polls and double checked that faculty were still active in research relevant to sustainability.  Those further surveys netted 0 further departments and 2 further faculty involved in research (all sustainability research), not significantly altering our reliance on the ORED data.  Because UNCG is a school that also promotes teaching and community engagement, many departments and faculty may choose to follow those paths; therefore, we have relied on the ORED data with our survey supplement to capture the research component, but it is necessarily limited in the data it provides.  Without completing one-on-one surveys of every faculty member, it is impossible to garner adequate data.  If anything, the numbers here may over-represent the quantity of sustainability research at UNCG.","Dr. Aaron S. Allen, associate professor of musicology and UNCG Academic Sustainability Coordinator, participated in a parallel plenary entitled ""Sustainability and Sound"" at the AASHE 2013 national meeting in Nashville.  He also ran a post-conference workshop on ecomusicology at AASHE 2014 meeting in Portland.

Dr. Karen Kilcup, professor of English, published the book ""Fallen Forests: Emotion, Embodiment, and Ethics in American Women’s Environmental Writing, 1781-1924,"" which considers  how these writers anticipated contemporary environmental concerns, ranging from resource depletion and resource wars to voluntary simplicity and environmental justice.

Dr. Catherine Matthews, professor of education, collaborated with biology lecturer Ms. Ann Somers on the HERP project (Herpetology Education in Rural Places), a multi-million dollar NSF grant.  

Dr. William Markham, professor of sociology and director of the UNCG Environmental Studies Program, published the book ""Environmental Organizations in Modern Germany: Hardy Survivors in the Twentieth Century and Beyond.""

",The University created a Sustainability Task Force whose mission has been to inventory current faculty engaged in sustainability research as well as provide opportunities for additional faculty to develop sustainability related research.,"1.Paul W. Leu, PhD, assistant professor of industrial engineering at the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering, received the National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award for his work on flexible metals.  The CAREER program is the National Science Foundation’s most prestigious award for junior faculty who exemplify outstanding research, teaching, and their integration.   The five-year, $500,000 award will support research into the manipulation of metals at the micro- and nanoscale to develop thin yet flexible crystalline silicon for high efficiency, low cost solar cells.   The grant will help develop a Google Streetview-like virtual tour of the limited access cleanroom, so web visitors from around the world can see and learn about the facility.  Additionally, the grant will enable the development of a new graduate course in Statistical Design of Materials and undergraduate research opportunities through Pitt’s Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation. 

2. Dr. Emily Elliott received an NSF CAREER award for her proposal ""Air-ecosystem-water interactions of reactive nitrogen in urban systems"" from the Hydrologic Sciences directorate.  Her research program examines  the tight coupling between human activities and reactive nitrogen  distributions in atmospheric, terrestrial and hydrologic systems at multiple spatial scales using stable isotope biogeochemistry.   These coupled relationships are being investigated in agricultural, energy production, transportation, and  human-built environments to determine how best to manage inputs of reactive nitrogen to protect water quality, air quality, ecosystem and human health.  

3. Thanks to the preliminary results from MCSI sponsored research seed grants a team of faculty received a $297,047 NSF grant to prepare students to develop the next generation of solar cells.   Engaging engineering students in the development of low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells through innovative instruction is the focus of the grant awarded to Paul W. Leu, assistant professor of industrial engineering; Guangyong Li, assistant professor of electrical engineering; Jung-kun Lee, assistant professor of materials science; and Sam Spiegel,  chair of the Disciplinary Literacy in Science team and associate director of outreach and development of the Engineering Education Research Center.  The second awarded to Dr. Leu is a $296,593 NSF grant to study nanosphere coatings on silicon thin film photovoltaics.  This project will also educate and outreach to next-generation engineers through open source software development, the introduction of various education modules, and involvement with the Pitt Office of Diversity's INVESTING NOW summer program. 

4. Dr. Lisa Weiland, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science recently received a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant and was approved for an entrepreneurial leave from the University of Pittsburgh in order to advance her hydrokenetic energy harvesting technology and start her new company 1st Principles Engineering.  Dr. Weiland’s early sustainability work was funded through MCSI seed grant research.

When questions arose, contact was made with faculty to learn more about their specific sustainability-related research.","David Salisbury received a grant entitled ""Building Conservation Capacity in a Changing Amazonia"" from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the American Council for Education’s (ACE), and Higher Education for Development (HED) in 2013. The 2.5 year grant is to support efforts to assist a Peruvian Amazonian university, Universidad Nacional de Ucayali, to better prepare students and faculty to improve biodiversity conservation and sustainability in the Amazon rainforest.

David Kitchen published a text book ""Global Climate Change: Turning Knowledge into Action"" with Prentice Hall.

Stephen Nash published ""Virginia Climate Fever: How Global Warming will Tranform our Cities, Shorelines, and Forests"" with University of Virginia Press.

A symposium on how to protect Virginia's wildlife and natural wealth such as forests and wetlands from the threat of climate change was held by Environmental Studies students (organized by professors Peter Smallwood and Steve Nash). The symposium was followed by a meeting of the Virginia Governor's Climate and Resiliency Commission. 

Several Living-Learning communities were created including several as part of our Sophmore Scholars in Residence program (e.g., Local to Global (L2G); Geography of the James River Watershed; Protected Lands of the West; Eating Locally, Thinking Globally).

The Parking Lot Project was part of our Tucker-Boatwright Festival, and it transformed a University of Richmond parking lot into a yearlong, collaborative artwork, driven by students from diverse disciplines enrolled in a course through the Department of Art and Art History. The spring section was cross-listed with the Department of Geography and the Environment. Additional spaces were transformed by select students, faculty, and staff from across the University (http://as.richmond.edu/tucker-boatwright/past-events/project.html).

The acting chief of the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) discussed “Making Climate Change Research More Relevant to Natural Resource Management”.

The River City Project continued to integrate sustainability across the curriculum at the university. This two day workshop introduced faculty and staff to core concepts of sustainability including the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability with the goal of linking these ideas to a course they teach.

In May, 2015, the University of Richmond came together during a day-long symposium to discuss a vision and strategy for sustainability education and research activities at the University as part of the symposium ""Mapping UR's Sustainability Future: Crafting a Vision for Sustainability Teaching, Learning, and Research."" 75 people from 37 separate departments and offices, including senior members of the administrative staff, attended. Two national leaders in sustainability in higher education joined the conference as panelists, facilitators, and advisors. Angela Halfacre from Furman University and Neil Leary from Dickinson College offered their expertise and experience as directors of academic centers focused on sustainability.

3) George Philippidis (Patel College of Global Sustainability) directs the development, scale-up, and commercialization of biomass and algae technologies for sustainable production of transportation fuels, renewable power, and value-added chemicals; Dr. Philippidis: ""Here at USF, the Biofuels and Bioproducts Lab focuses on the development of biofuels and bioproducts from two sustainable sources, algae and biomass. Our work involves developing the technologies needed to convert biomass (anything green), algae, and vegetable oils into fuels, products, and electricity."" http://www.usf.edu/pcgs/initiatives/tampa-bay-taps-into-renewable-energy-biomass-algae.aspx 

4) The USF Muma College of Business has a growing focus in supply chain management, reverse logistics, and sustainability.  Supply chain management, reverse logistics, and sustainability greatly interest both domestic and international businesses because these issues impact their profitability — especially in today's competitive marketplace. To that end, the USF Muma College of Business has created the Center for Supply Chain Management & Sustainability at USF, the first center of its kind in Florida.  The center will employ globally recognized faculty to teach undergraduate and graduate students — as well as corporate clients — on these issues. The curriculum and training provided by the center will seek to increase the number of supply chain management professionals across industry segments. http://www.usf.edu/business/centers/supply-chain-sustainability/index.aspx

This list was then reviewed and sustainability-related projects were identified.,"Dr. Craig Willis is an Associate Professor in Biology studying the ecology, behaviour, and physiology of wild mammals. He and his students conduct research about mammalian ecology and evolution, as well as applied conservation research that is important for understanding the impacts of climate change, industrial development, and habitat loss on wildlife. Recently the Willis lab has been part of the major international effort to understand a disease called White Nose Syndrome (WNS). WNS was discovered in 2006; it has spread rapidly throughout eastern North America and recently into Ontario and Quebec. The disease is named for a white fungus (called Geomyces destructans) which grows on the exposed skin of the muzzles and wings of the bats. Little brown bats, one of the most common North American species, are the hardest hit. Current estimates predict local extinction for this species within 20 years of the arrival of WNS in an area. This is a crisis for bat conservation but also has wider consequences for ecosystems, forestry, and agriculture, given the role of bats as the primary consumers of night-flying insects. Recent estimates suggest that bats are worth billions of dollars annually for North American agriculture because of reduced crop damage and pesticide costs. Dr. Willis and his collaborators have recently received nearly US $400,000 over two years from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These funds will support field and laboratory studies  to better understand precisely how Geomyces destructans is killing bats and to determine the potential for natural selection to help bat populations rebound from WNS in the future. Also involved in the research are Dr. Jens Franck from Biology at the UWinnipeg, two post-doctoral fellows in Dr. Willis’ group, Dr. Lisa Warnecke and Dr. James Turner, and international collaborators from Europe and the U.S.

Dr. Shailesh Shukla's (Indigenous Studies) teaching and research interests range widely from indigenous knowledge systems, indigenous and traditional foods, food sovereignty, ethnoecology, participatory governance, community-based conservation, intergenerational transmission and learning within indigenous knowledge systems, critical social science and mixed research methods including indigenous worldviews, indigenous development and community-based development and resources management.  He has collaborated with academic and research partners from Canada and South Asia on research projects on indigenous knowledge systems and community-based resources management funded by SSHRC, Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute, and IDRC Canada.  He is now serving as co-Principal Investigator (2011-2014) and thematic leader for the Indigenous Knowledge component of an international interdisciplinary research project that involves three Canadian universities (MSC CMU, UM, Guelph) and multiple partners in South Asia (India, Nepal and Sri Lanka).  The project is funded by the IDRC, Canada through its newly established funds on global food security. He also served as a consultant for International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), FAO (Food and Agriculture Organizations) and European Commission. He has recently completed Shastri-Institute funded international action-research project on exploring the value of traditional foods and wild crops in enhancing community food security in two indigenous communities – Juang from Odisha, India and Fisher River Cree Nations, Manitoba. His key geographic interest and experience is South Asia (India, Nepal and Sri Lanka) and Manitoba, Canada. His scholarly works appeared as Edited Book chapters and in journals such as Human Ecology, Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine and Ethnobotany research and Application. He is also an International advisory committee member for the Biodiversity Watch Journal and peer reviewer for Human Ecology, Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine and Environment Management. He is co-editor (with Drs. R. N. Pati and Laurence Chanza) of Indigenous knowledge and Biodiversity (Sarup Book Publishers, 2014). He has presented and published research papers on indigenous knowledge systems, particularly traditional medicinal plant knowledge, food security in indigenous contexts, participatory research methods, community-based conservation, environmental education, sustainable agriculture and educational innovations. In an effort to strengthen Indigenous Science stream, Dr. Shukla has developed and taught new courses at University of Winnipeg including Ethnoecology, Indigenous Food Security, and Field course on Ethnobotany.

Dr. Ian Mauro (Geography) is a renowned academic and filmmaker whose projects focus on food security, sustainable agriculture and climate change. He co-directed the influential Inuktitut language film Qapirangajuq: Inuit Knowledge and Climate Change with Zacharias Kunuk, the acclaimed Inuk filmmaker who made Atanarjuat The Fast Runner. Mauro’s films have been translated into numerous languages and screened globally at academic conferences, film festivals and venues such as the United Nations, Smithsonian Institution, National Geographic and the Royal Ontario Museum. In his latest research documentary, Climate Change in Atlantic Canada, Mauro explores the impacts of extreme weather on coastal communities and local-level approaches to mitigation and adaptation. He recently toured the film across Atlantic Canada with David Suzuki, award-winning scientist and broadcaster, as a fundraiser for environmental groups in the region. Mauro is known to use participatory video to collect digital stories to help communicate and conserve local and indigenous knowledge. This approach allows people who live on the land to tell their own stories, in their own language, and within the landscapes where their knowledge has been generated. He was awarded an “Apple Distinguished Educator” award for his approach in 2011. Given Mauro’s diverse background – dealing with climate science, food security, energy issues, environmental management, community engagement and indigenous knowledge – he has been asked to serve a number of expert panels.

Solar research focuses on one of the “holy-grails” of 21st Century chemistry – the efficient and economical conversion of solar energy into stored chemical fuel. CCI Solar investigators are targeting the critical science underpinning the solar-driven decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. The technological, environmental, economic, and social benefits of renewable solar fuels cannot be overstated: every human being on Earth would be impacted by the development of sustainable energy resources. The CCI Solar research team is actively engaged to bring this goal to fruition. http://www.ccisolar.caltech.edu/

2) UWO Professor Stephanie Spehar, PI: The Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) population has declined over 50% during the last 60 years, encounter rates of wild orangutans have decreased six fold, and most scientists estimate fewer than 50,000 individuals survive in the wild. This sharp decline has occurred almost entirely due to human activities and development and is projected to continue into the future. In order to preserve wild orangutan populations, reliable and inexpensive methods are needed for estimating population size and monitoring populations, but such methods are lacking. Furthermore, since the majority of wild populations (~ 75%) are located outside of protected areas, it is imperative to work with local communities and governments to build sustainable policies for management of forest resources. http://www.integratedconservation.org/page/orangutans",--,--

","1.	Members of Vanderbilt faculty helped research and develop the first Sustainable Tennessee report entitled SUSTAINING TENNESSEE IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE: GRAND CHALLENGES AND GREAT OPPORTUNITIES, available at: http://www.eenews.net/assets/2012/09/13/document_cw_01.pdf Contributing authors from Vanderbilt include Mark Abkowitz, Janey Camp, Jonathan Gilligan, and Alfredo Vergara.
2.	A Vanderbilt engineering team, comprised of five engineering seniors with two faculty mentors, Dr. Kane Jennings, Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Dr. Amrutur Anilkumar, Professor of the Practice of Mechanical Engineering, designed a biohybrid solar panel that substitutes a protein from spinach for expensive silicon wafers that are energy intensive to produce, and is capable of producing electricity. The team won a Phase II $90,000 grant at the 8th Annual National Sustainable Design Expo held at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The Expo – co-sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – featured 44 university and college teams competing for Phase II funding under the EPA’s People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) student design competition. A miniature bio-cell can produce minute electricity from Photosystem I (PSI), the protein in plant chloroplasts that converts light to electrochemical energy. The team extracted PSI from spinach and used it as the working medium in the bio-photovoltaic cells. The two scaled-up panels consist of 24 cells connected in series with each cell measuring 75 x 38 mm. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/2012/09/spinach-power-gets-a-major-boost/  
3.	When white-light quantum dots were discovered accidentally in a Vanderbilt chemistry lab, their efficiency was too low for commercial applications and several experts predicted that it would be impossible to raise it to practical levels. In 2012, however, Vanderbilt researchers proved those predictions wrong by reporting that they successfully boosted the fluorescent efficiency of these nanocrystals from an original level of three percent to as high as 45 percent. Dr. Sandra Rosenthal, Jack and Pamela Egan Chair of Chemistry, directed the research which is described online in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The general measure for the overall efficiency of lighting devices is called luminous efficiency and it measures the amount of visible light (lumens) a device produces per watt. An incandescent light bulb produces about 15 lumens/watt, while a fluorescent tube puts out about 100 lumens/watt. White light LEDs currently on the market range from 28 to 93 lumens/watt. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/2012/05/vanderbilt-research-brightens-the-future-of-lighting/ 
4.	In 2013, Cary Pint, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering, created the first supercapacitor that is made out of silicon so it can be built into a silicon chip along with the microelectronic circuitry that it powers. In fact, it should be possible to construct these power cells out of the excess silicon that exists in the current generation of solar cells, sensors, mobile phones and a variety of other electromechanical devices, providing a considerable cost savings. Instead of storing energy in chemical reactions the way batteries do, “supercaps” store electricity by assembling ions on the surface of a porous material. As a result, they tend to charge and discharge in minutes, instead of hours, and operate for a few million cycles, instead of a few thousand cycles like batteries. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/2013/11/new-device-stores-electricity-on-silicon-chips/ 
5.	Rizia Bardhan, one of Vanderbilt’s newest assistant professors and one of Forbes’ “30 Under 30 in Science & Innovation” spoke in 2013 about her work in nanotechnology and its applications within the fields of medicine and energy. The plasmonic nanostructures that Bardhan is researching have many applications, including use with solar cells. Using nanotechnology, the life and efficiency of solar cells can be increased. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/2013/02/vu-professor-discusses-nanotechonology-and-its-application-within-the-fields-of-medicine-energy/ 
6.	In 2013, Steven L. Krahn, professor of the practice of nuclear environmental engineering, was accepted by eminence into the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists as a Board Certified Environmental Engineering Member in the specialty practice of hazardous waste management. Krahn performs research in the technologies associated with the materials processing and risk assessment associated with the nuclear fuel cycle, and he actively participates in the Consortium for Risk Evaluation and Stakeholder Participation (CRESP), an engineering research center at Vanderbilt that works to advance cost-effective cleanup of the nation’s nuclear weapons production waste sites and test facilities. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/2013/07/krahn-receives-u-s-academy%E2%80%99s-environmental-engineering-certification/ 
7.	Eugene LeBoeuf, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Vanderbilt, was the third Vanderbilt environmental engineering faculty member in two years to be accepted into the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists as a board certified environmental engineering member. LeBoeuf’s research interests focus on developing improved methods to manage and increase sources of hydro-based renewable energy, and sustainable-energy water systems, including optimization of multi-reservoir hydropower systems. His current research projects are supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/2013/12/third-environmental-engineering-professor-is-certified-by-u-s-academy/ 
8.	Research published in 2013 four Vanderbilt University researchers found that if Americans use a comfortable water temperature when washing their hands, it could prevent the annual greenhouse gas emissions totaling the equivalent of the United States’ lead industry or the entire output of a small nation such as Barbados. The research group was led by Amanda R. Carrico, research assistant professor at the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment. Assisting with the study were Micajah Spoden, research analyst at Vanderbilt; Michael Vandenbergh, director of the Climate Change Research Network at Vanderbilt and David Daniels Allen Distinguished Chair of Law; and Kenneth A. Wallston, professor of psychology at the Vanderbilt School of Nursing. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/2013/12/use-water-at-%E2%80%98comfortable%E2%80%99-temperature-to-wash-hands-and-fight-global-warming/
9.	Michael Vandenbergh, David Daniels Allen Distinguished Chair of Law and director of Vanderbilt’s Climate Change Research Network, was invited to speak on “Buying Time: The Private Governance Response to Climate Change” at TEDxNashville. Professor Vandenbergh’s academic research explores the relationship between formal legal regulation and informal social regulation of individual and corporate behavior, the influence of social norms on corporate behavior, and the ways in which private contracting can enhance or undermine public governance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bXNcEQ6QX0&feature=youtu.be 
10.	Gabor Karsai, associate director of Vanderbilt’s Institute for Software Integrated Systems, and partners were awarded a $2.5 million award from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. The award will support Vanderbilt University School of Engineering researchers’ efforts to create software that can control the Smart Grid – a decentralized power system that is more efficient, sustainable and reliable than America’s current electrical power delivery. http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2015/11/vu-engineering-partners-awarded-grant-from-arpa-e-for-transformational-energy-technology/
11.	Jessica Oster, assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences at Vanderbilt University, is a member of a small group of earth scientists who are pioneering in the use of mineral cave deposits, collectively known as speleothems, as proxies for the prehistoric climate. The value of this information is illustrated by the results of a study published May 19 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters by Oster’s group, working with colleagues from the Berkeley Geochronology Center, the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History and the University of Cambridge titled “Northeast Indian stalagmite records Pacific decadal climate change: Implications for moisture transport and drought in India.” http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2015/05/deciphering-clues-to-prehistoric-climate-changes-locked-in-cave-deposits/ 
12.	Matt Lang, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, and Sonia Brady, a Ph.D. candidate in chemical engineering, are beginning to decode the process of how enzymes work to break down organic matter on the molecular level to unlock the promise of efficient and plentiful biofuels. Through cross-disciplinary collaborations, Lang and Brady were able to take that process down to a single-molecule assay. http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2015/turning-cellulose-into-biofuel-vu-prof-grad-student-search-for-key-on-molecular-level/ 
13.	Douglas Adams and his team of engineers in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering study “talking turbines” and the efficiencies that can be gained by analyzing data from sensors in wind turbine blades. According to the data, the sensors could significantly increase the productivity of established wind farms while helping design future farms that produce more electricity with fewer turbines, another piece of the puzzle that will ultimately drive down the cost of wind energy while utilizing less land for its production. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wind-energy-tracked-idUSKBN0M82LA20150312 
14.	Thirteen seed projects in environmental awareness and campus greening have been funded by the Eos Project, an initiative to promote greater understanding of environmental issues through diverse disciplines and channels across Vanderbilt. The Eos Project was developed to support innovative initiatives at Vanderbilt University to promote understanding of urgent environmental issues and social action-pathways to respond to the challenges of climate change. The goal is to energize attention to environment/society concerns in diverse disciplines and campus constituencies. The project organizes programming and offers small grants and fellowships to support faculty and students to develop the vision, knowledge, leadership skills, and networks needed to address pressing problems at the intersections of ecology and social justice, where the well-being of human communities is inseparable from the well-being of more-than-human life-worlds.
15.	Researchers at Vanderbilt’s Institute for Energy and the Environment and Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment have developed a computer model that provides new insights into the food-energy-water nexus and can help resource managers around the world do a better job of weighing food and energy tradeoffs when water is scarce. It is described in an article published on Jan. 14 in Environmental Research Letters. The new model adopts a standard economic approach called a “tradeoff frontier” to visualize the tradeoffs among food, energy and water in times of water scarcity: a condition that is becoming increasingly prevalent: The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts that the number of people living in areas of water scarcity will more than double by 2050.
16.	Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) is now working with the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University to develop smarter and easier to use applications for commuters in middle Tennessee. As the need for public transportation increases, the need for easy-to-use and commuter friendly systems become increasingly important. The T-HUB app provides these tools for commuters. Key features of the app include a real-time bus tracker, navigation, service alert notifications, calendar-based personal transit schedule management / notification and a comparison view to evaluate different trip options. By making public transit more predictable, the app encourages customers to use public transit more often. http://thub.isis.vanderbilt.edu/
17.	Sterling Ranch - Sterling Ranch, a 12,000-home planned community south of Denver, will provide a training site and test bed for School of Engineering students and professors. Its design is centered on sustainability and next-generation telecommunications, a focus that’s creating internships and capstone projects for engineering undergraduates plus research opportunities for professors and their teams.

Yoon-Na Cho, Dept of Marketing and Business Law",Emails were sent out to department leaders to identify those who had done sustainable research. ,"Samantha Chapman (Biology) conducts research at the intersection of ecosystem processes (including biotic influences on carbon and nutrient cycling) and sustainable practices. Her research is directed to inform ecosystem management and stakeholders. Ongoing projects in these areas include (1) mangrove community dynamics, plant-soil feedbacks, and shifting ranges; (2) carbon storage in Christmas tree farms; (3) interactions of native and non-native plant diversity with nitrogen availability associated with non-native plant invasion; and (4) microbial degradation of oil. http://www99.homepage.villanova.edu/samantha.chapman/chapman_ecosystem_ecology_lab/Home.html

Justinus Satrio (Chemical Engineering) just established the Biomass Resources & Conversion Technologies (BRCT) center, an education, research and development program in the College of Engineering at Villanova. Research focuses on utilizing biorenewable materials to produce energy, liquid fuels and chemical products, that typically are still primarily derived from non-renewable carbon resources. These include (1) improvement of biomass qualities and biorefinery feedstocks; (2) energy densification of biomass by liquefaction; (3) utilization of liquefied biomass (BCO); (4) assessments of sustainability and techno-economics of biomass utilization systems. http://www3.villanova.edu/biomass/

Robert Traver (Civil and Environmental Engineering) serves as Director of both the Center for the Advancement of Sustainability in Engineering, and the Villanova Urban Stormwater Partnership. He conducts research on topics that include modeling of stream hydraulics, urban hydrology, water quality, and sustainable stormwater management.  He initiated the Stormwater Best Management Practice Demonstration and Research Park on the Villanova Campus. In 2014, he presented a report calling for national strategy for resiliency in urban areas, “Flood Risk Management – Call for a National Strategy”.  He also received the 2014 William H. Wisely American Civil Engineer Award.

Kelman Wieder and Melanie Vile (Biology) conduct research in biogeochemistry and ecosystem ecology. Current research focuses on carbon cycling in boreal Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, especially with respect to ongoing climate change. As the earth's climate changes, in part driven by anthropogenic factors, it is unknown whether peatlands globally will continue to represent a net sink for atmospheric CO2, or whether they will shift and begin releasing stored C back to the atmosphere. Using a combination of field and laboratory, descriptive and experimental, studies, their research group strives to quantify pools of carbon in peat, carbon fluxes within peat and between peat and the atmosphere, and the biotic and abiotic controls on those fluxes.

","Although the college requests Faculty to self-report research. Although it was our initial intention to use these reports, it was determined that a good portion of people do not self-report, it is not mandatory. 

Also, we are not a research institution, and a lot of our efforts are more on student research. When you start going into student research, it gets fuzzy what does and does not count as measurable research. Does a research paper count?

Considering these elements, we chose to consider research which was published in a peer reviewed journal in the past two year by faculty. To gather this info, it was suggested that we communicate with our office coordinators. They have regular communication with all faculty in their area, and usually work with faculty as they are publishing. We sent a request to the coordinators. 

Due to the personal nature of this communication, we are confident in the accuracy. We believe our low numbers are because of the restricted nature of our scope, not due to lack of reporting.",,http://www.wartburg.edu/sustainability/Research.pdf,--

         Diana C. Parra Perez","Production of the University’s sustainability research inventory began with an examination of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research’s Annual Report for fiscal year 2015 (https://issuu.com/ovcr/docs/fy15annualreport). The report was reviewed to broadly classify research at the University.  It was quickly noted that the report under-reported total research at the University by narrowly focusing on research projects that received external funding support via grants and contracts in fiscal year.  Since not all disciplines rely equally on external funding to conduct research it was decided that a more individual review of research was required to fully identify sustainability research, especially across the academic departments outside the medical center.  Since research centers and other core infrastructure supports are very important to the University’s research enterprise the next step was to identify those centers that conducted sustainability research to identify faculty actively engaged in sustainability research projects.  Centers identified to be active in sustainability research include:
-	International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability
-	Consortium for Clean Coal Utilization
-	McDonnell Academy Global Energy and Environment Partnership 
-	Center for Genome Studies
-	Institute for Public Health
Reviewing these sites was helpful to identify critical masses of sustainability of research and to provide parameters for the more detailed inventory steps to be undertaken.  The final step in the inventory included a thorough review of each academic department’s faculty roster to identify tenure and tenure-track faculty engaged in sustainability research.  This was assessed through faculty members’ identified research areas, description of lab research projects, recent publications and other such descriptions. Results were cross-checked against the research listings of the sustainability activities of the identified research centers and through advanced searches of University and department websites.",,http://icares.wustl.edu/Pages/Home.aspx,"International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability (http://icares.wustl.edu/Pages/Home.aspx)

Common algae commercially grown to make fish food holds promise as a source for both biodiesel and jet fuel, according to new research by Western Washington University Associate Professor of Chemistry Greg O'Neil and Chris Reddy of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, recently published in the journal “Energy & Fuels.” The researchers exploited an unusual and untapped class of chemical compounds in the algae to synthesize two different fuel products, in parallel, from a single alga. Two current Western students, undergraduate Garrett Gilbert of Olympia and graduate student John Williams II of Battle Ground, assisted O’Neil in his research and were named in the study. O’Neil completed his research both at Western and at Woods Hole on Cape Cod. The project was supported by O’Neil’s $430,000 Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation.

•	WWU Geologist Pete Stelling Researching Geothermal Power Sources in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands - February 2015
	Western Washington University assistant professor of Geology Pete Stelling is researching how to turn the island’s volcanic core into a geothermal power source that could not only reduce the needed amount of imported fuel to a fraction of its current level but transform the quality of life for island inhabitants. Stelling is working on two parallel projects. The first is to continue working with an exploration team to harness the resource for the benefit of the island’s population in a way that is far more economically viable and far less environmentally damaging than the current diesel-based methods. The second is to understand just how efficient these secondary geothermal sources are and apply these lessons worldwide. Stelling is planning future next research locations in similarly volcanic locations such as Chile and Colombia. The Aleutian Island research has been funded by the City of Akutan, the Alaska Energy Authority, the U.S. Dept. of Energy and Western Washington University.

•	Western Creates Ocean Acidification Research Endowment – July 2015
Through a gift from Dr. Greg Rau (’71), Western has established the Ocean Acidification Research endowment for faculty, staff and student-focused activities at Western’s Anacortes-based Shannon Point Marine Center. Dr. Rau intends the endowment to address the critical issue of ocean acidification. The funds will help faculty, staff, and students to complete creative and innovative research in ocean acidification in order to conserve marine ecosystems in Washington, the Pacific Northwest and the world.

•	NSF Early Career Development Award – May 2013
Western Washington University Assistant professor of Chemistry John Gilbertson was awarded a prestigious five-year, $470,000 Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation for his research into breaking down harmful greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and transforming them into useful compounds. The award was one of only a handful given out to master’s-granting institutions like Western and is the University’s third such award in three years. Gilbertson and his team of students are investigating how to use cheap, Earth-abundant metals to transform the typically unreactive carbon dioxide molecule into useful chemicals and fuels, such as syngas and methanol, as well as producing a series of videos focused on science-education topics of regional and national interest.
