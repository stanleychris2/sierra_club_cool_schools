Dr. Ferguson's continuing leadership and advocacy has led to the creation of new initiatives by Second Nature wherein carbon reduction and campus resilience have been unified under a Climate Leadership Commitment which Dr. Ferguson has signed on behalf of Ball State University. 

This replaces the ACUPCC commitment, broadening efforts to face the realities of the growing climate crisis.

Our previous president, Dr. Jo Ann Gora, served on the Steering Committee of the ACUPCC and chaired a subcommittee of the ACUPCC to develop financing options for campuses.

This built on prior work with Jim Elder to develop a ""chorus of voices"" in support of some enhancements to the EISA Section 471 Program. 

Here's the gist of what our university continues to push for:
EISA Section 471 Program:
In 2007 Congress enacted the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA). Section 471 of that Act creates a new program called ""Energy Sustainability and Efficiency Grants and Loans for Institutions."" The Section 471 Program will provide an important source of grant funding to help implement energy efficiency projects at colleges, universities, school districts and municipalities.
While the program has been created in law, Congress has not yet funded the program.

Grant Cap:
Unfortunately, EISA Section 471 includes a $1 million cap on any grant award made by the U.S. Department of Energy under the program. This cap is problematic for two reasons:
1) The purpose of the Section 471 program is to provide grants to large institutional entities (colleges, universities, school districts, municipalities) for energy efficiency projects. By their very nature, such entities are going to have larger projects with higher costs. The Department of Energy should have the flexibility to assist institutional entities with grants of a meaningful size.
2) At some point in time, we would all like to see the House and Senate Appropriations Committees fund this new program. However, to do so, they will need to see support from the intended beneficiaries. With the current $1 million cap on grant awards, there is just not enough interest in the program to generate support. The potential federal assistance is not enticing enough.

Cornell Policies
Equipment Efficiency Standards Policy
Implement an efficiency standards policy for equipment purchases at Cornell.
Goal: Establish energy-efficient standards based upon Energy Star certification for new purchases and bids.
Establishing energy efficiency requirements for new purchases and bids can help to reduce the life-cycle cost of the product or equipment purchased. Energy-efficient products (such as ENERGY STAR-rated products) reduce energy consumption by 10-75% and result in operational cost savings of 5-75% percent on a continual basis, depending on the product replaced.
http://www.sustainablecampus.cornell.edu/initiatives/equipment-efficiency-standards-policy

Building Energy Standards Policy
Achieving a goal of 50% lower energy use... Adopt a university-wide policy that all new construction projects and renovations valued over 5M should achieve a minimum 50% energy savings compared to the baseline established by ASHRAE 90.1.
Goal: The 2009 Climate Action Plan (CAP) prescribed Energy Use Intensity (EUI) standards by building type to ensure that future construction on campus would be optimized to limit energy consumption. Cornell’s current EUI standards reduce laboratory and office energy use by 30% over the energycode- compliant baseline (ASHRAE 90.1). The 2009 CAP recommended that, in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the university should ultimately require new buildings on campus to limit energy usage to 50% of the industry standard baseline. Achieving a goal of 50% lower energy use effectively reduces the rate of growth in GHG emissions by half.
http://www.sustainablecampus.cornell.edu/initiatives/building-energy-standards-policy

Carbon Neutral Travel Policy
Encouraging reduced business travel and purchase of offsets when travel is unavoidable...
Establish a university-wide Carbon Neutral Travel Policy that fosters zero-footprint travel through purchase of carbon offsets.
Goal: University-funded air travel and individual commuting emitted roughly 59,000 tons of carbon into the atmosphere in 2012, a nearly 10% increase since the Climate Action Plan was initiated and the only emission category that did not improve. Cornell’s commitment to climate neutrality cannot be achieved without some offsetting actions to mitigate these travel related emissions. Putting a price on GHG emissions via carbon offsets is an effective strategy to raise awareness about travel-related emissions and presents an excellent opportunity to invest in high impact local sustainability initiatives.

Grants Further Environmental Policy Research
2 USDA grants further research of Cornell professors Harry de Gorter and Mildred Warner on the effects of environmental policy on biofuels and development...
Biofuels tick many boxes off policymaker wish lists: energy security, environmental quality, improved farm incomes. But as ethanol has shown, they can also have unintended consequences on domestic and international economies by increasing demand – and prices – of former food crops such as corn.
A $499,998 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture – one of two awarded to Cornell as part of a $12 million program – will allow researchers to delve deeper into the intricate interactions between crops and biofuel policies at home and abroad, and their implications for the international competitiveness of U.S. agriculture.

GMC is the lead institution in southern Vermont engaged in this practice. Not only do these advocacy speeches help to influence students, but the College tries to expand their impact through strategic press releases about the events, so that the platforms of the speakers can draw attention from the media. 

Among the examples of advocacy speakers the College has had in recent years are:

Senator Patrick Leahy who spoke about his recent effort to get the US to sign a treaty banning land mines (Commencement, 2014). 

Jonathan Lash who spoke about what we can do to address climate change in an innovative way despite lack of action at the national level (Benson Lecture Series, 2014).

Dianne Dillon-Ridgley who spoke about sustainable development (Commencement, 2013).

Bill Schlesinger who spoke about climate change and how we can address it amidst the current gridlock in Congress (Sophomore Plenary, 2013). 

Andrew Gunther who spoke about humane treatment of animals and delivered GMC's new AWA certification for dairy cattle and poultry on the campus farm.

Majora Carter who spoke about social justice and sustainable development (Commencement, 2012). 

In addition to bringing in strategic speakers, in 2013, GMC issued a statement to the student panel on divestment at the Warsaw climate negotations, challenging other schools to divest from fossil fuel holdings as GMC has committed to do. 

","GMC President Fonteyn signed a letter in April of 2014 written by Bill Schlesinger of The Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies urging the UK's Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Edward Davey, to apply more judicious use of biomass electricity as a carbon-neutral substitute for fossil fuels. The letter was co-signed by many prominent US scientists and articulated a concern about the rising use of wood sourced from Southern US forests as a fuel for electricity-generating power plants in the UK and Europe. In particular, they asked for swift action to develop and adopt sustainability criteria and carbon accounting requirements to ensure adequate protections for forests and the climate.

In 2014, GMC's Chaplain, Shirley Oskamp, led a campaign to send a letter on behalf of GMC to the United Methodist Church to express discontent over the Church's action of defrocking Rev.

First, the Center, in collaboration with the Department of Economics and Haverford alumni, developed a non-credit seminar on sustainable investing.  This seminar consisted of six two-hour sessions where students, faculty and alumni discussed the theory of sustainable investing using examples drawn from the College and the business community.  Participants met with practitioners (e.g., Haverford’s investment fund manager) and a representative from the Responsible Endowments Coalition (REC), who led a discussion of shareholder activism on college campuses around the country.  In addition, the students participated in an on-line investing simulation using software developed by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.  Participants were given the opportunity to make “investments” using real market data.  At the end of the seminar, the students reported back to the CISR on what they had learned.  The seminar galvanized a small group of students to embrace shareholder activism as a means to express their social justice concerns. 
Building on this initial effort, the CPGC facilitated further contact with the REC to encourage student training in shareholder activism.  This consisted of support for attendance at REC-sponsored conferences, hosting a regional meeting of representatives from other colleges, and a brainstorming session for students and the chair of the CISR to discern student interests related to shareholder activism.  As a result of these efforts, student participation in CISR activities has grown from a small advisory role to one where student interests are driving the issues under the Committee’s care.   "

Indiana University Bloomington,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 09:44:14,brownwm@indiana.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"During the past three legislative sessions, Indiana University has advocated for and helped to shape several pieces of legislation that support sustainability initiatives in areas of energy efficiency, social justice, and student access to and completion of higher education.

During the 2014 legislative session, Indiana University, along with other state supported institutions, advocated for legislation that would increase the statutory limit on the amount of outstanding debt that institutions may have to finance Qualified Energy Savings Projects. Indiana University Bloomington is now able to bond up to $80 million for these projects, which allows the University to improve energy efficiency while providing a means to accomplish smaller repair and rehabilitation projects. Prior to the passage of this legislation, campuses were not able to bond more than $15 million for such projects.  

IU has a history of supporting this type of legislation and was successful in advocating for raising the limits during the 2009 legislative session. IU will continue to support increased bond limits for Qualified Energy Savings Projects in the future.","IU also played a critical role in 2014 by advocating against a constitutional amendment that provided that only marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Indiana. IU Vice President and General Counsel, Jacqueline Simmons provided expert testimony in opposition of the bill to explain the negative impacts upon the university and why it was important to Indiana University to take a position on the bill. Due largely in part to this testimony, the bill was amended to remove a portion of the bill which experts believe would have prohibited employers from providing domestic partner benefits. Because the bill was amended before its passage, the amendment must be passed by another General Assembly before proceeding to the ballot for citizens to consider. 

Had the bill passed without amendment and been eligible for a vote by the public, IU believes that the amendment would have adversely affected the recruitment of world-class faculty, staff and students, as well as jeopardize current IU policy offering domestic partner benefit policies. Taking this position was important to the university not only to promote equity on our campuses, but also to bring equity to citizens across Indiana, which is a key element of sustainability for IU. (http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2014/resolutions/house/joint/3#) 

In 2014, Indiana University, along with Purdue University and veterans groups, supported legislation that would require state educational institutions to adopt policies to award college credit to veterans who complete college courses or certain equivalency exams. This legislation was important to IU because it will increase predictability for veterans about the types of credits that will transfer to the institution, which will lead to their academic success. (http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2014/bills/senate/331/#)

Indiana University, along with other state supported institutions of higher education, supported legislation during the 2013 legislative session that would increase access and affordability for higher education for undocumented students and veterans. In 2011, legislation was passed that prohibited state educational institutions from enrolling undocumented students who met residency requirements at the resident tuition rate. The bill passed during the 2013 legislative session allowed undocumented students who were enrolled in a state educational institution prior to passage of the 2011 bill to enroll in a state educational institution at the resident rate. This allows students who were already enrolled in a degree program to complete their degrees. Indiana University is very supportive of these students and would support legislation that would allow all undocumented students who otherwise meet residency requirements to enroll at the resident tuition rate. That piece of legislation also had a provision supported by Indiana University that would allow veterans who enroll in a state educational institution within 12 months of discharge from the armed forces to enroll in the institution at the resident tuition rate, as long as they take certain steps to establish residency in the state, such as registering to vote or obtaining an Indiana driver’s license or state identification card. Both provisions of this bill are important to the university because they expand access to and diversity of the institution. (http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2013/PDF/SE/SE0207.1.pdf) The second provision of the bill was also passed in nearly identical form in another bill: http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2013/PDF/SE/SE0177.1.pdf.

In 2012 and 2013, Indiana University, along with other state supported institutions, helped to pass two pieces of legislation that expanded access to higher education and methods of transferring credits among state educational institutions. Recognizing that increasing numbers of students begin their postsecondary education and one institution before transferring to another institution, the public colleges and universities worked together to ensure that credits would transfer in blocks and ensure certain educational outcomes, which helps students to better predict how their credits will transfer and a leads students to a higher probability of academic success upon transferring to another educational institution. The bill passed in 2012 and established the Statewide Transfer General Education Core, which ensured that a block of 30 credit hours taken at one institution would satisfy certain general education outcomes and transfer as a whole to the institution in which the student transfers. (http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2012/PDF/SE/SE0182.1.pdf) The following year, institutions again worked together to establish Single Articulation Pathways, which ensure that students who obtain associate degrees in highly subscribed majors are able to transfer to a four-year institution and enter the institution at a junior status, guaranteeing the ability to graduate in four years. This bill is also based on competencies that must be achieved, ensuring educational outcomes and academic success after transfer to a four-year institution.

There is a growing understanding among academics and policy makers that the role of “place” in economic development is changing. In the Old Economy, places with high economic potential included those places exhibiting the physical resources and infrastructure, and potentially tax incentives, to attract large companies. In the New Economy, however, economic growth is driven more by human capital, particularly “knowledge workers,” who are highly mobile and can locate anywhere. These talented individuals are looking for places that are vibrant (nightlife, arts and culture, diversity), connected (walkable, bikable, transit-oriented), green (parks, trails, energy efficiency) and entrepreneur friendly. Also, because the economies of communities within a region are interdependent, regional collaboration and the pursuit of common visions is necessary to achieve effective placemaking. Activities within this focus area seek to help communities better understand the role of place in regional prosperity, and identify policies and programs that support this transformation.

Oberlin College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 16:09:59,bflynn@oberlin.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The Oberlin Project provides a framework for Oberlin College and the City of Oberlin to work collaboratively to adopt new ordinances and policies to increase the sustainability of our community. For example, our Grounds Department lobbied for changes to ordinances to permit natural landscaping. In recognition of the importance of sustainability, Professor David W. Orr, a leading faculty voice on these issues, was appointed Special Assistant to President on Sustainability and Environmental Affairs. He speaks and advocates internationally for sustainability policies.

Oberlin has advocated for renewable energy through the creation of the sustainable reserve fund. When Oberlin College agreed to purchase an estimated 60% of its electricity from green sources, the college worked with the municipal power utility and the City Council to create a Sustainable Reserve Fund from the money paid towards green attributes. This fund contains the $2 per MWhr that Oberlin pays as a premium for green power. This money is overseen by the City Council and is available for local energy conservation and greenhouse gas reducing projects. So far, portions of these funds have gone towards two local projects: the purchase and erection of a wind monitoring tower to assess the potential for local wind energy generation, and the infrastructure for a local biofuels station that sells biodiesel and ethanol fuels.

Oberlin took a leadership role in environmental stewardship it became one of the nation’s first institutions of higher education to accept the goal of climate neutrality by signing the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). As a charter signatory, Oberlin was one of the first four schools in the United States and the first in its peer group to sign the ACUPCC. Building on the growing momentum of action on climate change, the ACUPCC provides a framework and supporting mechanisms for America’s colleges and universities to rapidly accelerate this effort. It capitalizes on the critical role of colleges and universities to serve as examples for their communities and to train the people who will develop the social, economic and technological solutions to reverse global warming.

Following the completion of the College’s first greenhouse gas inventory, the Office of Environmental Sustainability worked with the Committee on Environmental Sustainability to develop a comprehensive Campus Climate Action Plan. This plan assesses the impacts of the college’s current level of emissions, develop indicators and targets for continual improvement and outline a specific implementation plan and priorities for improvement. In 2009, Oberlin submitted A Plan to be Carbon Neutral that set a target of carbon neutrality by 2025. Following the college's lead, the city of Oberlin passed their own Climate Action Plan in 2011, which Oberlin College endorsed and signed. The plan set systematic goals of reducing the baseline inventory emissions by 50% by 2015, 75% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The City is on track to reach the first milemarker through a power purchase agreement to receive 90% renewable electricity by 2015.

Oberlin College was a key player in the development of the City of Oberlin's Zero Waste Plan. The City observed many of the strategies that the College has used to reduce waste, increase recycling, and conserve resources, and worked to adapt and apply these strategies to the city as a whole.

(1) In May 2013, 48 Stanford scientists joined in presenting California Governor Jerry Brown with a consensus statement urging immediate and drastic action to address climate change. The document was signed by 520 scientists from 44 countries. The statement was delivered at Sustainable Silicon Valley’s Water, Energy, and Smart Technology Summit at the NASA Ames Research Center.

(2) During the Stanford-MIT Game-Changers Workshop on March 7, 2013, energy researchers from Stanford and MIT met with members of Congress and the Obama administration to discuss game-changing energy technologies that will boost America’s long term economic growth and address serious energy challenges, including climate change and reliability of supplies. Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, chair of the Shultz-Stephenson Task Force on Energy Policy at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, also advocated for implementation of a revenue-neutral carbon tax in the U.S. to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

(3) In the 2012-2013 academic year, former U.S. senator and Stanford Law School alumnus Jeff Bingaman joined the Steyer-Taylor Center at Stanford (jointly run by the Law School and Graduate School of Business) as a distinguished fellow to develop policies to assist states and local communities in promoting increased use of clean energy.

(4) In the 2012-2013 academic year, students in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources joint master’s program presented final capstone projects, including presenting an amicus brief to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to argue that California’s AB 32 should include life cycle analysis for ethanol. 

(5) The Precourt Institute for Energy (PIE) runs several centers and programs based around policy advocacy, such as the Bay Area Photovoltaic Consortium, the Shultz-Stephenson Task Force on Energy Policy, and the Stanford Environmental and Energy Policy Analysis Center. These entities participate in ongoing work in sustainability policy advocacy. 

(6) Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment is helping leaders from the public and private sectors address sustainability challenges through a series of dialogues and workshops focused on key public policy issues. As a trusted and neutral source of research and information, Woods brings business, government and NGO leaders together with experts from Stanford and other academic institutions to create practical solutions to the world's most pressing environmental challenges. Through these “uncommon dialogues”, the Woods Institute creates a two-way flow of information to help inform Stanford's environmental research. For more information, visit: https://woods.stanford.edu/news-events/dialogues-workshops

(7) The Woods Institute’s Water in the West Program is assisting the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in the development of its western water conservation strategy, which will help determine the foundation’s investment priorities in seven critical ecoregions. 

(8) Stanford Law School’s Environmental and Natural Resources Law and Policy Program along with the Woods Institute’s Center for Ocean Solutions, organized an international symposium on adaptive marine reserves in the 2012-2013 academic year. 

(9) In 2010, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors approved a ""Green Building Ordinance"" for unincorporated Santa Clara County (a second phase of the 2008 ordinance of the same name, which only addressed single-family homes). Stanford lies in unincorporated Santa Clara county and is the source of most non-residential and multi-family new construction in this area. Building on its track record of environmental stewardship with respect to water use and sustainable design and construction, Stanford has worked actively with the county since the approval of the Green Building Ordinance to develop alternate means compliance paths for the ordinance. Alternate means allow inclusion of innovative practices and methods that go beyond either CAL Green or LEED to be included in demonstration of building performance equivalent with the county ordinance.

SUNY-ESF academic and scientific leadership strongly advocated against one-sided and narrowly-drawn definitions of renewable biomass as proposed in HR 2454; as did almost all of the national biomass community. SUNY-ESF said the bill’s proposed definition was not in the best interests of the New York-Northeastern forest community nor the entire national forest community. The SUNY-ESF academic and scientific leadership reiterated that woody biomass is a substantial, CO2-neutral renewable resource that can be used as a fuel for a variety of sustainable and environmentally sound energy applications.  They urged congressional leadership to replace the HR 2454 definition with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PL 109-58) definition as the “more perfect definition.” As a more perfect definition, the definition of biomass in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (HR 6-PL 109-58) remains the clearest and most concise definition in public law. SUNY-ESF also proposed, as an alternative starting point, the proposed definition, in a bill to amend the Clean Air Act, ""The Renewable Fuel Standard Improvement Act.""  HR-2409.

The process, led by the Commissioner of Planning in Orange County and Commissioner of Community Development & Conservation in the Town of Greenburgh, included representatives from the Mid-Hudson Region of New York State, the seven counties located immediately north of New York City (NYC): Westchester County, Rockland County, Orange County, Putnam County, Dutchess County, Ulster County, and Sullivan County.
 
The Mid-Hudson Regional Sustainability Plan was developed through extensive research and a consensus building process open to stakeholders from throughout the region. This process was overseen by a planning consortium consisting of senior representatives of the region’s seven counties as well as government and non-governmental organizations. The plan sets out a vision for sustainable development that builds on the region’s unique social, cultural, and natural history, with the goal of promoting economic development, environmental sustainability, and enhancing quality of life for the more than two million residents that call our region home.  By engaging hundreds of stakeholders from each of our region’s seven counties in the development of the plan, a series of objectives has been established that reflects our region’s diverse landscapes, demographics, economy, culture, and history.

Nonetheless, Texas A&M is a long-standing leader in the discussion and engagement regarding sustainability at the state and federal level. This epitomizes the Land-grant university obligation to take scientific discovery to citizens through practical use. Thus, the engagement is providing science-based solutions to public problems as defined by policy makers. 

Texas A&M faculty help comprise the campus-based Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL).  ESL is a division of the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station and a member of the Texas A&M University System. The ESL is affiliated with the Energy Systems Group in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (five faculty), as well as faculty from the Department of Architecture in the College of Architecture.

The ESL was assigned an important role by state officials in the implementation of state energy standards and assistance with calculation of emissions reduction benefits from energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives as part of the Texas Emissions Reduction Program (TERP).  During the most recent Texas legislative session, A&M faculty, through the ESL, participated in weekly meetings during the Texas Legislative session regarding energy efficiency and sustainability legislation and served as the scientific resource for this group of sustainability-related interests.  Specifically, Texas A&M faculty served as resource witnesses for legislation that eventually became law. 

Specifically, the ESL and faculty engaged with policy makers on a comprehensive emissions reduction plan.  The legislation modified the New Technology Implementation Grant program, Texas Clean Fleet program, and Texas Natural Gas Vehicle program, among others.  The ESL and A&M faculty are charged with working with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality “for computation of creditable statewide emissions reductions” in the programs noted above as well placing a priority on programs to address the reduction of certain emissions related to operation of drilling, production, completions, etc. related to oil and gas production.

On the federal level, Texas A&M seeks opportunities for increased funding for energy research in the Department of Energy (DOE) including the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Office of Science, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and the Biomass Program, as well as through DOE programs such as the Innovation Hubs, and Energy Frontier Research Centers.  Texas A&M is also engaged in energy efficiency and related research efforts ongoing in DOE and other agencies (e.g. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Interior, and National Science Foundation).  As an example, Texas A&M has an NSF funded project to significantly alleviate the skyrocketing energy consumption associated with data centers by leveraging available technology.

In addition, Texas A&M actively engages with the congressional committees that authorize and appropriate funding for research related to energy and sustainability. Active engagement has occurred with House Appropriations; House Energy and Commerce; House Science, Space, and Technology Committees.  Texas A&M researchers served as a resource to the committees as they craft policy by reviewing draft legislation and serving as witnesses for Congressional hearings on topics ranging from droughts to fracking. 
","As noted above, Texas A&M is prohibited by the legislature and governing board policy from taking “political positions” on legislation or political candidates. Engagement regarding sustainability in the public arena occurs as an object science based resource for public policy makers.",Not applicable since Texas A&M University is a public university.,--,--

(2) When legislation was introduced in the Ohio General Assembly to create a new state commission with oversight of leasing public lands for oil and gas development, Ohio State argued successful in the Ohio General Assembly to keep its authority over potential drilling on Ohio State property and to ensure that as long as we were using our property open to development for research and teaching proposes, that we would maintain  control over revenue generated from hydrocarbon development on Ohio State property.
 
(3) When Senator Rob Portman was working on legislation in Congress focused on energy efficiency, Ohio State provided extensive comments to the Senator’s office on the draft legislation and subsequently our  then Vice President for Energy and Environment wrote an op-ed published in the Columbus Dispatch supporting the legislation as introduced.

The following are The University of California Fiscal Year 2015 Appropriations Priorities for the California Delegation of the Federal Government. 

UC supports $360 million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), which
funds competitive research on human nutrition and health, agricultural sustainability, renewable
energy and biofuels, water supply, and air and water quality. UC scientists typically receive 10-15 percent of competitive USDA research grants. 

UC supports the funding levels above for the Hatch, Smith-Lever 3(b)-3(c) and McIntireStennis
capacity grant programs, which are crucial to UC’s agricultural research and extension
work, and are vitally important given the current California drought. The programs enable UC to
support California agricultural producers by improving conservation practices, production
efficiencies, varietal development and cropping methods.

UC supports $68 million for the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP),
which successfully delivers hands-on, practical lessons on food, nutrition and healthy lifestyles to
needy families. National studies show that for every $1 invested in this Cooperative Extension
program, up to $10.64 is saved in current and future healthcare costs for “at risk” populations.

UC supports $41.35 million for OAR Sustained Ocean Observations and Monitoring. UC
researchers are critical partners in maintaining baseline ocean observations to support weather
and regional climate predictions, fisheries management and ecosystem studies, tide and current
monitoring and sea level change. 

UC supports $40.5 million for the Regional Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), a
national network that addresses maritime commerce, fisheries, aquaculture, offshore energy,
coastal communities, public health and other users’ needs. UC is active in two systems, the
Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) and the Southern
California Coastal Ocean Observing System (SCCOOS). 

UC supports $5.223 billion in funding for the DOE Office of Science (OS), the primary federal agency supporting physical sciences research. Among its missions, the OS funds research on new materials, future energy sources, energy efficiency and high performance scientific computing and several STEM education and fellowship programs. The OS also funds world-class national laboratories, including the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and other user facilities that serve thousands of university researchers, students and industry scientists every year. UC’s request for modest growth will provide a buffer for university-based DOE researchers as OS transitions to its new policy of forward funding new grants. UC also supports proposed new DOE investments in Advanced Manufacturing technologies; as well as the Energy Frontier Research Centers and Energy Innovation Hubs, which focus on fundamental energy science and discrete technology solutions that are funded by OS and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

UC supports $325 million in funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPAE),
which is focused on achieving U.S. leadership in clean technologies to transform our energy
landscape. 

UC supports $6.5 million for the USGS Water Resources Research Institutes (WRRI) – the
only federally supported research network for applied water resource research, education,
training and outreach. UC operates the California Institute for Water Resources (CIWR) which
supports researchers in developing solutions to some of California’s most costly and difficult
water problems. With the ongoing California drought, CIWR is actively engaged in providing
information and resources to California producers, consumers, businesses, and state and local
governments.

UC supports $149.1 million for USGS Climate and Land Use Change, including $35.3
million for the Climate Science Centers. These programs provide fundamental scientific
information, tools, and techniques that states, other federal agencies and regional partners can
use to make better-informed land, water and wildlife management decisions. For example, the
Southwest Climate Science Center serves California and other states with physical and biological
research, ecological forecasting and multiscale modeling for scientists and other stakeholders to
improve decision making, best practices and communications on the changing effects of the
North Pacific Jet on water resources and Sierra Nevada fires.

The UH Office of Governmental Relations has a permanent Austin Office, fully staffed during legislative sessions, to serve as the University's ""ear to the ground"" during legislative decisions. The information collected by this office greatly affects the universities internal reactions to external policy. Emphasizing an engaged and comprehensive approach, the office focuses on establishing collaborative partnerships within the community, implementing a proactive external affairs program and maintaining mutually productive relationships with government entities. 

On the federal level, the University of Houston hires the lobby group Akin Gump to lobby for the support of Education and Energy at the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, Department of Energy, and Department of the Interior. Further governmental support for bills relating to these positions is vital for sustainability; in higher education particularly. Furthermore, Akin Gump has active corporate social responsibility and sustainability components (www.akingump.com/en/our-firm/sustainability.html). 

Faculty and staff also engage in governmental committees and offer expert testimony, particularly on education and the energy industry. Detailed examples are given below. 



","As a public institution, the University of Houston maintains a nonpartisan position but engages in the political process by means of advocacy and expert testimony.
 
A recent example on the federal level, Dr. Ramanan Krishnamoorti, acting vice president/vice chancellor for research and technology transfer at the University of Houston, gave testimony before Congress about an innovative workforce training program developed for the energy industry. Krishnamoorti, who also is chief energy officer at UH, also addressed the Energy and Power subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

Dr. Krishnamoorti was asked to testify about the new program at a hearing that focused on the 21st century energy workforce, in conjunction with legislation proposed by subcommittee member U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois. Rush has proposed a bill to improve training for energy-related jobs, with an emphasis on increasing the number of skilled minorities and women in the industry. Krishnamoorti even made clear that the program developed by UH, working with area community colleges and members of industry, can be replicated by other higher education institutions once it has been demonstrated and assessed here.

In regards to city governance, throughout 2014, Dr. Barry Lefer (former Associate Department Chair and Associate Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at UH) served as a member for the ""One Bin for All"" Mayor's Advisory committee.

Prior to signing, he solicited statements of support from area leaders, including UofL President James Ramsey who responded with the following public statement: “The University of Louisville has been a leader in higher education with its commitment to environmental sustainability. In fact, the University of Louisville is committed to accountability – academic accountability, financial accountability and environmental accountability. We fully support Mayor Fisher’s participation with Compact of Mayors and for committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Louisville Metro area.”

UofL's Sustainable Urban Neighborhoods center regularly advocates for more sustainable urban planning and development strategies that would not only enhance the sustainability of cities in general and of our city in particular, but would also benefit our urban campus. The Center advocates for issues such as enhanced walkability & bikeability, transit-oriented development, affordable housing, increased density, mixed-use developments, and historic preservation. As one example of this work, on March 16, 2015, the Center published an op-ed in the local Courier-Journal newspaper advocating for the conversion of one-way, car-centric corridors to two-way, pedestrian- and business-friendly streets: ""More than one way to think about urban streets"": http://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/03/16/one-way-think-urban-streets/24847471/

In May 2012, UofL advocated against reductions in service to Louisville's public transit system, operated by the Transit Authority of River City. The University stated that the proposed changes ""would have a significant, detrimental impact on the University and many members of its community.

UofL's Center for Environmental Education has been involved in advocacy as follows:
1. Task force on the Master Plan for Environmental Education in Kentucky (recommendations for the next five years to the legislature and stakeholders in the state).
2. Task Force on a plan for Environmental Education for the Kentucky Department of Education in preparation for No Child Left Inside federal funding.
3. Participation in the National Association of Biology Teachers Task Force for NRC framework for new science standards offering support for interdisciplinary, ecological, environmental, action oriented content laden orientation.

UofL's advocacy for responsible energy policy in the Commonwealth of Kentucky dates back to 2008, when UofL's President Ramsey joined in a statewide initiative called ""Energizing Kentucky"" which was launched with this joint statement from the presidents of Berea College, Centre College, University of Kentucky, and University of Louisville:
""We believe higher education has an important role to play in the work ahead: framing issues, seeking solutions, providing basic and applied research, and educating the next generation. We know that this work requires a partnership across the Commonwealth that includes business and public policy leaders, as well as those involved in education. We four presidents, representing both public and private institutions, propose a public policy focus on energy for the Commonwealth of Kentucky that we call 'Energizing Kentucky.'"" As the brainchild of Berea College President Larry D. Shinn, Centre College President John A. Roush, University of Kentucky President Lee T. Todd Jr. and University of Louisville President James Ramsey, Energizing Kentucky encourages Kentucky to focus on a coherent and integrated energy policy and will assist this policy formation by bringing together state and national energy experts to discuss the economic, educational, and environmental opportunities and challenges presented by the world's current energy situation.

Jackson’s contributions to conservation in Massachusetts include co-founding the River and Stream Continuity Project, which developed standards for culverts and bridges to help minimize their impact on wildlife and river health and created approaches for prioritizing replacement of these road-stream crossings. These methods are now being used across New England and the northeast to protect and restore river continuity.

Jackson also led the use of underpass systems to facilitate wildlife movement across roads and in development of methods for evaluating the effectiveness of animal-passage structures, beginning with construction and evaluation of the Henry Street tunnels in Amherst in 1987, the first such structures in North America. This early experiment helped establish the foundation for widespread adoption of wildlife crossing structures in the U.S. and Canada.

Jackson also co-led the statewide Critical Linkages connectivity assessment completed in 2013 by the UMass Amherst landscape ecology program. Critical Linkages identifies the dams, road-stream crossings and road segments most important for conservation and transportation agencies to address in order to minimize the impact of these structures on wildlife movement and viability, while maintaining a safe and reliable transportation infrastructure.

For all of these efforts Jackson was named 2013 MA Conservationist of the Year by the Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts. ",,,http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/jackson-named-conservationist-year-nature,"In earlier years, Raymond S. Bradley, director of the Center for Climate Change, was one of many researchers affiliated with UMass Amherst who contributed to reports issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The reports earned the panel the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, shared with environmentalist Al Gore.

The Nobel Committee granted the prize to the IPCC and Gore “for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.” The three assessment reports issued explained the physical science basis of global climate change, predicted future impacts of climate change and suggested steps toward mitigation.

Research conducted by Bradley and Michael E. Mann detailed substantial human-induced rates of global warming in a 1999 paper that was the major highlight of the third IPCC assessment report.

As part of the state budget consideration process in both the 2013 Long Session and 2014 Short Session of the North Carolina General Assembly, UNC campuses advocated to increase the amount of funds permitted by law to be carried forward from one fiscal year to the next to support strategic investments including the implementation of energy savings projects and other efficiency initiatives.
  
In February 2013, UNC schools presented a policy proposal to the legislature regarding energy service contracts. Previously, only one campus in the system was permitted to implement energy conservation measures without an ESCO under the provisions of G.S. 143-64.17L. In August 2013 an additional campus in the system was permitted by the General Assembly to self-perform energy conservation and efficiency efforts (SL 2013-396). UNCG has asked the UNC System to support legislative efforts to expand this provision to include other universities (UNCG and others) so that all universities have the option to either use an ESCO or implement energy conservation projects on their own. It is generally accepted that ESCO contracts have profit margins in the 30% range. Allowing the universities to implement these projects without the involvement of an ESCO will result in investing the ESCO profit (say 30%) into actual energy conservation measures (primarily equipment) that will result in increasing the energy savings of the state.

University of Texas at Arlington,2016-02-26,2016-02-26 12:36:41,mtare@uta.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The Institution has adopted an Anti-idling policy similar to the State policy, Texas Administrative Code Title 30. 
http://www.epa.gov/smartway/documents/420b06004.pdf 

Application: 
Idling vehicles use up several billion gallons of fuel and emit large quantities of air pollution and greenhouse gases each year in the United States. Idle reduction technologies and practices are an important way to cut petroleum consumption and emissions.  Idling of any vehicle for more than five minutes from April through October is prohibited in the City of Arlington.  Fines vary (Reference Texas Administrative Code 30.114.510-30.114.517).  

UT Arlington as part of their sustainability initiatives and as a good neighbor policy, has adopted the following idling policy.  UT Arlington’s policy applies to the operation of all vehicles that are on the main campus or any of the university’s offsite campuses.    

Rationale
Exhaust from idling engines can accumulate in and around the emission source and pose an exposure to faculty, students, staff, drivers, operators, and the community at large. UT Arlington is located in an EPA non-attainment area where every effort must be given to improving air quality. It has also been determined that these exhausts are toxic and that long-term exposure has a potential for increased health risk.

Policy
-	To ensure compliance with current regulatory requirements, and to eliminate unnecessary idling of all UT Arlington vehicles and outside vehicles that has a gross weight rating of 14,000 pounds or higher on UT Arlington controlled property for more than five (5) minutes, unless one or more of the listed exceptions exist.   All UT Arlington personnel shall be made aware of this policy prior to operations and refreshed as necessary.  It is the responsibility of the department supervisor, operations manager, or other designated personnel where equipment is operating to implement and enforce this policy.  
-	All drivers/operators and/or their companies shall be made aware of this policy when they operate on UT Arlington property and shall be provided a copy of this policy and requirements if requested.
-	UT Arlington staff or agents functioning as operators on behalf of UT Arlington shall be instructed on this policy and record of that instruction maintained by UT Arlington for a minimum of three (3) years.  
-	When drivers/operators arrive at loading or unloading areas to drop-off or pick-up passengers, supplies, food, goods, equipment, etc., they shall turn off their vehicle’s engine as soon as possible but no later than five (5) minutes after arrival.  
-	Operators of all vehicles/equipment shall turn off their engines when the vehicle/equipment is not performing its primary function but no later than five (5) minutes after the equipment is no longer performing its primary function.  
-	Idling for “warm-up” prior to vehicle or equipment operations on UT Arlington property shall be limited to a maximum of five (5) minutes.  
-	Locations where vehicles normally work/idle or are expected to arrive and idle shall have a sign posted that informs the driver of the five (5) minute idling restriction.  
-	Equipment/vehicle associated with UT Arlington construction projects shall limit engine idling to equipment working periods only and only if the availability of the equipment’s function is required as part of an ongoing task.  
-	Vehicles delivering goods and products to UT Arlington controlled construction sites shall be limited to a maximum idle time of five (5) minutes unless the engine is being used to provide power for operation of off-loading equipment. 

Exceptions
The provisions of this policy do not apply to:
-	A motor vehicle that has a gross vehicle weight rating of 14,000 pounds or less and is not an UT Arlington vehicle.
-	Idling when the vehicle/equipment is “queuing” as part of normal operations and procedures; 
-	Operation of the engine for required testing, servicing, repairing, security or diagnostic purposes outside the normal maintenance area;  
-	Idling of the diesel engine to operate equipment necessary to prevent a safety or health emergency or for providing emergency services for which the vehicle was designed; 
-	Idling of the engine when it is directly connected to or providing auxiliary power either as a “power take-off” or equivalent for; 
-	Providing mechanical work functions for which the vehicle or equipment was designed; 
-	Collection or transfer of waste or recyclable materials by an authorized agency or Contractor;  
-	The vehicle is used as a law enforcement of emergency motor vehicle;  
-	The vehicle is idling to defrost a windshield

Enforcement
Failure to comply with this policy will result in a warning for the first violation if operator is unaware of the policy, or if aware of the policy, non-compliance will result in a fine of $25; second violation will result in a fine of $50; and third violation will result in more stringent action to include additional fines and the possibility of removing violator’s vehicle / equipment from the campus.

Any questions or situations related to this policy or requests for exemptions to this policy should be directed to UT Arlington Office of Sustainability at:  (817) 272-9299.

Texas state agencies, including public higher education institutions, are limited in the manner in which they can advocate for issues (Chapter 556.006, Texas Government Code). However, UT-Austin provides policymakers with information on sustainability issues and their potential impacts on the university which permits policymakers to make informed decisions as they deliberate on policy matters. 

At the state level, UT-Austin closely monitors legislation that may impact the university. UT Austin continues to insure that its continuing energy production and efficiency efforts, admissions policies, budget policies and practices meet its core educational mission.  

UT-Austin collaborates closely with other state agencies and governing boards. UT Austin has an exceptional record of collaboration with The University of Texas System Board of Regents and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, and other state agencies on initiatives related to on-campus sustainability. 

UT Austin’s diligence in advancing sustainability issues is evident in its community efforts. Locally, UT-Austin is actively participating on the Pecan Street Project, a $10M multi-jurisdictional initiative promoting renewable district energy infrastructure.

2011-13 - The Sustainable Communities Planning Grant was a three‐year federally funded process to advance implementation of sustainability through regional coordination in the Charlottesville/Albemarle metropolitan area. The University of Virginia served as the project’s consulting participant, serving in an advisory role under the auspices of the Planning and Coordination Council (PACC).
The City of Charlottesville and UVa are currently in pursuit of the Georgetown Energy  Prize and have been shortlisted with 50 other small cities in the United States. The Georgetown University Energy Prize challenges towns, cities, and counties to rethink their energy use, and implement creative strategies to increase efficiency. Currently, the shortlisted communities are leading the way by bringing together their local governments, residents, utilities, and to demonstrate success in reducing energy consumption over a two-year period. 
The University has used several recent stormwater management projects to create wildlife habitat, including stream restoration and stream daylighting to create aquatic wildlife habitat. Wildlife-edible plants and other native plant species are utilized, along with minimally-invasive landscaping practices, to create areas of habitat adjacent to riparian features. Several stream restorations project have implemented strategies to reduce erosion and recreate riffles and pools to create aquatic habitat. Some of the stormwater mitigation projects are joint projects with the City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County.
The University has a representative on both the City and County Planning Commissions, which have both been updating their Comprehensive Plans to improve and integrate sustainable practices into the communities planning practices. 
UVa won a planning grant in 2010 and an implementation grant in 2012 from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) Transportation Enhancement Grant program to develop a bikeshare program on the campus. The bikeshare program - UBike - was implemented in January of 2015 and is now up and running. UVa is one of a few select universities in the United States to have a bikeshare program.
The University of Virginia this month will complete a major bond issuance and related restructuring of its debt designed to support operations and key elements of U.Va.’s strategic plan, including the new Affordable Excellence program adopted by the Board of Visitors in March. Included in the $291.6 million of refunding bonds is the University’s first issuance of “green bonds,” which support environmentally sustainable projects and help to create innovative strategies to meet the goals of U.Va.’s Sustainability Plan. Socially conscious investors bought $97 million in U.Va.’s initial offering of green bonds.
It’s believed to be the largest issue of “green bonds” by a public university to date.
In advance of the financing, all three major credit rating agencies – Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s – reaffirmed the University’s coveted “triple-A” long-term debt rating, a key to U.Va.’s ability to save millions in interest by securing the most favorable terms available to institutions with the top ratings. With this reaffirmation, the University continues to be just one of two public universities in the country to receive “triple-A” ratings from all three major credit rating agencies.
","On a state level, the University is also committed to supporting campus sustainability and advancing sustainability as it relates to environment, economy and equity. Some examples include:
• Through the University’s AccessUVA financial aid program, we are committed to meeting 100% of the demonstrated need of students admitted to the University. This important program allows us to operate with a “need-blind” admission policy that bolsters our efforts to attract the best students to the University while achieving socioeconomic diversity in the student population. The University of Virginia is one of only two public universities in the nation to meet full need for both in-state and out-of-state students
• The University’s recently adopted Affordable Excellence model that ensures that our students will benefit from the University’s residential culture, the advancement of knowledge and service, superior educational experiences, and a new generation of distinguished faculty. At its essence, Affordable Excellence is the University’s commitment that a U.Va. education will remain among the best while guaranteeing that Virginia families will be offered minimum levels of need-based student indebtedness.
• UVa is committed to be a leader in supplier diversity by developing sustainable relationships with qualified, reliable, small, women, and minority owned businesses. We actively seek out the best firms which will enable the University of Virginia to deliver high-quality education, research, public service and healthcare. We offer and participate in multiple diversity training events throughout the year including, but not limited to SWaMFEST, MBE Day, conferences, open houses, etc. to advance and enhance supplier diversity at the University.
• The University also closely monitors legislation, executive orders, and other regulations that are applicable to the University. We engage multiple stakeholders across the University to assess and analyze the impact of legislation, and our Office of State Governmental Relations engages in advocacy efforts on a myriad of issues that will have an impact on the University, either positively or negatively. Issues specific to sustainability include, but are not limited to, energy conservation and reduction initiatives, LEED certification requirements, and storm water management, and affect all state, and sometimes local, agencies and institutions. Given the breadth of these issues, we often work collaboratively with other institutions of higher education and other state agencies as appropriate in our advocacy efforts. 
• A new commission at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center of Public Affairs will examine new ways to fund higher education. The National Commission on Financing 21st Century Higher Education is tasked with searching for new financial models that can sustain colleges and universities while making cost of attendance affordable for all students. The commission also will look at the funding outlook for public institutions before releasing a final report with policy recommendations. The 14-member commission includes two former governors — Mike Castle of Delaware and Bob Graham of Florida — business executives, state legislators, the chancellor of the University of Kansas and the president of Michigan State University. Formal policy recommendations will be released in 2016. 
","The University does not make political contributions/donations (e.g., PACCs, candidates for office, etc.). Per an opinion from the former Attorney General, the state constitution prohibits the use of state funds for private charitable organizations.

That said, advocacy may occur elsewhere within the University consistent with specific academic disciplines of where the office may provide assistance for those advocacy efforts. An example of that occurred this year when Dr. Denise Keele of the Environmental Studies Program, under the direction of the OGA, arranged for a student “lobby day” at the state capitol to address an environmental issue chosen by the students. The 36 students focused on educating state legislators on the potential for a catastrophic oil leak into the Great Lakes from an old oil pipeline running beneath the Straits of Mackinac. Prior to the students going to the state capitol, the OGA provided them with instruction on effective lobbying practices and identification of key legislators. The OGA also provided the students with t-shirts identifying them as WMU students.

The Office of Government Affairs advocacy efforts are centered on securing state appropriations for the University and addressing public policy issues that arise in the state legislative process that can either benefit or harm the efficacy of the institution in meeting its principal directive of meeting the needs of its students. It does not undertake advocacy on behalf of the University on public policy issues that may have merit, but are not directly related to the institution. 

The OGA is working on a funding that will allow the University to have a greater influence on sustainable groundwater management within Michigan. Two years ago the OGA worked to effect legislation that transferred the Michigan Geological Survey to WMU from state government.
