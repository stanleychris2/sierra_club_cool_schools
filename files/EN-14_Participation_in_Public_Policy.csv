Bucknell University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:29:56,delmogaz@bucknell.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The University as an institution does not typically take public policy stances, but instead, facilitates faculty, student, and staff engagement in public policy through the Bucknell Institute for Public Policy and the Bucknell Center for Sustainability and the environment. Sustainability is one of the five tenants of the campus fundraising campaign. This inclusion, as well as the creation of a Presidential Sustainability Council, demonstrate a commitment to Sustainability that is supportive as a broad, social goal. This commitment has not yet been consolidated into support for specific social policies, or with University-level engagement in public policy debates. ",,,http://www.bucknell.edu/PublicPolicy,--
Florida Gulf Coast University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:33:24,kleone@fgcu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"As a publicly funded University, FGCU primarily supports open dialogue about public policy and research efforts to resolve questions affecting decision making rather than to advocate directly for any specific public policy. Nevertheless, through its participation with the State Board of Governors, and regional taskforces and committees, the University does promote sustainability through public policy.  

Eagle Advocates:
Eagle Advocacy is designed to engage the FGCU community to participate in advancing FGCU’s legislative agenda in Tallahassee. The society is designed to connect with people in the community interested in advancing FGCU, communicate with members and keep them up to date on activities of the Florida Legislature, coordinate our community into effective advocacy groups, and activate our members to promote FGCU and our goals to the Legislature and Governor.

Eagle advocates make a difference by persuasively telling the FGCU story and communicating key issues to the all elected officials.  As an eagle advocate, your voice can make a difference to our state legislators and other elected members by providing them with value information at strategic times during the 60-day legislative session and thorough out the year.  With your action and support, Eagle Advocacy will carry a strong message of the importance of higher education and the need for reliable state funding.

Haverford College,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:39:44,ckent@haverford.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Haverford College participates in projects related to sustainability policy advocacy.   The most prominent of these is its Board-level Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility (CISR).  CISR has several responsibilities. Initially, CISR oversaw the decision of total divestment from South Africa, which the College accomplished back in 1987. CISR continued on in the late 1980s and early 1990s to develop policies banning investments in certain types of companies, such as defense and tobacco. As Haverford’s portfolio evolved, the College adopted an indexed approach to managing equities through commingled funds, which removed our capability to vote proxies and restrict portfolio holdings. We decided instead to take a proactive approach, deliberately owning shares of companies that draw substantial stockholder resolution interest because of the nature of their business practices. CISR explores business practices of publicly traded stocks in order to identify firms that engage in business practices contrary to those considered responsible by the broader Haverford community. The stocks of the firms identified are then purchased so that Haverford may express it opinion through proxy voting and may also have the opportunity to participate in sponsoring / co-sponsoring a shareholder resolution in order to effect positive change at these organizations. The current holding sof this portfolio are Apple, Chevron, DuPont, ExxonMobil, GE, McDonalds Tyson Foods and Walmart.",,,--,"At the direction of the CISR, the Haverford Center for Peace and Global Citizenship (CPGC) organized several projects related to sustainability advocacy.  First, the Center, in collaboration with the Department of Economics and Haverford alumni, developed a non-credit seminar on sustainable investing.  This seminar consisted of six two-hour sessions where students, faculty and alumni discussed the theory of sustainable investing using examples drawn from the College and the business community.  Participants met with practitioners (e.g., Haverford’s investment fund manager) and a representative from the Responsible Endowments Coalition (REC), who led a discussion of shareholder activism on college campuses around the country.  In addition, the students participated in an on-line investing simulation using software developed by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.  Participants were given the opportunity to make “investments” using real market data.  At the end of the seminar, the students reported back to the CISR on what they had learned.  The seminar galvanized a small group of students to embrace shareholder activism as a means to express their social justice concerns. 
Building on this initial effort, the CPGC facilitated further contact with the REC to encourage student training in shareholder activism.  This consisted of support for attendance at REC-sponsored conferences, hosting a regional meeting of representatives from other colleges, and a brainstorming session for students and the chair of the CISR to discern student interests related to shareholder activism.  As a result of these efforts, student participation in CISR activities has grown from a small advisory role to one where student interests are driving the issues under the Committee’s care.   "

Oregon State University,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 16:54:36,brandon.trelstad@oregonstate.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"OSU participates in policy issues with one full time professional faculty member dedicated to state policy issues and one full time professional faculty member dedicated to federal policy issues.

As a research intensive institution, and with strengths in forestry, agriculture, natural resources and engineering, OSU faculty and staff serve as experts in their fields and are frequently called upon by elected officials to provide guidance during policy discussions.  OSU has had several scientists serve on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  More locally, a large part of the Oregon spotted owl debate was informed by expertise from OSU via a task force that worked with Vice President Gore and President Clinton in the early 1990s.

OSU, with its land, sea, space and sun grant status and strong background in natural resources and energy issues and has advocated for funding for research in solar, wave and wind energy, bio-based materials, alternative transportation and many other areas.  

Because of its role as a land grant university, OSU advocates for policies that improve the lives of the people of Oregon.  Publicly funded programs advocated for include OSU Extension, Forest Research Laboratories, Agricultural Experiment Stations, Master Recyclers, Master Gardner, Climate Masters, 4H programs, and others. These programs have elements that focus on sustainability throughout the state.  

Most significant with respect to OSU's land grant designation is the policy advice provided through OSU Extension, Sea Grant Extension and other outreach and engagement units.  Local decision making bodies like watershed councils, city councils, county commissions and numerous other entities receive frequent policy advice and direction from Extension and its affiliates. 

OSU is an integral part of the Corvallis community and is one of the largest driving forces for sustainability locally.  OSU is the largest partner in the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition, an organization that advocates for a more sustainable community.  Amongst the work of the Coalition is a Community Sustainability Action Plan that was submitted to and approved by the Corvallis City Council. OSU students in the past few years have also advocated for a Styrofoam ban and plastic bag ban within the city and improved funding of city transit for all of Corvallis.

University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,2016-05-23,2016-05-23 17:03:59,Marianella.Franklin@utrgv.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Higher Education Wrap Up
The 84th Legislative Session’s budget for higher education totaled $17.2 billion for the 2016–17 biennium, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 7.1 percent from the prior 2014–15 biennium (this excludes Higher Education Group Insurance and certain benefits). Budget highlights include: Formula Funding
A win for higher education came in the form of increases in the rate of formula funding for all institutions of higher education. Formula funding for the general academic institutions totals $4.7 billion; UTRGV faired very well, with total general academics formula funding increasing by 9.3 percent.	FACT
The Texas Legislature meets for no longer than 140 days starting at noon on the 2nd Tuesday in January of every odd-numbered year.
 


Medical School
UTRGV’s medical school will receive $30 million in new funds and a transfer of $32.6 million from UTHSC in San Antonio, used in the past to fund the Harlingen and Edinburg Regional Academic Health Centers, and now available to our new School of Medicine.

Graduate Medical Education (GME) received two boosts this session:  3-D rendering of the UTRGV Medical School building on the Edinburg campus.
 
1st with appropriations for FY 2016-17: 
•	GME Expansion - $53 million for expansion of graduate medical education, an increase of $38.7 million from 2014–15;
•	GME Formula - $85.9 million in General Revenue Funds for the GME formula, a $20.2 million increase for the biennium. This results in the formula rate increasing from $5,122 per resident to $6,266 per resident. UTRGV does not yet participate in this formula, but this appropriation is another example of the state’s increased commitment to GME; and,
•	Appropriations provide $4.0 million for the Family Practice Residency program.
Secondly, lawmakers approved the creation of a multi-million dollar endowment that will allow medical schools, teaching hospitals and community based, ambulatory patient care centers to apply for grants to develop new graduate medical education programs with first year residency positions and/or to expand current programs. The goal is to ensure a residency slot for every Texas medical school graduate so Texas can keep its best doctors in the state and attract graduates from other states.
Buildings
The legislature approved $3.1 billion in bonds for construction and renovation projects at 64 public universities, health-related schools and technical colleges. UTRGV is receiving:
•	$36.4 million for a multipurpose academic building in Brownsville, and
•	$30.6 million for an interdisciplinary engineering academic studies building in Edinburg.
Math and Science Academy
More gifted high school students who demonstrate high aptitude in the areas of math and science will be allowed to take classes from college faculty alongside college students and earn up to 60 college credit hours, thanks to a $1 million appropriation to UTRGV for expansion of the current program, a move that will increase STEM opportunities by expanding enrollment and the reach of the program to the entire Valley.

 
Financial Aid
Funding for Texas Grants, the state’s primary financial aid program, is up $62.7 million to $715 million. Eligible students may receive up to $5,000 per academic year. It is expected that with the additional funds 85 percent of eligible students in Texas will receive some aid. At UTRGV, an even higher percentage of students are expected to receive assistance based on need.
 

Aid to Veterans Continues
The Hazlewood Act is a State of Texas benefit that provides qualified veterans, spouses, and dependent children with an education benefit of up to 150 hours of tuition exemption, including most fee charges, at public institutions of higher education in Texas.  Legislation debated throughout the session to scale back the Hazlewood exemption did NOT pass, meaning that the current exemption will remain in place. Under Hazlewood, public universities are required to exempt from tuition, veterans and their spouses, as well as the veteran’s children through a legacy component of the exemption.
While it is a great benefit to veterans and UTRGV supports it, it is largely an unfunded mandate that has grown substantially over the years.
•	UTPA’s Hazlewood obligation rose from $407,831 in 2009 to over $2.5 million in 2014;
•	UTB’s Hazlewood obligation rose from $253,849 in 2009 to over $1 million in 2014; and
•	The Legislative Budget Board estimates total costs will more than double by FY 2019.
Although none of the reforms to Hazlewood passed, the Legislature did address the growing cost of the legacy portion of the exemption, appropriating $53.5 million for statewide Hazlewood reimbursements to both the Veterans Commission and the Permanent Fund supporting Military and Veteran’s exemptions; this included $11.5 million in increased funding for the coming biennium.

Tuition
Several bills were filed to re-regulate tuition, to freeze tuition or only allow it to increase pro rata with inflation, and to tie performance metrics to tuition increases, but all failed to pass.
UTRGV, as a new university, has proposed and the Board of Regents have approved, a tuition structure that, in essence, freezes tuition rates for 4 years, is transparent, eliminates many fees, caps tuition at 12 hours, thereby creating an incentive to graduate sooner and allows students who graduate under 4 years to pay the frozen rate for master’s degree programs should they wish to pursue a master’s.	 

 
Healthcare Districts
Legislation passed that will allow the voters of Hidalgo and Cameron Counties to vote on whether to create healthcare districts in their counties. If passed by the voters of the county, the property tax revenue collected by the healthcare districts would be used to fund indigent care in the counties and support the UTRGV medical school. The maximum tax rate would be capped at 25 cents per $100 in value of the property. The legislation also provides that if the voters approve the measure, the counties must reduce their property tax rate in an amount commensurate with the reduced spending on healthcare because the healthcare district would now provide for those services.

Governor's University Research Initiative (GURI)
At the outset of the 84th Legislative Session, Governor Abbott made university research an emergency item and legislators listened and approved a $40 million fund from which Nobel Laureates and members of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine can be recruited by universities to come to Texas. The GURI will utilize a portion of the Emerging Technology Fund’s unexpended balance to provide matching funds to help public institutions of higher education recruit prestigious, nationally-recognized researchers to their faculty. ","1.This institution recruited a 22 person research team to lead the south Texas Diabetes & obesity institute , which will advance research , develop better treatment and ultimately improve the health of residents in South Texas and beyond . 
2.This institution's  top priority for the 84th Legislative Secession is to assure success of the University of medicine  and to leverage efforts made in the RGV by Health science Center San Antonio .",Not applicable ,https://portal.utpa.edu/portal/page/portal/utpa_main/president_home/president_files/UTPA-Strategic-Plan-Aug20-2012.pdf,--
