On game days, tailgaters are asked to utilize green recyclable bags to collect their bottles, cans and clean cardboard from their tailgating site. Once full, these are left behind and Appalachian State staff collect the bags from the tailgate lots to be recycled. Volunteers assist ASU Recycles staff with the distribution of these bags. In addition, over 75 recycling bins are placed throughout the stadium area on game days, and the recycling left behind in the stadium is also separated out by a contracted clean-up crew as well. ","Education and outreach is one of the keys to the success of this campaign. Through this campaign, we have been able to utilize our volunteers to educate students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community members about the importance of waste reduction, recycling, and sustainability. Not only do our game day volunteers have the opportunity to outreach while distributing the bags, but our student interns have the opportunity to outreach to many classes while recruiting for volunteers. There is also a massive training effort involved with our volunteers prior to game day as well. Before this campaign began, all the recycling from tailgating and the stadium was thrown away. We have diverted over 9 tons of material from the landfill last football season, through over 100 volunteers passing out over 30,000 bags. In addition, we have been able to reach an audience of thousands at every home game. ",http://zerowaste.appstate.edu/special-programs/recycle-rock,Zero Waste,"A “zero waste” commitment has begun at Appalachian State University with the goal of diverting 90 percent of all waste from landfill disposal by 2022.

As part of this commitment, single stream recycling and mini-bin waste collections initiatives will be implemented. These initiatives are a collaborative effort between the Office of Sustainability, Building Services and the Physical Plant.

In keeping with the zero waste commitment of Appalachian, Athletics is partnering with the Physical Plant and Office of Sustainability to develop a zero waste stadium plan, being implemented in the 2014 football season. The stadium game day waste collection will consist of 15 zero waste zones for the collection of compost and recycling throughout the concourse areas. These zones will have ample signage and zero waste attendants at each location to ensure attendees are educated and aware of which container to use when discarding their waste. The group is working with the concessionaires to ensure the products they use are either compostable or recyclable. The condiment areas will consist of bulk condiments rather than individual packets. The clean up of the stadium post game will also work to separate waste for recycling or composting.","The university currently diverts 42 percent of its waste annually from a landfill by recycling, reducing and composting.

An Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) Program has been implemented. Through this program, the university will be required to purchase environmentally preferable products when price and quality are comparable. The development of an EPP work group will involve collaboration of many different stakeholders across campus. One such example of the effects of the EPP program, is the option for EPP ink toners and cartridges (http://materials.appstate.edu/sites/materials.appstate.edu/files/EPP%20Announcement.pdf).

As part of the Zero Waste Commitment the Office of Sustainability published a comprehensive waste audit report in spring 2014 (http://zerowaste.appstate.edu/sites/zerowaste.appstate.edu/files/FINAL%20exec%20summary%20feb%202014.pdf) to be used as a planning tool in identifying potential areas of improvement and as a educational tool for explaining how our current waste-stream is managed. The study concludes that ASU has the potential to divert up to 88% of its waste stream.

The Center for Sustainability and Students Striving for Sustainability (S3) partnered in 2012 to improve the waste diversion infrastructure across campus. Composting and recycling already existed campus wide, so efforts were focused on adding special collections (styrofoam, e-waste, batteries, ink cartridges, and goodwill bins) in every campus building. All trashcans have also been removed from classrooms (with the exception of a few rooms like art studios), to encourage personal responsibility for waste and get us closer to our zero waste goals. More importantly, we focused on achieving zero waste at all major events (using our zero waste team) and educating and training. All staff and faculty have had small, hands-on sorting trainings, and all incoming students received the same training at orientation (except in a ""waste relay"" style). Campus competitions are another important component of our strategy. ","The college has been aggressively working on the zero waste initiative.

The audit included single stand alone bins and cluster bins that appear in a pair next to a recycling bin.  Organized by the Sustainability Department, students conducted the audit, in the middle of campus in the Library Quad for maximum exposure and was directed at students to be a visual learning tool of how their choices of which can to choose can make a big impact.  Signage was used to target student passersby of what was occurring, including categories of content being examined, what the event was and sustainability staff was on hand to answer any questions of students passing by wondering what we were doing. 
Observations:				
					
1. Nearly 20%, or 1 in 5 lbs., of materials discarded in exterior trash cans at Sac State is a recyclable product under current system.

2. Of the material that was ultimately recycled, hard plastics accounted for 43.8%. (Hard Plastics are defined as all plastics 1-7 that were not plastic bags nor liners)

3. The difference of recyclable content thrown away into stand-alone receptacles versus cluster bins is only 1%.

4. A significant portion of the refuse materials (food, soiled napkins, soiled non-coated paper cups, etc.) appeared compostable in nature.

5. Most of the hard plastic gathered appeared to be cold, beverage cups (including lids and straws) and individually portioned snack/meal containers.

6.  Many paper/cardboard materials that may have been unsoiled and thusly, recyclable, may have been soiled by recent rainfall.

","The positive impacts that came of the audit results were a change in the type of signage placed at the recycling and trash bins around campus to help as a educational guidance tool for students as they make a choice as to which bin they will place their items in.  Additionally, the residential Dining Commons has since implemented a pre and post consumer food waste composting program because one of our biggest findings was a great deal of materials in the trash bin could be composted.

Kill-A-Watt, Calvin’s annual Interim student sustainability competition, has come around again, with a wide variety of opportunities for students to focus on caring for creation and conserving resources, as well as a chance to win $200 towards a dorm-initiated sustainability project.

Kill-A-Watt started in 2008 in Bolt-Heyns-Timmer as a competition between floors and since its inception it has grown to implement permanent changes on campus, such as eliminating trays in the dining halls, and is continuing to spark sustainable change across Calvin.

To win the coveted prize money and campus bragging rights, residents can earn points through a variety of different opportunities.

There are a number of campus events to attend, including the documentary “Seeds of Freedom” and checking out the sustainability tables at Knollcrest, both happening on the 22nd.

Lifestyle challenges are another opportunity to rack up points. These challenges come in the forms of limiting electricity, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, giving up driving and many more.

Each challenge has a corresponding amount of points given to students and their dorm based on its difficulty.

At the end of the month, the dorm with the highest amount of points and lowest amount of energy consumption will win the sustainability grant.

To evaluate your sustainability “footprint,” take the DREAM, or Dorm Room Environmental Awareness Movement, quiz, which is found online.

The framework sets interim, near-term objectives for 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2040. The framework was the result of more than a half-dozen meetings by the committee including direct participation by the college president and a faculty member who teaches math and physics. The plan was discussed at two All College Meetings and was passed in March 2013. ","The near-term implementation objectives in the policy are already being pursued by the members of the Campus Committee for Sustainability and the college's director of energy education and management. For example, in 2013 the college began working with ReVision Energy, of Liberty, Maine, to install a total of 195 solar panels on campus and on the college's farms. These panels will provide approximately 6% of the college's annual electric energy needs. Smaller panels on campus and at both farms provide another 1% of our electricity. The college also renewed a contract for the other 93% of electricity we use with Constellation New Energy for electricity and RECs in a bundled package from wind power farms in the Midwest. Also, the college was given an all-electric Ford Focus for students to use in their academic programs that will further reduce fossil fuel use. In 2015-2016, the Campus Committee for Sustainability is revisiting the Energy Framework to develop concrete plans for achieving the many milestones it sets forth. ",http://www.coa.edu/about/environmental-commitment/publications-policies/,Fossil Fuel Divestment,"Students led the charge for the college to divest from fossil fuel investments. This began with student conversations with the administration, a presentation at the Trustee Committee on Investment, and several discussions with the Board. Students, faculty, staff, and trustees worked together on what quickly became a collaborative education, outreach, and action campaign. ",Students first approached trustees about divestment in January 2013. The college passed a resolution to divest from fossil fuels in March 2013 and fully divested its investment portfolio within 24 hours of passing the divestiture resolution. ,http://www.coa.edu/live/news/745-coa-divests,"In winter 2015, student members of the Campus Committee for Sustainability implemented an energy use competition in the dorms. Over the course of one week in February, residents aimed to reduce their electricity use the most, as compared with the previous week. Each day, student coordinators sent progress reports out to the community, along with energy information and energy use reduction tips. Surveys before and after the competition indicated an increase in student energy literacy, while overall reductions in dorm energy use during the week were significant. ",--

Green Mountain College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:55:37,ihrker@greenmtn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,True,Green Mountain Community Income Equity Fund,"While per capita income in the U.S. has risen 90% between 1970 and today, the benefits of increased economic production have not been evenly distributed. Shares received by low and middle-income workers have declined as measured in inflation-adjusted dollars. During the past 40 years, the minimum wage also decreased 11% in real dollars. This has resulted in the greatest income disparity between top
and bottom earners since the Great Depression. It has also created a system of eroding social capital in the U.S. that can be compared to our current ecological crisis.

Green Mountain College by itself cannot influence broad economic factors that have created wide income disparity in the United States. But GMC takes its commitment to social sustainability seriously. To address the problem of income inequity at home, the Green Mountain Community Income Equity Fund (CIEF) was established in 2013 with the support of the College administration. CIEF invites
higher earning workers at GMC to voluntarily contribute funds to benefit other workers in our community who earn less than the hourly livable wage.

The livable wage for a single adult in Vermont is estimated to be between $15.23 and $16.41 per hour. Some full-time employees in the GMC community (including GMC, Chartwells, and CW) make below that income level. By inviting employees earning higher wages or salaries to contribute to a fund that compensates workers earning less than a living wage, the College is making a very real commitment to social sustainability as expressed in the 8-year master plan Sustainability 2020. CIEF also creates an opportunity for members of the GMC community to express values of social sustainability in ways that directly help their neighbors. Participation is voluntary.","The fund has made several payouts in the short time since it was established. In the summer of 2014, the fund distributed approximately $5,500 to eight people. For people making minimum wage or close to it, they received the equivalent of three weeks' additional pay or a 6% bonus.

This campaign usually takes place in the fall, and for the last three years it has corresponded with Halloween. The challenge is coupled with a massive campaign to educate the campus about the importance of energy conservation and techniques for conserving energy. Campaign techniques include
tabling in the student center to educate passing students, staff and faculty, and to challenge them to sign a conservation pledge on a paper cut-out of a light bulb that is then posted publicly on a bulletin board. The night before the competition begins, flameless candles are placed on all the tables in the dining hall and the overhead lights are turned off. A series of events and activities managed by various
departments also help to educate the campus. The sustainability office uses Facebook and Twitter to post daily standings and suggest energy saving techniques. Live updates are also made to a webpage. Finally, the sustainability office produces outreach videos each year.

The Green Cup competition is composed of three separate awards and one overall winner. The houses with best performance in the categories of Participation, Resource Conservation, and Green House Committee will each earn recognition and a cash prize, while the house with the best score overall will win the Green Cup trophy. The competition  culminates with the Earth Day celebration and Green Cup award ceremony in April.

In addition, competitions for undergraduate and graduate students are organized and run by green living programs at Harvard Law School, Harvard Business School and Harvard Housing properties. First year students compete in a Green Goblet competition.","The total average electricity reduction across all 12 houses during the competition period (October 2012 - March 2013) was 3.83% and the winning house had a reduction of 13%. The year before (Oct 2011 - March 2012) the reduction was 4.3% (compared to a rolling 3 year baseline) and the winning house had an electricity reduction of over 16%. 

The annual food waste audit conducted in all houses as part of this program showed a 21% drop since the previous spring, food waste is down 56% since 2005. Food waste in the fall audit was on par with the all time low (fall 2012 - 1.28 oz/person average, all-time-low fall 2011 - 1.22 oz/cap)

For example, a lighting competition was held between three groups located in Harvard’s Chemistry Department to encourage the positive behavior change of turning off lights in a space when unnecessary or not in use.  The Siemens sub-metering system is installed in several newly renovated lab spaces, and allows for data collection directly from the light fixtures in each space by reporting kW usage every half hour. From this data the kWh usage for each space can be determined, facilitating the calculation of costs and greenhouse gas emissions associated with each lab’s lighting while negating the need to setup light tracking data loggers throughout each space.","Combined, the three groups reduced their weekly kWh usage by an average of 38%. The winning group reduced their weekly kWh consumption from lighting by an average of 73.6% from their baseline. If this behavior continues, it equates to an annual reduction of almost 60,000 kWh representing over $7,000 in electricity savings and 20 MTCDE reduction in emissions.

Loyola University Chicago,2016-02-26,2016-02-26 17:50:42,adurnbaugh@luc.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,True,UnCap LUC,"""UnCap LUC"" is a campaign that led to the banning of the sale of bottled water at Loyola University Chicago. In March of 2012, the students voted in favor of ending the sell of bottled water at Loyola and the phase out process started directly after that. The campaign began with eliminating the selling of bottled water at campus stores, followed by school catering services and finally campus vending machines.

Although the use of plastic is a contributor to environmental problems, the primary goal of UnCap LUC campaign is to raise awareness of the social injustices as well as environmental impacts of water privatization.  Water privatization occurs when private businesses develop or are allowed to control public water supplies, and then bottle the water and sell it to the public for a profit.  The issue of water privatization focuses on the product in the bottle, not the bottle itself.  The students felt strongly that water is a basic human right and the University should not support the privatization of this natural resource.  

UnCap LUC has led to the creation of refill stations where individual can refill water bottles, and a map  of the stations for Loyola community to access and review. All incoming freshmen and transfer students are given a reusable bottle during orientation,and are made aware of the campaign.  Reusable bottles are also sold in campus dining stores.

As an added bonus of UnCap LUC, Loyola continues to progress towards being a more  environmentally sustainable campus with the reduction of plastic waste and the associated energy use to bottle and transport water. ","As of December 2012, Loyola had 51 refill stations on its Lakeshore Campus & Water Tower Campuses. They had reduced the usage of 784,365 plastic water bottles. 

Notes: this number was taken from the tracker on each refill station. This number represents anytime the refill station was used to fill a bottle.

In 2013 Oberlin joined the ranks of around 200 institutions nationwide in saving 2,114,844 kWh of electricity and around $250,000 – in addition to 1,681,241 gallons of water. This was the biggest reduction in CCN history thus far.",http://oberlin.edu/ecolympics,Green Office Program,"The recently created (2015) Green Office Program (GOPro) was designed to involve offices in the campus-wide effort to reduce energy consumption and move towards carbon neutrality. 

The impetus for the creation of the Green Office Program is twofold: 1) the acknowledgement that, unlike students, faculty and staff on campus don’t have clear avenues or resources for getting involved with campus sustainability, and 2) because most faculty and staff work on campus 40 hours a week, year-round, and make decisions that have bearing on campus’ footprint, it is critical to involve offices in sustainability efforts.

The program aims to become a new channel to engage faculty and staff in conservation and sustainability activities. It is also an opportunity for offices to take ownership of their role in Oberlin’s commitment to sustainability and be recognized for their efforts.

Our goal is to create a Green Office Program at Oberlin College that: 1) encourages and challenges college faculty and staff offices and departments to engage in sustainability behaviors, 2) engages faculty and staff in sustainability issues, 3) provides networking opportunities to interested faculty/staff, while also breaking down silos to allow collaboration across campus, 4) provides structure for engagement, but also allows for new ideas to emerge from within units, 5) provide sustainability-related professional development opportunities, and 6) recognize offices for their work on sustainability.","At this point, changes made in offices will be self-reporting and impact will be qualitative. The Environmental Dashboard aims to expand our metering into more administrative and academic buildings within the next few years. Once that occurs the results will be more measurable in terms of energy data.

During the fall semester, students living within 44 residence halls on the Penn State University Park Campus participate in an annual week-long energy challenge. For 7 days, students living in residence halls are encouraged to take action to reduce their building's electrical energy usage by following actions that reduce individual energy use. Students are given daily feedback on their buildings kilowatt hour usage per student and per building. 

Student Recycling Challenge
During the spring semester, students living within each residential area participate in the recycling challenge.  The goal of the recycling challenge is to learn which residential area (East, North, South, Pollock, West) will have the least amount of recyclable materials in the trash bins. Waste audits are done in the various halls and the area with the least amount of recyclables in the trash at the end of 7 days wins the challenge.  A trophy is displayed in the common area.   

Students learn about both campaigns from emails by their Resident Assistants. The campaigns are also advertised in the monthly Residence Hall Newsletter ""Stall Stories"" posted in restroom stalls.

No Impact Week
In Spring 2014, Penn State resident students had the opportunity to participate in this one-week experiment in sustainable living, which allowed them to experience the difference lowering their impact can have on their quality of life, their community and their planet. Special events focused on local food, energy use, reducing consumption of bottled water, and recycling. 

Also in Spring 2014, students in 14 East Halls residence buildings competed against each other and over 100 other universities in the Campus Conservation Nationals energy reduction challenge during three weeks in March and April. The challenge is led by Eco-Reps and their captains (students recruited from their halls). ","During the energy challenge, daily kilowatt hours for each residence hall is provided during the challenge week. These numbers are painted on the windows of each common area: East, Pollock, North, West, South.
The energy challenge week has resulted in significant decreases in electrical energy use during the week. All residence halls have building metering systems to track daily, weekly, or monthly electricity usage per building.
During the Spring 2014 Campus Conservation Nationals energy challenge, an online Lucid building dashboard shows 14 Penn State residence halls participating, with energy savings that ranged from a 7.4% reduction to a 1.5% increase, and an average reduction of 3.2%.

A waste audit determines the winning residential area of the recycling challenge.  Recyclable items in the trash bins are taken and weighed daily for a week. During the spring of 2011, East Halls, a first year living area won the recycling challenge after 3 years of the same upperclassmen area winning.

","In 2014, we had 244 Green Team members engaging over 900 non-team members to participate and complete the challenge. Because we cannot measure energy consumption at the sub-building level, we measured the impact via the number of people who took six actions everyday for two weeks. These actions included: turning off lights, computers, appliances and electronics when not in use; putting printers to sleep; taking the stairs; and unplugging coffee makers and other appliances over the weekends. We offered four additional actions that participants could take over the weekends. Prizes were awarded for those who completed all actions for two weeks.

The event is held and organized by the EcoReps every year to promote sustainable living within each of the eleven residential colleges.  The GDI is a three-week event with each week focusing on a certain environmental or sustainable “theme,” namely (1) energy, (2) water, and (3) waste.  Each week, an email is sent to participants with a link to a Google Form.  Participants are expected to fill out short surveys daily which ask them to log certain aspects of their day that pertain to the week’s theme.  For example, during week 1, participants were asked questions pertaining to energy consumption: What is the average thermostat reading in your room, and how many devices or chargers are plugged into your outlets?  During week 2, participants were asked questions pertaining to water consumption: How many loads of laundry did you do today, and did eat red meat today?  Finally during week 3, participants were asked questions regarding their waste production: How many times did you recycle today, and did you use a reusable water bottle today?  
In order to incentivize students to contribute to the GDI, prizes are rewarded to those who participate as well as to the college that does the best at the end of each week. ","Although there is no explicit data that is measured during the GDI, it is known that during the for 2014 competition, approximately 10 percent of all on-campus students participated in the event by tracking environmental and sustainability related measures, namely their water and energy consumption, as well as their waste production.

During the competition, participating schools report recycling and trash data and are then ranked according to who collects the largest amount of recyclables per capita, the largest amount of total recyclables, the least amount of trash per capita and has the highest recycling rate. In recent years, Rice undergraduate students have teamed with students from other institutions in the Greater Houston area on several friendly competitions. Among other events, Rice hosts a clothing recycling event, and an electronics waste drive during the competition. 
The Rice Recyclemania competition is not just aimed at students; rather it is inclusive of all faculty and staff as well.  ","Historically, Rice’s recycling rate has been around 25 percent.  In the first week of the Recyclemania competition, Rice recycled 31 percent of all its trash, thereby demonstrating that the campaign led to a measurable, positive impact on its sustainability performance.  ",--,"Two other notable outreach campaigns at Rice are its (1) bike safety campaign aimed at students, faculty and staff, and (2) FREE-cycling event which is primarily intended for faculty and staff members. 
(1) Bike Safety campaign: In recent years, Rice has become very focused on ensuring the safety and responsibility of the biking community, both on and off-campus.  Specifically in 2009, Rice had a committee dedicated to bicycle safety that wrote and compiled a document offering recommendations to improve bicycle and pedestrian safety on campus.  Since then, Rice has implemented a webpage dedicated to “Bikes at Rice” that offers information on riding responsibly, following biking safety rules, registering bicycles with the Rice University Police Department (RUPD), respecting pedestrians, and following protocol for stolen bicycles.

All members of the campus community are encouraged to participate and evaluate their own waste and recycling habits during this annual competition through activities and trainings offered by Stanford's Office of Sustainability and Peninsula Sanitary Services, Inc (PSSI)/Stanford Recycling Center. For instance, Stanford offers trainings in conjunction with this campaign entitled ""Best Practices in Waste Reduction."" These trainings are eligible for incentives through Stanford's BeWell program.

Stanford operates and maintains hundreds of campus buildings.  While advanced systems ensure these buildings operate efficiently, a critical tool in helping further reduce Stanford’s energy use is the collective action of campus building occupants.  For years, Stanford’s building managers have helped the university realize significant energy savings through the success of programs like the annual Winter Closure and the Cardinal Green Office Program. In partnership with Zone Management and Facilities Energy Management, these efforts were joined under the Cardinal Green Buildings campaign in order to call attention to the great work building leads are doing and to further engage the campus community in sustainability. In 2015, the program not only included the shutdown of building heating and ventilation systems, as well as custodial services, and individual participation from students, staff and faculty to ensure that all appliances and electronics are unplugged during the building curtailment, but had two additional engagement opportunities. A plug load inventory conducted in 2014-15 revealed a number of space heaters on campus, and through the Cardinal Green Buildings campaign owners of those devices were invited to swap them in for a Sustainable Stanford fleece. Stanford calculated that this program offers approximately a one year return on investment. Additionally, lab workers were challenged to chill up their ultra-low temperature freezers from -80 to -70. These targeted programs were intended to engage specific audiences in the campaign. ","The 2015 Cardinal Green Buildings campaign proved to be another success, with 188 buildings representing more than 75% of zoned buildings participating. Of participating buildings, seven increased their participation level either from full exemption to partial participation or partial to full participation.

Additional savings include 1,570 million BTU of thermal energy saved (combination of hot water and process steam savings) and 203,000 ton-hours of chilled water savings. The program was enhanced by pledges from more than 1300 individuals who committed to reducing their personal plug loads and turning off all equipment before the shutdown. For the inaugural Space Heater Swap, 50 people pledged to turn in their space heater for a Sustainable Stanford fleece.

Tufts University,2016-02-25,2016-02-25 15:40:39,tina.woolston@tufts.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,True,Eco-Reps' Zero Waste Challenge,"For several years, the Tufts Eco-Reps have organized the Zero Waste Challenge, a week-long challenge during which participants (both students and employees) are invited to collect everything they don’t recycle or compost in a clear Ziploc bag and carry it around for the week.  The bag should be prominently displayed or clipped onto backpacks or bags.  The exercise helps participants become aware of how much waste they generate and their own habits (e.g. how decision-making is affected when your trash is visible to other and connected to you).

In 2012 and 2013, the week culminated in an event called “Jumbo Mountains,"" during which participants were invited to bring their Zero Waste Challenge bags to the Quad where the Eco-Reps collected and displayed them alongside the piles of trash generated from several residents halls throughout the week.  The contrast between the small amount of waste generated by challenge participants and the comparatively large amount of waste generated in the residence halls demonstrates just how much of a difference being conscious of your consumption and waste can make.  
","Participation in the Zero Waste Challenge appears to be on the rise if the number of bags brought to the culminating Jumbo Mountains event is any indication. Out of 200-250 bags distributed to both students and staff, around 40 bags were brought to the Jumbo Mountains event in 2012, and the number increased to 65 bags in 2013. We estimate that a majority of participants couldn't bring their bags to the culminating event due to schedule conflicts, but most of those who received a bag participated throughout all or part of the challenge.

Other indicators that the Tufts community has become more waste-conscious over time is the steady decline of Total Waste (Trash + Recycling) generated by the Medford, Boston, and Grafton campuses since 2010, from 4,621 tons in 2010 to 3,685 tons in 2013. The Eco-Reps' composting program in the residence halls measured 1,500 lbs in the fall of 2013 alone, and an upcycling program with TerraCycle brought in over 20 lbs of snack bags and granola bar wrappers in the same time period.",http://sustainability.tufts.edu/zero-waste-challenge/,BYOP (Bring Your Own Placesetting),"In order to reduce waste at the annual President's Picnic held on Tufts' Medford campus at the start of each summer, the Office of Sustainability encourages individuals to BYOP - Bring Your Own (reusable) Placesetting.  Attendees are notified of the initiative through communications, including emails from the President's Office, leading up to the picnic.

At the event itself, attendees who BYOP are eligible to receive sustainability-themed prizes for participating, such as reusable snack plates to bring to future events.  The offices or departments with the most attendees to BYOP are also awarded grand prizes, such as glass water pitchers and potted plants. 

The campaign, which was held during FY12, FY13, and FY14, contributes to the overall goal of making the picnic a zero waste event, in which everything is either composted or recycled and nothing is thrown away.

As one of the largest annual campus-wide events for Tufts employees, the picnic provides an important opportunity to increase the visibility of Tufts' waste reduction efforts and show the community what a zero waste event looks like.  The Office of Sustainability complements the zero-waste efforts at the picnic undertaken by the Tufts Recycles program and the BYOP campaign by educating Tufts employees and other community members about additional sustainability programs and resources available at the university.","Participation in the BYOP campaign at the President's Picnic has increased with each passing year, with increasingly more individuals and offices bringing their own dishes and utensils to the event instead of using disposables.

This campaign has advanced the efforts facilitated by the Tufts Recycles program to make the event zero-waste.

In 2014, an outreach campaign was directed at employees entitled the ""Green Purchasing Project"". This project was funded by the UA Green Fund Committee and is designed to inform campus staff about sustainable product options in office supply ordering. Students personally met with staff purchasers to inform them of greener options through the online ordering system, AZ BuyWays. In its first few months of operation, based on FY '14 data, the project encouraged more than five buildings on campus to increase green purchasing by over 5%. 

Project successes were largely driven through its integration with metrics supplied by the Office Depot ""shades of green"" system for codifying sustainability products and tracking purchasing impacts.  As Office Depot has been acquired by another company, this shades of green system is no longer available.  As a result, the Green Purchasing Project is shifting gears moving forward to partner with campus units such as the Student Unions on deeper engagement in green purchasing decisions in support of university waste reduction goals. ","In its first year of programming (from FY13 to FY14), working with the Residence Life purchasing officers, the program increased ""green spend"" by 3% from 45% to 48%.  Improvement, but only slight.  However, the darkest green spend (e.g. for paper, 100% recycled content) went from 1% to 14%, the mid-green spend (e.g. for paper, 30-50% recycled content, certified sustainable virgin content) went from 17% to 13%, and light green (e.g. for paper, 30% recycled content, 70% virgin content) went from 27% to 21%.

Launched in 2010, Residence students compete house-to-house over a two to three week period in November to achieve the greatest energy savings in their residences or gain the most participation points.

Using an energy conservation dashboard, students track their building’s energy use, make daily conservation pledges and engage in social media and outreach activities.

Students save energy during the Aim to Sustain competition by:
•	Turning out lights in residence rooms and common areas
•	Unplugging electronic devices when not in use
•	Installing power bars to reduce phantom power
•	Washing clothes in cold water and hanging them to dry
•	Taking shorter showers to reduce hot water use
•	Turning down the heat
•	Taking the stairs, and avoiding power-consuming elevators

Activities and resources to promote these behaviors include:
•	Dine in the Dark – a ‘lights out’, dining experience in the residence dining halls
•	Outreach booths which promote energy and water conservation tips
•	Public commitments made by students on how they will conserve water or energy
•	Acoustic music nights
•	Energy conservation prompts placed around the residences such as shorter shower posters and timers, take the stairs poster, cold water laundry posters, lights out and power management signs","The measured impact of this campaign for the Totem Park Residence, which has real-time energy meters installed at the residence house level, is:

Over 200 researchers — staff, faculty and students -  formed 50 teams and competed for two $500 awards, the Grand Prize and the Spirit Challenge, as well as weekly draws for each building, worth $100 each.","Altogether, the participating lab groups in the 2014 Shut the Sash competition achieved an 81 per cent improvement in average sash height. Teams helped to save an estimated 29,500 kWh of electricity, 915 GJ of steam, $7,272 in carbon offset & utility costs, and reduced GHG emissions by 46 tonnes - equivalent to 27 round trip flights from Vancouver to St. John’s Newfoundland.

In the 2013 and 2012 competitions, participating labs saved an estimated 134,000 kWh of electricity and 3,000 GJ of natural gas, and reduced GHG emissions by 130 tonnes—equivalent to 78 round-trip flights from Vancouver to St. John’s, Newfoundland.",http://sustain.ubc.ca/campus-initiatives/green-research/shut-the-sash,,--

During the 10-week contest, UC faculty, staff and students were challenged to take steps to reduce their carbon footprints using an online tool to track their activity and earn points for their campus. Modeled on the Cool California Cities Challenge, which gives Californians the tools they need to take action to protect the climate and keep California cool, the Cool Campus Challenge focuses on actions that individuals can take to put their campus on track to reach carbon neutrality.","Over 19,000 University of California students, staff and faculty came together in the fall to take action against climate change. Together, the UC community pledged to take steps that will save over 20 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions annually. That’s equivalent to each of us taking nearly 2,000 cars off the road for a year!",http://www.coolcampuschallenge.org/,Green Department Grand Slam,"The Green Department Certification Grand Slam program meets the reporting standard for Innovation credits. 

The Green Department Certification Grand Slam builds on the existing program, but uses an innnovative approach to try to double participation.  There is evidence that the amount of work needed to complete the checklist and the lack of student assistance has limited how many and how quickly departments can participate.  It is also possible that the open-ended nature of the certifications – with no deadlines or set timeframes – has meant that some department green teams have lost focus.  In order to directly address both of these constraints, this year the Office of Sustainability implemented a new process of certification that included student liaisons between campus departments and the Office of Sustainability and also set an end of the year deadline for a department to be certified.  The establishment of Green Teams with students, faculty, and staff has provided a unique opportunity for collaboration within the campus and has increased awareness and understanding of sustainability issues.

Students are taking the lead on helping 10 departments succeed in getting certified under a new and more challenging set of criteria.

In the fall of 2015, over 19,000 participants took up the on-line gamified challenge to reduce their personal and campus carbon footprints, including students, staff and faculty from all 10 UC campuses as well as the UC Office of the President. The challenge included 37 different pledges, targeting actions anyone can take on an everyday basis to reduce their energy and carbon footprint from lighting, computer use, purchasing, heating and cooling, and transportation.","The following are some illustrative results: 
• Exceeding expectation, over 19,000 UC people joined in on the inaugural Cool Campus Challenge, with students and staff participating with enthusiasm. That’s about 5% of the whole UC system. 
• Together Challenge participants will reduce 20 million of pounds of carbon emissions each year with their new actions. That is equivalent to taking 2,000 cars off the road or 4,700 California homes installing solar or 800,000 gallons gasoline saved.
• The UC carbon reducing collective action grew–across the system 450 teams came together to challenge each other to knock back emissions. And, we appreciated each other – 2,500 carbon hero nominations were submitted ranging from inspiring staff implementers, to student leaders, to faculty mentors.
• Creativity and communication about the Carbon Neutrality Initiative abounded on social media and through campuses outreach efforts. 1,600 posts were made to #UCool.
• UC Leadership engaged from President Napolitano, to Chancellors, to Deans and to student leadership.
• We inspired others globally - Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme and Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations highlighted the Cool Campus Challenge at the UC Climate Summit at UC San Diego .
• All the campuses and UCOP made amazing efforts for which all are recognized.
• At UC Davis, the Facilities, Operations and Administration division (the business units of the university) formed a team with 151 members and racked up CO2 reductions of 1,256,000 pounds, and the UC Davis Library (which includes several separate physical libraries around campus) formed a team with 75 members, racked up 465,044 pounds of CO2 reductions and used the power of the experience to launch an on-going green team.

(1) Waste Less Winter Quarter
(2) Waste Less Winter Quarter reinforces existing education and waste reduction programs through tabling and awareness talks. Waste reduction interns spent the first month updating signage in each of the units ensuring signs are posted in the front and back of the house detailing our compost, recycling, and waste reduction programs. During the second month, interns tabled in each of the Dining Commons encouraging students to use Just Ask and Try- a- Taste to reduce food waste. Throughout the quarter, Dining Services management discusses “Waste Talks,” spending five minutes during weekly huddles to discuss our waste reduction programs.
(3) Since the beginning of the quarter, our waste audit results revealed that we reduced our post consumer waste by .11 oz per meal per person, a 5% reduction.

(1) Resident Garden Parties
(2) Once a month, our Resident Garden Team hosts a “Garden Party” at the Resident Garden at Segundo. This is a first-year student resident living area in which Student Housing, Campus Center for the Environment and Dining Services collaborate to offer first year students access to try gardening. The monthly garden parties serve to increase participation by bringing students to the garden with activities (i.e. seed saving, pest management workshops) and refreshments. The goal is to increase our “Blue” and “Gold” Gardeners, students who regularly visit during the week to gain experience and be able to garden on their own. 
(3) The Resident Garden Parties have led to an average of 30 new “Blue Gardeners” and 2 new “Gold Gardeners” per quarter. Once a student has gardened alongside an experienced student intern ten times, they gain “Gold Gardener” status. The average attendance of the garden parties is 10-20 students.

(1) Aggie Grown, Resident Garden and Waste Reduction Outreach
(2) Each month, our Aggie Grown and Resident Garden Teams table in each of the DCs during one meal period to raise awareness about respective opportunities for students. The Aggie Grown Team recruits students to volunteer at the Student Farm and hosts activities to engage students such as, “Get to know your Greens,” a Student Farm produce identifying game. The Resident Garden Team recruits students to utilize the garden and engages through tea bag making and seed starting, for example. 
(3) Resident Garden outreach has led to increased participation in Garden Parties and in turn weekly gardening opportunities for student residents. 

(1) Meatless Monday Campaign
(2) Meatless Mondays is an annual campaign to demonstrate to students what their vegetarian and vegan options are in Resident Dining and to gain 1,000 pledges from students to try leaving out meat one day a week for their health and the health of the planet. We table 6-8 times a year as part of our Healthy Planet, Healthy Me! Program. At the end of the academic year, we invite students who have pledged to join us in the DC for a coconut ice cream party and add up the total savings in environmental impact of all of those who pledged to demonstrate to students the power of their food choices. 
(3) Meatless Mondays impact for 2011-2013, based on virtual resources saved from meals eaten without meat over one academic year:
Total Meatless Monday Pledges = 859.0
CO2 total (tons of CO2) = 119,401.0
CO2 total (equivalents to trash bags full) = 178,672,000.0
H2O total (gallons) = 39,754,520.0
H2O total (football fields, 1cm deep) = 3,375.9

",(see above; measured impacts included with each element of Dining Services education and outreach campaigns),http://dining.ucdavis.edu/sustainability.html,"Full Campus Outreach Campaign:
(1) Cool School Awareness Campaign 
(2) In late summer 2012, UC Davis was informed by Sierra magazine that the campus had been named the 2012-13 #1 Cool School for its sustainability achievements. The campus knew this was a unique opportunity to communicate about sustainability. The office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability worked in very close partnership with the office of Strategic Communications to create an awareness campaign for the duration of the award. The campaign was designed to meet three key goals: 1) increase awareness across a wide swath of audiences about campus sustainability achievements; 2) encourage the adoption and continuation of sustainable behaviors and practices; and 3) generate school pride around the #1 ranking and the sustainability achievements that won that ranking. The campaign was about 10 months long, utilized a wide variety of outreach methods from traditional means to more unusual and creative means, and deliberately sought out collaborative, partnership-based, and resourceful opportunities. The campaign was run with a slim budget, with money allocated to hire a recently graduated student to be the project coordinator, and for some limited collateral and communication materials, such as banners and postcards. The 5 other core team members’ time was absorbed in their offices’ budgets. At the 2013 California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, the campaign was awarded the Best Practice Award for Communicating Sustainability. Core lessons from the campaign include:
+ Pull together a small team in order to get a lot done, create and innovate quickly, and hold each other accountable
+ Make a communication/marketing plan, but not too detailed or rigid of a plan so that the campaign can seize opportunities that arise and reallocate resources quickly
+ Define a consistent visual look. Stick to it.
+ Partner, collaborate, and share opportunities every chance you can. Ask for what you want, others may be able and willing to help. Find ways to make you and your partners both shine.
+ Capitalize on existing resources; be scrappy.
+ Let a limited budget be a source of creativity; avoid costly “opportunities”
+ Have fun, be open, stay flexible
+ The medium cannot undermine the message: Source any materials or products sustainably, even when it’s hard and expensive.
(3) The campaign assessed messaging success through a variety of metrics. We used bitly links to track engagement with our communication materials and could see which materials were getting the most scans and at what locations on campus. At the end of the school year we created a short Google survey and asked one question, “Why do you think UC Davis is the #1 Cool School?” The survey was distributed through various campus social media outlets and the campus email and online newsletter. 68% of our respondents chose the answer, “UC Davis was ranked the “Coolest School for its sustainability efforts.” The survey helped us get a sample of the number of campus community members that we reached. Sales data from our campus bookstore was very positive, of the Cool School products ordered, over 80% of it was sold during about a three month time period.

Employee Outreach Campaigns: 

(1) Back of the House Waste Audits
(2) One time each month, our two student Waste Reduction Coordinators visit our three Dining Commons and two retail hubs (Scrubs, Silo) to check the waste stream diversion in each unit. Units are not warned in advance. The students check through the compost, recycling and waste receptacles in each production area, as well as look as much as safely possible into our dumpsters and compactors, to determine whether the production teams in each unit are properly sorting their waste. They are also checking to make sure that we are using the proper disposable materials to minimize waste and that all waste education/signage is correct in the units. If the student coordinators find any misplaced waste, they discuss with the staff on duty to foster proper waste diversion understanding. Each unit receives a score based on a scale of 1-10, and the winning retail and resident dining units receive a trophy each month. At the end of the year, the unit with the most trophies wins a grand prize. 
(3) Each year, the units’ waste diversion accuracy increases from the beginning of fall quarter, demonstrated by improved scores during the audits in each unit. This is also demonstrated by seeing consistently positive results in our waste diversion overall as well as positive feedback from the services that process our waste. 

(1) Sustainability Talks
(2) Sustainability Talks are biweekly newsletters distributed to the Directors of each unit to go over with their teams during “team huddles” before each meal period. The focus this quarter was on waste reduction, including topics such as “Just Ask” and “How to Sort your Waste,” which seek to build knowledge among staff on our waste reduction programs. These Sustainability Talks are also intended to educate staff on sustainable food issues outside of our immediate campus, such as how a Biogas digester works, and information on the local farms that we work with. 
(3) We distributed buttons for staff to wear along with our most recent Waste Talk to encourage a program called “Just Ask” in which we try to create more communication between students and front-line staff to customize dishes and limit post-consumer food waste. We found that the Directors’ and staff support of this Waste Talk could be seen by the number of staff who we see wearing the buttons and supporting the program, without us having to individual trainings. 

(1) Green Workplace
(2) The UC Davis Green Workplace program provides individuals with achievable steps toward a greener workplace and celebrates their accomplishments. By participating, departments and research group:
Save resources and money
Improve re-use of supplies and equipment, as well as reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact
Build community relationships
Be recognized for sustainability efforts and promote this work among colleagues
The program includes three ways to participate:
Green Leaf: An individual can earn a green leaf for themselves and their own desk.
Green Office: An administrative unit can earn a certificate for their collective everyday practices. Personal and group actions are added together.
Green Lab: A research group can earn a certificate for their everyday practices in the lab.
For each type of participation, Leaf, Office, or Lab, participants complete sustainability checklists, learn tips for improving their sustainability scores, and have opportunities to complete sustainability activities with their co-workers.
(3) Currently there are approximately 400 employees in the Green Office program and approximately 200 employees in the Green Laboratories program. We have over 35 Green Leaf champions, four Green Office champions, and three Green Lab champions. Many staff are eager to join the program and offer additional training to their units. For example, one Green Champion hosted a Green Office Expo on behalf of her department and another has volunteered to do outreach at a tabling event.

Students can see directly how much food is wasted in a single meal period. Green Captains also provide students with simple tips to reduce food waste and celebrate successes when students come to the bins with no waste. By letting students see the impact, educating them with steps they can take to reduce waste, and engaging them through activities and incentives (such as a bonus themed meal), this campaign successfully reduces post-consumer waste. Additionally, through feedback gathered during events about portion sizes and taste and texture, we are able to alter our food preparation to reduce waste by increasing customer satisfaction and to ensure recipes are followed correctly. This involves educating employees about how better preparation can also reduce waste.

*UCI Hospitality & Dining identifies student employees who are passionate about sustainability to be Green Captains each year. Green Captains are responsible for implementing practices designed to reduce the environmental impact of campus dining locations and for educating students through events about environmental sustainability and UCI Hospitality & Dining.","Waste per person has continued to decrease each year, as follows:
October 2012: 2.42 ounces per person average post-consumer solid food waste.
October 2013: 1.7 ounces per person
October 2014: 1.44 ounces per person.
October 2015: 1.31 ounces per person.

The Green Captains at Panda Express work within the location to promote the importance of this practice to other employees in reducing waste at the source.","Prior to the campaign, all customers were given bowls or to-go containers. No plates were used previously at the location, so all plate use is attributed to the success of the campaign. Plate use increased as employee buy-in was established, customer-facing signage was developed, and the message to customers was refined to focus on the environmental benefits of choosing a plate. Plate use increased over three weeks from 450 plates per week during the pilot week to more than 800 plates per week, diverting 1.78 Metric Tons of Carbon Equivalent per academic quarter (10-week period).",http://uci.campusdish.com/Sustainability/WhatWeAreDoing.aspx,"On Dec. 15, 2015, the University of California announced that UCI placed first among UC schools participating in Cool Campus Challenge, a 10-week contest aimed at helping to make UC campuses carbon neutral by 2025. Despite some nail-biting moments at the finish, UCI held onto its lead with participation of some 4,000 staff, faculty and students completing tasks to amass points. The Cool Campus Challenge is part of UC President Janet Napolitano’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative. During the contest, UC faculty, staff and students were challenged to take steps to reduce their carbon footprints using an online tool to track their activity and earn points for their campus.

UC Irvine actively encourages students to participate in RecycleMania, a friendly, national competition among colleges and universities to determine which institutions have the best recycling programs. Of more than 390 colleges and universities that participated in the competition in 2015, UCI placed 7th in the Grand Champion category, which measures the highest recycling rate for overall waste generation, and 6th in the Gorilla category, which measures the highest gross tonnage of combined paper, cardboard, bottles and cans, regardless of population. This is the fourth year in a row that UCI has placed in the top 10. UCI completed the eight-week springtime competition with a 74.74% overall recycling rate.

By engaging staff and faculty in a voluntary program, we can promote sustainable behavior across the campus, make greater strides toward our sustainability goals, and strengthen our position as a leader in sustainability.
First, workplace's complete and electronically submit an online self-assessment of the current office conditions and practices.  Once submitted, an OCS Sustainability Representative meets with the team onsite, reviews the checklist, and answers questions. Areas in which there is room for improvement receive special attention in order to overcome any barriers and develop an action plan for improvement.  Based on the points earned, the office is then given a rating to determine if they qualify for being a Sustainable Workplace. OCS provides recommendations and technical assistance to help implement best practices and make the largest positive environmental impact feasible. The office then receives a packet of resources including informational handouts and signage for use in the office. In addition to ongoing technical assistance, workplaces committed to reducing their environmental footprint through the Sustainable Workplace Program are recognized with the award of a certificate, a Sustainable Workplace digital logo for web and print use, and placement on the Sustainable Workplace webpage.",Over 50 offices have participated since implementation & their final ratings can be seen at the webpage listed below.

The competition is run by a partnership of the College and University Recycling Coalition (CURC), RecycleMania, Keep America Beautiful (KAB) and EPA’s WasteWise program.
During the challenge, colleges and universities implement waste reduction programs during home football games. Schools track and report waste reductions and disposal data that is used to rank the schools.","Reducing Raiders
Results from Game Day Challenge are in! The University of Mount Union competed against 60+ schools in the nation competing in four different categories including: waste minimization (pounds of waste per person); recycling (pounds recycling per person); diversion percentage (amount of waste diverted from landfill); and greenhouse gas reduction (Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent per person). We did not compete in the other category, organics (pounds of organics per person).

Waste Minimization 6th out of 62 (0.134 lbs per person)
Compared to 62 other schools in the nation the University of Mount Union places 6th in generating the least amount of waste (recycling and trash) per person at football games. Congratulations Raiders for only producing 0.134 pounds per person in trash and recyclables on Saturday November, 9th home football game and following the “reduce first, reuse, then recycle” slogan.

Recycling Rate 52 out of 67 schools (0.071 pounds per person) 
The University of Mount Union’s recycling rate (pounds recycled per person) was 52 out of 67 schools with 0.071 pounds recycled per person at Game Day Challenge. This could mean two things 1) we didn’t generate a lot of recyclable materials so kudos to all the fans for using their reusable water bottles, mugs, bags and reusing items before recycling them and 2) we can always improve our recycling rate at the games by continuing to improve materials in the stadium and tailgating areas making sure they are recyclable.

With a total of 12 volunteers and a total of 54.5 volunteer hours, the Green Raiders and volunteers feel confident that we were able to capture most of the recyclable materials at our home football game (other than items that had been contaminated by food). During tailgating, the volunteers, identified by green bandanas, were handing out recycling and trash bags in the tailgating areas, talking with fans, and during the game patrolled the stands and trash and recycling bins. All trash and recycling was weighed by hand which was totaled and then submitted to Game Day Challenge. The University of Mount Union Baseball team did the final stadium clean-up taking the two truckloads of trash and recycling to our recycling and trash containers and cleaning the stadium by hand using blowers to collect the remaining waste.

Diversion Rate 29th out of 61 schools (We divert 53% of our waste from the landfill). 
Our diversion rate of 53% shows us that we could divert more of our waste from the landfill placing 29th out of 61 schools. At Game Day Challenge we recycled 53% of our materials and the rest of our waste (47%) is send to the landfill. We can improve our diversion rate (and improve the amount of greenhouse gases we are able to reduce) by finding solutions to food waste and continuing to work on improving the materials in the stadium and tailgating areas ensuring they are either recyclable or compostable.

Results in GRAND CHAMPION category are calculated using the following equation:
weight of recyclables + food organics / (weight of recyclables + food organics + trash) X 100 = recycling rate (%)

Results in PER CAPITA CLASSIC category are calculated using the following equation:
weight of recyclables / campus population (FTE students and staff) = lbs. / person

Results in WASTE MINIMIZATION category are calculated using the following equation:
weight of recyclables + food organics + trash / campus population (FTE students+staff) = lbs. / person

As a campus-wide campaign, RecycleMania includes the entire student body, faculty, and staff. Beginning each February, the competition lasts for eight weeks. Every week, competing universities and colleges are ranked within their respective states in categories such as bottles and cans, paper, cardboard, and waste minimization. During the competition, the Office for Sustainability holds outreach events: a student-driven waste audit to promote recycling awareness and education, an e-waste recycling event for the campus community, and prizes to students using reusable mugs and reusable to-go containers.

Campus Conservation Nationals is a nationwide electricity and water reduction competition on college and university campuses. Institutions strive to achieve the greatest amount of energy reduction within their student residence halls over a three week period between February and April. The University of Richmond measures energy consumption using Lucid Building Dashboards. To generate enthusiasm about the competition, student energy ambassadors speak to the students living in residence halls about the competition and how to use the energy dashboard.

To launch the Campus Conservation Nationals and RecycleMania campaigns, a model residence hall room was created. The model room was equipped with numerous items exemplifying how easy it was to become personally sustainable. Some of these items included environmentally friendly products, a drying rack, CFL light bulbs, and organic cotton sheets. At the kick-off event, students were asked to pledge their participation in the competition and to sign up for the Green Room Program. 
","Both RecycleMania and Campus Conservation Nationals foster behavior change by educating students about recycling and personal energy consumption reduction. Positive, lasting impacts can be seen by comparing RecycleMania results from 2013 and 2014. In 2013, the recycling rate was 10.4% and 8.573lb/capita. In 2014, the recycling rate was 26.98% and 22.723/capita. The improvements in these various categories show recycling and waste reduction improvements on campus. 

We participate in Campus Conservation Nationals with a goal of reducing campus residence hall energy consumption. For the 2015 competition, the Office for Sustainability has included the University Forest Apartments which house many of the upperclassman residents. The apartments are individually metered, so students collected data weekly from the meters. 

Beyond recycling rates and energy conservation, the leadership and education opportunities presented by the competitions pay great dividends. Student volunteers spread awareness about Dorm Wars, conduct a public waste audit to educate students on waste diversion opportunities, and hold an E-Waste collection event for personal electronics. They also hosted a clothing swap and Building Captains reached out to their peers living in their dorm. The organizational and even planning skills required to make these events a success are transferable to many career needs.

Williams College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 08:24:29,mae3@williams.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,True,Winter Blitz,"This student-run project engages students and community volunteers to weatherize a total homes in 3 towns near Williams College during a one-day event in November. Students caulk, install weather stripping, insulate hot water pipes, provide and install energy efficient bulbs, and sometimes even rake the leaves. The goal of the project is to help low-income homeowners prepare for the winter through making their homes more comfortable and energy efficient, promote community ties, and provide students with an opportunity for learning skills and engaging in community efforts.","Since its inception in 2008, students and volunteers have weatherized hundreds of houses of low-income and elderly neighbors, which has made a significant impact on the comfort of the homeowners and also increased the energy efficiency of their homes and subsequently saved them money on heating and cooling costs.",--,Bus with Us,"Williams is partnering with the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority (BRTA) in multiple pilots to expand bus service between Williamstown, North Adams and Pittsfield.  Williams students (and employees) can ride FREE (when showing Williams ID) as they travel to volunteer, work, shop or just explore the Route 2 and Route 7 corridors into North Adams and Pittsfield! See the pilot specifics below. For bus schedule information, go straight to the BRTA website at berkshirerta.com.

If ridership keeps increasing, we will be able to make the case for more and better service in our region. Students, faculty and staff can help by taking the bus often and providing feedback, both on this site and in person to the “Bus with Us” planning group.  Help us move quickly up the learning curve and double our ridership by the end of this year!  Check this site and WSO for updates, promotions and other ways you can help.","Increased ridership, not only among students and employees but also among community members by increasing service.",http://learning-in-action.williams.edu/buswithus/,,--
Worcester Polytechnic Institute,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 14:52:55,ltomasz@wpi.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,True,Annual Waste Stream Audit,"Annual Waste Audit engaged student, staff, and faculty volunteers to sort trash in selected buildings to determine effectiveness of waste minimization and recycling efforts, and whether the campus has improved its overall performance. ","The Annual Waste Audit in 2014 showed where increased efforts are necessary to increase our recycling rate. Possible problems with the system were identified. For example, we noted locations where more of certain materials were thrown out, indicating a potential need for more recycling bins in those areas. A general per capita consumption per building was also identified. ",http://www.wpi.edu/Images/CMS/Sustainability/2014_WPI_Waste_Audit.pdf,The Sustainability Pledge Drive,Green Team members educate members of the WPI community about simple strategies to reduce their environmental impact and asks them pledge to follow these strategies by signing a banner that is hung in the Campus Center. ,"After the pledge drive last year, a banner (the size of a bed sheet) was full of signatures of those students and faculty who pledged to integrate some part of sustainability into their lives. At the most recent pledge event, approximately 75 students signed the pledge banner. ",http://www.wpi.edu/about/sustainability/ourini815.html," The Green Team partners with the institution to host a yearly Electric and Fuel Efficient Vehicle Show that is open to the WPI community and Worcester community members improving visibility of fuel efficient vehicles.. Student and Staff Eco-Reps train with WPI Facilities and Waste Management to work with peers to improve recycling, resulting in better recycling results. ",--
