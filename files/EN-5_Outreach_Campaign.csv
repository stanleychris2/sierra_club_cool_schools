Over an 8-week period each spring, colleges across the United States and Canada report the amount of recycling and trash collected each week and are in turn ranked in various categories based on who recycles the most on a per capita basis, as well as which schools have the best recycling rate as a percentage of total waste and which schools generate the least amount of combined trash and recycling.  With each week’s updated ranking, participating schools follow their performance against other colleges and use the results to rally their campus to reduce and recycle more.",Recylemania has resulted in the cumulative GHG reduction of 237 metric Tons of CO2.,http://www.recyclemaniacs.org/scoreboard/participating-schools/list?geo_aa=PA&node_id=10464,"During the past three years, Bucknell Communications has created specific outreach campaigns, directed at all members of the campus community, to encourage recycling and power shut-offs during breaks.",--

Over a 10-week period, schools report recycling and trash data which are then ranked according to who collects the largest amount of recyclables per capita, the largest amount of total recyclables, the least amount of trash per capita, or have the highest recycling rate. With each week’s reports and rankings, participating schools watch how their results fluctuate against other schools and use this to rally their campus communities to reduce and recycle more.”

RecycleMania is entirely student run being organized and managed by the Student Government’s Executive Cabinet Director of Environmental Initiatives with a host of student volunteers. 
","FGCU has participated in Recyclemania since 2010.  Their final results by year are as follows:
2014-placed 31st out of 256 with a cumulative recycling rate of 47.608%

Recycling Campaign,"The county switched from multiple stream to single stream recycling.  Student volunteers stood at the entrance of campus during busy morning waving banners with All Together Now!  Campus-wide messages were sent out, monthly staff trainings were conducted, weekly cross campus meetings were held to address common concerns and obtain feedback, speakers presented the information to environmental professors to share in their classes, 3-D YES and NO boards were created by student volunteers, tabling events were staffed by student volunteers to educate staff and students.  New signage was created, multiple sets of recycle and waste bins were placed in every building on every floor across campus.  ","The overwhelmingly positive response to the simplified recycling requirements lead to increased compliance.  The municipal waste removal contractor was pressed to accommodate our larger quantity of recyclable materials.  FGCU is the only entity in Lee County that has 30-yard dumpsters retrofit to take commingled recycling.  FGCU now has an exterior footprint of 55% recycling capacity to 45% waste capacity. Since this is the first year of single stream activity, we will use the results from RecycleMania 2014 as our baseline to measure the success of the All Together Now! campaign.  Preliminary feedback from across campus has been enthusiastically supportive and awareness is certainly much higher as to the importance of reuse of materials, recycling what can be and reduction of overall waste.",http://www.fgcu.edu/PhysicalPlant/fgcu-recycles.html,"TREE CAMPUS USA
Tree Campus USA held a Campus Beautification Day in conjunction with the Staff Advisory Counsel, staff was invited to come to campus on a Saturday to plant butterfly gardens.  The area selected was within and around the Tree Orphanage, an area that trees are saved from construction projects, where they now provide a shaded area for staff and students to gather.  325 plants were planted by staff, faculty and student volunteers, students naturals provided information about the unique natural environment of southwest Florida, planting techniques and other opportunities to get out on campus nature trails. 

MOVE-OUT 
FGCU's Move-Out Campaign is another noteworthy outreach program that yields measurable, positive results in advancing sustainability.  This campaign encourages students, ""DON'T DUMP, DONATE!""  The Office of Residence Life works to educate students during the Green Eagle Fair and by disseminating information through the RA's and in the Residence Halls bulletin boards throughout the year.  The campaign culminates a few weeks before move-out when students are encouraged to bring the items they no longer need to nearby collection stations for donating.  During the 2013-14 school year, 12,685 lbs of waste were diverted thanks to this campaign!  ",--

The campaign involved outreach to students to recycle this waste and move-out recycling crews that collected the excess after students left. In 2013 the first year of the campaign, 25,010 lbs of reusable materials was diverted. 
The composting campaign was to compost all organic matter in the dining center. A student campaign was launched in March 2014 to educate all students about how to properly separate trash and compost. March 2014 diversion rate was 13,500 lbs.",--

Campus Conservation produced many measurable positive results.  The building as a whole decreased consumption of electricity vs the two week baseline.  Some suites in the building reduced their electricity use by as much as 25%, and all but one floor reduced their consumption.

Each sub-metered residence's energy consumption is monitored for one week prior to the start of the competition to create a baseline, followed by a one or two week competition to reduce the most energy. The residence that reduces their total percentage of energy consumption the most (per capita) over the competition period is awarded a prize. Students are provided with energy conserving information and engaged in energy saving practices throughout the span of the competition to educate them about the local, regional and global benefits of energy conservation.

Workshops include an in-depth understanding of diversity and equity issues, the different isms (ex. racism, ableism, sexism), how they intersect with each other and play out in a university context. Equity issues and unpacking common problematic statements that derail conversations about equity and social justice.And how to facilitate difficult conversations and disruptions in the moment when they occur and look at possible ways of handling these situations and/or turning them into teachable moments.","The positive impact of these programs is measured by the student and employee feedback upon competition of training as well as the change in the work environment that results from a better educated staff.
