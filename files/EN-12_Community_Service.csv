ethical projects of social change and political engagement (both locally and globally) and faculty whose teaching and scholarship encompass both disciplinary rigor and applied benefits for our communities are primary goals of our school. We accomplish these
aims in large part through our extensive service-learning courses and our “social responsibility” core learning objective and graduation requirement. Pitzer far surpasses the rest of the country in its community service efforts: the National Survey of Student
Engagement has found that nationally an average of 60% of a college or university participates in community service (volunteer, work study or course-related) while at Pitzer that number is 93%. Pitzer invests significant financial and human capital into
supporting service, primarily through its Community Engagement Center (which is funded through hard money and has a staff of 6). This Center has overseen and supported engaged scholarship at Pitzer College since 1998 by offering research awards and fellowships to faculty, staff, and students and connecting them with local community-based organizations that address a variety of social and cultural issues. Almost all students who do community service through service-learning courses (and many who volunteer to do so without a correlating course) are connected through CEC to gain entry to and placement at a community site, support for transportation there and an orientation on ethical standards and legal obligations."

Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service maintains an outreach web portal that provides information about outreach and community opportunities available to Tufts staff and faculty (as well as students and community partners). ,http://activecitizen.tufts.edu/?pid=4&c=87,"Within the university, there are many departments that offer courses that incorporate community experience or service learning with active citizenship. In the Schools of Arts, Sciences & Engineering, this includes American studies, anthropology, biology, community health, chemistry, child development, civil and environmental engineering, drama and dance, English, education, geology, history, Judaic studies, peace and justice studies, sociology, urban and environmental planning, among others. Tisch College inventories these courses annually to help students connect and navigate their interests.  

Among the professional schools, internships with a community-engaged focus are an essential component to accelerate and apply learning. The School of Dental Medicine, for example, requires a five-week externship in one of 25 facilities across the country including community health centers, military bases, and veterans’ facilities from its students.  Students are supervised to provide high-quality care to individuals whose access is limited.    

The School of Medicine integrates community engagement into its curriculum by requiring at least 50 hours of community service into its MD degree requirements.   Likewise, an Applied Learning Experience (ALE) is a requirement of the Masters in Public Health Program.  

Community engagement is a critical dimension of the Master of Science in Conservation Medicine Program of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.  Its commitment to the community is expressed in a One Health approach to address health issues facing animals and humans alike and the ecosystems they share. 

The Department of Food and Nutrition Policy of the School of Nutrition and its associated program tracks (Nutrition Communication; Food Policy and Applied Nutrition; Agriculture Food and Environment) require community-based internships as part of their degree requirements. 

The School of Dental Medicine demonstrates its commitment to engagement and service for vulnerable populations with a requirement of a clinical rotation in the community.  

Additionally, many graduate programs within Arts & Sciences integrate community engagement into their curricular frameworks.  Masters candidates within the Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning Program are required to complete field projects for community partners such as Aida Refugee Camp and Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative.

The UC Davis Community Service Resource Center is dedicated to provide service opportunities to campus faculty, staff, and students. There are numerous opportunities for the campus community, ranging from tutoring programs, habitat restoration and food drives. One of the many ways that  the CSRC does this is through the Weekend of Service (http://icc.ucdavis.edu/cs/volunteers/weos.htm), which is a is a quarterly event which provides members of the Davis community volunteer undertakings to aid non-profit organizations in need. A few of the community service initiatives are listed below.

Fall 2014: Putah Creek Council is dedicated to the protection and enhancement of Putah Creek and its tributaries through advocacy, education and community-based stewardship. Forty students and staff helped establish a field nursery. Volunteers installed nursery-grown plants at a site along the creek so they can grow larger in field conditions. They plan to transplant them as need arises for use at restoration sites. 

Fall 2014: Society for the Blind's mission includes providing life and job skills training, mentorship, and access to tools to maintain independence for thousands of youth, adults and seniors in Sacramento and the surrounding areas experiencing vision loss. Twelve students and staff cleaned the student training kitchen, break rooms and training room furniture . The kitchen has three separate bays that are used throughout the week by the Daily Living Skills Instructors and their students. This busy classroom is a vital space providing their students with the necessary skills and techniques to cook confidently and independently at home. Volunteers deep cleaned the appliances, cabinets, and work spaces and tidied  break rooms, training room chairs, and tables. 

Winter 2015: Community Harvest of Davis (formerly Village Harvest Davis) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, run entirely by volunteers, that harvests fruit from residential trees and donates it to agencies that feed people in need. Their mission is to provide food for people who need it, promote sustainable use of urban resources, and contribute to a stronger community. Twenty seven volunteers helped harvest 100 tangelo trees. They will donate the fruit (around 4,000 to 6,000 pounds) to Yolo Food Bank.

In addition, the CSRC recognizes the varied and generous dedication to community service by UC Davis students, staff, faculty, and student organizations, through its Annual UC Davis Community Service Awards (http://icc.ucdavis.edu/cs/CSA/). The recipients all receive certificates under different categories based upon dedicated service to others as well as breadth, quality, and time committed to community service. The categories are Outstanding, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. 

The Outstanding and Gold Recipients are invited to attend a reception with distinguished members from UC Davis administration. They may also be eligible for the President's Volunteer Service Award and the Chancellor's Civic Engagement Award.

UCSB's relationship with its community extends beyond the campus. Many faculty, staff, students, and graduates actively volunteer for local organizations. Their public service includes food drives, professional training, and health education. Members of the UCSB community also contribute to local social programs through Santa Barbara County United Way's Network for Caring.

UCSB’s United Way Campaign
Since 1923, the United Way of Santa Barbara County has been committed to making a difference in our community and working hard to ensure that contributions help local friends and neighbors in need. United Way of Santa Barbara County and its partners work to achieve community-driven 10-year goals, with a focus on the ""United 2020 Goals"": Education, Financial Stability, and Health. 
UC Santa Barbara employees raised over $111,000 for the local community, as part of the campus's 2013 United Way campaign. Taking advantage of the opportunity to contribute to their community, hundreds of UCSB's volunteers and donors gave money, made presentations that convinced others to join or make donations, and raised funds with candy grams and special events. UCSB's campaign is one of the largest in Santa Barbara County. http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/uw/partnering.aspxhttp 

K-12 Outreach
The campus sponsors an extensive program of classroom presentations, tours, demonstrations, field trips, musical and dance performances, and other educational outreach efforts for K-12 schools.
For example, the Kids In Nature is an innovative and highly regarded program designed to enrich the learning experiences of underrepresented and underserved youth in our community with a yearlong dynamic combination of hands-on, inquiry-based, classroom activities, interactive custom-designed computer simulations, and field trips.

Educating Future Leaders
The Educating Leaders for the Future (ELF) Program inspires youth to pursue sustainable academic and career pathways.  We do this through classroom presentations in local high schools and through after school programs.  Sustainability is being integrated into every sector of our economy and every major in higher education, and yet not enough programs are preparing our youth for this shift.   More youth will also be inspired to go to college when they learn how their studies can be relevant to their own lives. Sustainability is a great way to highlight this link. Our focus is on youth and families who have limited access to sustainability-based or environmental education. http://www.sustainability.ucsb.edu/elf/ 

College Preparation
UCSB offers an array of programs designed to enhance students' awareness and preparedness for higher education. For example, the Santa Barbara Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement Center (MESA) School Program addresses the historically low numbers of disadvantaged and low income students pursuing math- based majors in college. MESA provides academic/career awareness and preparation services for secondary students with high interests in math and science. The goal is for every participant to complete four years of college preparatory math and English, along with chemistry and physics, and to take the PSAT and SAT I&II before high school graduation. Functions involving students, their families, teachers, and staff include school site meetings and activities, field trips to college campuses, MESA day competitions, Academies, scholarships, and summer programs. Currently, more than 400 senior high school students and nearly 500 junior high school students are enrolled in the Santa Barbara and Ventura County Schools.http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/ps/college.aspx

UH faculty and staff awards increased their funded community-service oriented activities over the last five years. In 2014-2015 there were 217 funded research awards with “community emphasis.”

Three among the 600 outreach programs in the UH System stand out as signature programs that represent our progress are the Center for Mexican American Studies, Mobile Eye Institute, and the Leadership Academy. These represent how we sustained, expanded and added new programs in response to the 2008 recession. Each is led with the expertise of faculty and staff with the outstanding support of our student body.

The Academic Achievers Program (AAP) is sponsored by the Center for Mexican American Studies and the Office of the President. It was established in the fall of 1994 and is designed to retain and propel more students to graduation. The mission of the AAP at the University of Houston is to recruit underrepresented students. About 300 students from one high school alone participated in the program in 2012-2013. Ninety-five percent graduated from high school and 90% enrolled in college, most choosing to attend UH. AAP students are significantly more likely to graduate in six years compared with other Hispanic students who enroll at UH at the same time. This program has helped UH to obtain the Department of Education's designation as a Hispanic-Serving Institution in 2012 because 25% of undergraduate enrollment is Latino. Only three institutions in the country had the Tier One and Hispanic Serving Institution classification.

The Mobile Eye Institute (MEI) provides outreach and training opportunities for 500 students every year and 75 4th year optometry students. Service populations whose lack of mobility denies them access to eye care have been targeted since 2006. This program has expanded significantly after 2008. In 2012-2013 services were provided to over 50 schools, 10 juvenile detention facilities, FQHCs and other agencies including women and homeless shelters. Since 2008, MEI has provided 458 excursions by bringing quality eye care training opportunities out of the clinic walls and into streets. Over 8000 exams have generated over 5000 eye glass prescriptions.

The UH Leadership Academy is a new program for our NCAA Student-Athletes and the community, which started in 2008. The Leadership Academy ""develops, challenges, and supports student-athletes and coaches in their continual quest to become world-class leaders in athletics, academics, and life; the Academy functions to equip participants at every level with skillset necessary to be a confident, cooperative, critical decision maker and ethical contributor in a competitive and ever-changing world. ""This mission is executed in part by community outreach activities. Approximately 400 athletes now participate in outreach as coordinated through the Leadership Academy. Special Olympics, community beautification, visits to children's hospitals are now organized through the Leadership Academy. In 2012-2013 the Intercollegiate Athletics, American Red Cross, Houston Fire Department, and HOPE worldwide partnered to scale up fire prevention efforts for the CNCS MLK and September 11th Days of Service and Remembrance. To date, over 50,000 people have benefited from the door-to-door canvassing and fire prevention message to Houston's most vulnerable populations. At one event, the entire men's basketball team, including staff and coaches partnered with the stakeholders in the largest door-to-door fire prevention and smoke alarm distribution campaign in Houston.

In 2011, the Provost and college deans in collaboration with the executive board of the faculty union, developed a workload policy. “The primary goal is to ensure that all tenured faculty have an equitable total workload, which is defined as the sum of efforts in teaching, research and service.” Each college then developed policies determining expectations in these areas. For example, excerpted from the Workload Policy of the College of Health Sciences: “All members of the faculty . . . are expected to provide excellent service to University constituents: students, faculty, staff members, and community members…..Faculty members are encouraged to provide their professional expertise to professional societies, community agencies and other external organizations. Such service is recognized as an important asset to the university. Impact on workload will be assessed on an individual basis.” 

The College of Fine Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences is in the process of revisiting their current workload policies. There has been significant dialogue around further specifying what might be eligible for course reductions. The College is proposing to build into the system provisions that would encompass engagement activity. Currently, on a case by case basis, the dean grants course load reductions to allow faculty to work on specific types of service projects.

University faculty and staff have received awards for their engagement in the community. Chancellor Meehan accepted a major award from the Greater Lowell Community Foundation at its annual Philanthropy Day for UMass Lowell’s contributions to the community. Computer Science professor Holly Yanco in 2013 was recognized by Boston Business Journal as one of its “Women to Watch,” based in part on her science-education outreach in local schools as well as her key role in our new robotics research center that supports area companies. 

In 2012, our Executive Director of Community Relations received the locally prestigious Kelakos Award for Community Service, citing his work at UMass Lowell. Professor Georges Grinstein of the College of Sciences last year received the distinguished community partnership award of Community Teamwork Inc. of Greater Lowell. History professor Bob Forrant chaired a year-long commemoration of the centennial of the famous 1912 Bread & Roses Strike in Lawrence, Mass., with city tours, academic symposium, history exhibit, and more; also last year, English professor Diana Archibald organized “Dickens in Lowell,” an ambitious remembrance of author Charles Dickens’ 1842 visit to America with a stop in the model textile-mill city of Lowell, which included an award-winning museum exhibition in collaboration with the National Park Service and 65 community events, including a theatrical interpretation of the novel Oliver Twist by Lowell’s Nigerian Cultural Association.

The survey was designed through a collaborative effort of researchers and staff from the RGK Center, Office of Survey Research, Department of Sociology, and University Volunteer Center. The 1,514 respondents were chosen through a random selection of all UT undergraduates enrolled in the spring of 2002. Surveying was done via 20-minute telephone interviews administered by the Office of Survey Research. Upon evaluation, the demographic distribution of those surveyed closely matched the true demographics of the student body, including gender, ethnic background, grade level, and academic pursuits. 
 
Seventy-four percent (74%) of students performed volunteer service: 45% reported serving in the community; 25% served in both University and community functions; and 4% volunteered solely for University functions.
 
Volunteers spent a mean of 111 hours volunteering.
 
February 2014: While the Longhorn Center for Civic Engagement is still seeking funds (and staff resources) to conduct another survey, methods and opportunities to connect students with volunteering have only improved with more sophisticated technology. Austin is a larger city every year with thousands of opportunities to volunteer on and off campus. There is every reason to believe, and no evidence to the contrary, that the trends outlined in the RGK report have continued.

There has been no study conducted on graduate student volunteerism, so this report is on undergraduate students only.
