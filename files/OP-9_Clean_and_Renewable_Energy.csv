In the summer of 2008, SFU installed 54 solar photovoltaic panels on the south face of the Facilities Management Building to convert sunlight to electricity. It is a demonstration project and the purpose is to collect data to determine the efficiency of the solar photovoltaic array.

The panels can generate up to 10 kilowatts of power, and about 10,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. On average, a typical household in the Lower Mainland consumes 8,900 kilowatt hours of electricity.

The project allows SFU to offset 250 kg of greenhouse gas annually.

In the summer of 2008, SFU installed 2 sets of solar collectors on the roof of the Facilities Management Building.
The solar hot water system utilizes the energy from the sunlight to heat the water. It is designed to work with the domestic hot water heater in the building. In the system, a heating fluid (Glycol) is pumped into the solar collectors where it is heated. The heated fluid is then pumped into a heat exchanger where the heat is transferred to the water.

The solar hot water system not only provides domestic hot water to the building, but it also helps SFU reduce natural gas consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The system allows SFU to reduce about 40 GJ of natural gas and offset about 2,000 kg of greenhouse gas annually.",--,,--,,http://www.sfu.ca/fs/Green-Services/Case-Studies/Renewable-Energy.html,--

When biomass syngas is unavailable, UBC uses Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), an accredited carbon neutral biofuel, to fuel the engine to provide 2.0MW of electricity, 1.4MW of steam, and 1MW of hot water for UBC’s District Energy System. The engine is currently operating on RNG and is on track to provide 5 per cent of UBC’s annual electricity consumption and reduce UBC’s electrical demand by 2MWe.

Therefore, biomass is now displacing natural gas, whilst delivering the same amount of thermal energy for UBC’s campus heating requirements.

The farm has a student-run vegetable project and also trains students in artificial insemination of cattle. Faculty, extension staff, and graduate students conduct applied research and are assisted by talented technicians, field staff and undergraduate students. Since the spring of 2010, it has also been home to a 106-panel, 25 kilowatt PV project.
It has received support from the Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture, Center for Agriculture, UMass Facilities, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) and Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. The effort represents a public-private partnership with Berkshire Management Group and Diversified Construction Services, LLC. joining in to bring this demonstration project to its current stage..
These systems are placed either on non food-producing soils, marginal soils, dedicated centralized towers, or sloping roof structures that allow land use underneath or can also serve as storage facilities.
The research project has three goals.  First, it examines and documents the results of implementing ground-mounted solar energy technology on farm land, while simultaneously producing a crop. It also is designed to produce an electric power source to offset power usage at the research farm. Finally, the project will demonstrate how this type of PV can be implemented by a farm in a cost effective manner.
UMass Amherst raised funding for this effort from a combination of sources, including the Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture, UMass Extension Center for Agriculture, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) and DAR.

The landfill gas replaces commercial natural gas as the primary fuel in UNH’s COGEN plant.

UNH is the first university in the country to use landfill gas as its primary fuel source.

The Smart Modal Area Recharge Terminal, or SMART station, is a solar-powered electric car charging station and can accommodate 10 electric vehicles (EVs) and is located on Vanderbilt’s campus. The SMART station is a joint project of Vanderbilt, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Electric Power Research Institute to collect data on the operation of a charging station as well as the integration of the station into the operation of a “smart” power grid. This data will inform the further development of Tennessee’s electric vehicle infrastructure. The SMART station was opened in Fall 2012. The electricity produced by the SMART station goes directly back to the NES grid.

Four solar-powered charging stations were installed on campus in Spring 2012– a Solar Dok patio table and three walk-up Solstice units. Members of the Vanderbilt community can charge their electronics while outside, utilizing the batteries charged by solar power. The charging stations were a project of the Vanderbilt Green Fund, a collaborative venture of Plant Operations, the Office of the Dean of Students and Vanderbilt Student Government to fund utility conservation projects proposed by students and selected with student input. The power from these units goes directly into a battery used to power electronic devices.
