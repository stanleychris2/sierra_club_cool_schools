The survey was designed to help learn more about commuting behavior and patterns of the GW community.  Random samples of students and of employees (faculty and staff) were selected to participate.  Employees included in the sample were from Foggy Bottom Campus, Mount Vernon Campus, and Virginia Science Technology Campus. The survey closed after two weeks of distribution, near the end of February 2016. The survey was distributed electronically to 1,297 employees and 1,298 students. A total of 718 faculty and staff responded, while 309 students responded, which provided response rates of 55% and 24%, respectively. 

Primary transportation was considered the mode of transportation that was used to travel the greatest distance (mileage) to and from campus. For employees, telecommuting 50% or more was determined using a formula. If an employee had a benefit category of Full Time Regular Employee and commuted 2 days or less, then they were considered a teleworker who telecommuted for 50% or more of their regular work hours. If an employee had a benefit category of Part Time Regular Employee, Affordable Care Act, or Not Eligible for Benefits and commuted 1 day or less, then they were considered a teleworker who telecommuted for 50% or more of their regular work hours. 

The commuting data do not include student travel to/from campus at the beginning/end of each semester. STARS data are based on this 2016 survey. Numbers extrapolated were determined to the best of our understanding of the data being requested.  
",http://transportation.gwu.edu/transportation-services,"To facilitate transportation between GW's three campuses (Foggy Bottom, Mount Vernon, and Virginia), GW operates the Vern Express which runs between the Mount Vernon Campus and the Foggy Bottom Campus, the Virginia Shuttle which transports people between the Virginia Science and Technology Campus (VSTC) to the Foggy Bottom Campus, and offers a free shuttle (the Wiehle Express) to and from the Wiehle Metro station to GW's VSTC. These shuttle and bus services for students, faculty, and staff help reduce vehicle miles traveled per capita by reducing reliance on single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) as a primary mode of transit.

The main purpose of the survey is to collect annual data on how the UC Davis community travels to campus, including mode choice, vehicle occupancy, distances traveled, and carbon emissions. Over the past seven years, the travel survey results have been used to assess awareness and utilization of campus transportation services and estimate demand for new services designed to promote sustainable commuting at UC Davis. Data from the campus travel survey have also provided researchers with valuable insights about the effects of attitudes and perceptions of mobility options on commute mode choice. This year’s survey is the eighth administration of the campus travel survey.

The 2014-15 survey was administered online in October 2014, distributed by email to a stratified random sample of 30,815 students, faculty, and staff (out of an estimated total population of 42,405). About 14 percent (4,224 individuals) of those contacted responded to this year’s survey, with 11.4 percent actually completing it. For the statistics presented throughout this report, we weight the responses by role (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, Master’s student, PhD student, faculty, and staff) and gender so that the proportion of respondents in each group reflects their proportion in the campus population.",http://goclub.ucdavis.edu/,"Thigpen, Calvin (2015) Results of the 2014-15 Campus Travel Survey.

UC San Diego can best ensure accuracy by reporting metrics currently tracked by Transportation Services, which meticulously documents the total number of commuters during its annual survey of pedestrian and vehicle traffic.
This survey focuses on tracking all commuter data for transportation and greenhouse gas purposes, but it does not distinguish between student, faculty, staff or campus visitors. Over a decade of data has been collected in this manner and demonstrates a significant increase in alternative transportation usage by commuters.  The percentages provided are the most precise representation of UC San Diego commuters currently available.

The MMTC results indicate the primary mode of travel to and from campus, and do not include multi-modal trips or people who use different modes throughout the week (such as someone who usually drives, but takes the bus sometimes). 

Our total population of employees and students at the main campus is 40,894. 2,679 people* (7%) responded to the MMTC survey. This sample size provides us a 95% confidence level** and a 2% margin of error***. The confidence level and margin of error were calculated using SurveyMonkey's Sample Size Calculator: https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/

The University receives total transit trip data from Port Authority of Allegheny County, but at this time cannot distinguish between student and employee travel. We hope that future technology advancements will allow us to distinguish between employee and student ridership counts. 

According to MMTC, the mode split for the University of Pittsburgh main campus (for employees and students combined) is as follows:
Drive Alone: 38.6%
Carpool: 4.8%
Vanpool: 0.9%
Dropped off: 2.6%
Bus: 34.3%
Light Rail: 2.3%
Park and Ride: 3.0%
University Shuttle: 0.7%
Bike: 5.1%
Walk: 7.2%
Telecommute: 0.2%
Other: 0.3%

For the purposes of this reporting, the following adjustments were made to the MMTC category results:
- It is assumed that all students residing in campus housing on or near campus either walk or bicycle as their primary means of transportation.
- Resident students with a parking permit are not included in the ""commute with only the driver in the vehicle"" category estimates. This is because resident students are already on campus and would not need to use their vehicle to commute to campus.
- Due to changing class schedules, it is assumed that students typically do not carpool or vanpool for their commute to campus. However, it is reasonable to assume that some students may be dropped off or picked up from campus by a parent that lives or works near the Oakland area. About 3% of the people from Pitt that responded to the MMTC survey did indicate that they are dropped off. Thus, we assumed that 3% of students commuting to campus are dropped off by someone else. We included that 3% estimate in the ""vanpool or carpool"" category. 
- The MMTC results indicate that about 41% of the total Pitt population (students and employees) take the bus, light rail, university shuttle, or use park and rides. It was assumed that at least this percentage of students use some type of transit service as their primary mode of transportation to and from campus.
- 16% of the student population could not be accounted for using the above methods. This remaining percentage was applied equally to the ""commute with only the driver in the vehicle"" and ""take a campus shuttle or public transportation"" categories (8% each). This is assumed to account for students who drive alone but don't have permits and pay per day or at meters. It also assumes a higher percentage of students using public transit and campus shuttles than faculty or staff members.

The regional MMTC survey results can be found at: http://www.makemytripcount.org/
Main campus population numbers are reported as recorded in the University's 2016 Fact Book: http://www.ir.pitt.edu/factbook/documents/FactBook2016.pdf 

   * MMTC results can not distinguish between student and employee responses.
  ** Confidence Level: The probability that our survey sample accurately reflects the behaviors of the entire population.
 *** Margin of Error: The range, measured as a percentage, that the total population's behaviors might deviate from our sample responses.

-Total number of riders of our bus system in October 2015.
-Daily, weekly, and monthly ridership numbers are provided by busing contractor.
