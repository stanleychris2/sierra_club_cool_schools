Appalachian State University,2016-02-01,2016-02-01 13:37:13,balllf@appstate.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,,"Combined Pricing Initiative (CPI)
 
On May 5, 2010 UNC General Administration announced to the UNC System's Chancellors and CIOs the launch of the Combined Pricing Initiative (CPI) [PDF] (275 KB) CPI's goals are to leverage the buying power of the entire UNC System and to meet cost-saving standards set by the North Carolina General Assembly. CPI standards currently apply to all PC desktop and laptop computers obtained with state appropriated funds. As of July 1, 2010 participation in CPI is mandatory for all UNC System schools.
 
PC computers must be obtained only from CPI ""Preferred Vendors"", currently Dell, Lenovo, and HP. Over the past few years Appalachian State University has standardized on Dell for PC desktops and laptops, so this is not a change for our campus. We will continue to obtain Apple computers as an individual campus as Apple is not currently part of the CPI program. PC purchases should be obtained through our campus purchasing portal - Yo-Mart.
 
A task force organized by UNC-GA has established a range of standard desktop and laptop computer configurations meant to reflect the diverse administrative and academic needs of UNC System campuses. This task force has negotiated best prices with CPI Preferred Vendors and Appalachian State information technology professionals have established campus standards in alignment with UNC-GA's CPI standards. This means that the default desktop and laptop packages conform to CPI standards.
 
Only CPI standards-compliant computer configurations are allowed, except where non-standard configurations are required for specialized research, teaching, or administrative needs. The total dollar amount of ""non-standard"" computers may not exceed 20% of the total of state funds used for PC purchases. In those cases where a non-standard configuration is required a formal request for an exception must be made. Reports must be submitted to UNC-GA detailing approved exceptions.
 
We estimate that for all computer purchases during FY 2009-2010 less than 5% would have been considered an ""exception"", thus this is a minimal change to our past paradigm. Our current process for requesting exceptions will be formalized and modified slightly to reflect the changing needs for reporting and documentation. Details on this refined process will be posted to this website as they become available.
 
Environmental Statement: Appalachian State University's standards for computer purchasing meet EPEAT standards. All recommended computers are EPEAT Gold Certified. EPEAT®-registered products meet strict environmental criteria. From fewer toxins in manufacturing to efficient operation and easier recycling, EPEAT-registered products offer a reduced environmental impact across their lifecycles.
",All computer purchasing at Appalachian is conducted through our campus purchasing portal - Yo-Mart.  Technology Support Services sets the purchasing standards for computers on campus and abides by the State of North Carolina's Combined Purchasing Initiative.

The following initiatives represent our ongoing efforts, and we continually analyze our processes to find areas where we can become more sustainable as we provide and support technology resources for faculty, staff and students.
Equipment

Seminar Room Computers:
We recently realized reduced our energy use by 61% in one of our seminar rooms by upgrading the workstation configuration used by ITS and the University for technology training. The original workstation configuration required 3 power supplies and 2 network lines. The new configuration only requires a single network connection and reduced the number of power supplies to one. Click here to view a detailed summary of these energy savings (PDF).
Servers:
Moving existing servers to virtualized servers where possible is reducing the number of physical servers supported by ITS. The advantages include not only power reduction, but also less hardware to be recycled, and more physical space recovered in the existing server room.
Loaner Program:
By providing computers for the employee checkout program, departments can take advantage of a centralized resource so that departments will not have to purchase extra equipment for travel purposes.
Hardware Installation & Repair Shop
The Hardware Installations and Repair Shop work side-by-side to separate, sort, and recycle all electronic equipment. Packaging materials are disposed of in the following manner:

Unused Packaged CDs are sent to Goodwill Computer Works
VGA/DVI cables are sent to M. Lipsitz & Co., Ltd.
Cardboard Boxes are reused for shipping
Various Cardboard Materials are placed in campus recycling containers
Plastic Bags & Paper are placed in campus recycling containers
Composite Plastic Packaging & Styrofoam are reused as packing material
The equipment returned by the Client Services Installations group is sorted according to age and working condition. If the systems are in good shape and in working condition, they go through a bidding process and are sold to local and national vendors. These proceeds go back into Baylor's general revenue fund. Equipment that is not in working condition or has not been used for spare parts is recycled as follows:
Goodwill Computer Works	M. Lipsitz & Co., Ltd.
Monitors (LCD, CRT)
Computers (Desktop, Laptops)
Printers (Laser, Inkjet)
Scanners 
Keyboards
Mice
Speakers
Ink & Toner Cartridges
Telephones
Printer parts (drums, rollers, trays, duplexers)
Mother boards 
Televisions
VCR and projectors
Server boxes and racks
Hard Drives (degaussed and crushed)
Power cables and wires
Power supplies
DVI/VGA cables
DVI/VGA splitters
Power adapters
Aluminum frames and cans
ITS is currently recycling all printers through the HP Trade-In Program. During the packing procedure, the installations department reuses the same boxes and packing material (Styrofoam) in which the new printer is shipped.

Technology Procurement

The following list represents the vendors used by the University for purchasing computers and printers. All of these vendors have established green initiatives that we take advantage of by purchasing their products:

Apple
Dell
Hewlett-Packard
Electronic Library
Printing:
By centralizing print management, excessive printing and print waste is reduced. Duplex printing by default is set for all public printers on campus. All printers located in the libraries use remanufactured toner and recycled paper.
Displays:
Window OS systems used in general access and departmental facilities are set to sleep mode when not in use for an hour or less. iMac displays are set to sleep mode after three minutes of inactivity.
Computer Systems:
CPUs in non-24-hour facilities are powered off over the weekend, Friday night through Saturday morning. All computers in the Moody Study Commons are turned off when facility is closed.

Please contact IT Support to initiate the ordering process. The IT staff will work with you to identify the option(s) to meet your needs.

There are a number of advantages this policy offers:

    Cost savings: cost savings are realized through discounts, greater standardization, volume purchasing, staffing efficiencies, and other means;
    Consulting services: IT is available to consult on the best options;
    Support: affords more effective and efficient maintenance and support;
    Tracking: appropriate equipment and software licenses will be added to the College's inventory database maintained by IT for insurance and accounting purposes;
    Compatibility: insures compatibility between all components of the Beloit College network;
    Big picture: provides IT with knowledge of campus resources to facilitate collaboration with, and integration of, information technology.

Please note that IT will only purchase from approved vendors who provide supported products. College technology purchases are not made from individuals, through online auctions such as eBay or any similar type of purchasing source.

App purchases from places such as the Mac App Store or the Android Market are related to a personal account. Therefore, individuals may make these purchases without consulting with IT. It is up to the budget manager to determine if college funds should be used to make these purchases. If you have questions about what App may be beneficial to meet a particular need please feel free to consult with IT.

Please allow additional time when requesting to purchase technology using college restricted funds or grant monies. IT will forward all these requests to Accounting for approval prior to placing the order.

From the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Policy:
The University will work towards increasing the procurement of electronics with certain environmental attributes (i.e. reduced or no toxic constituents, recycled-content, designed for recycling, reduced materials use, energy efficient, extended product life/upgradeable, remanufactured, etc.). The Purchasing Manual will be updated from time to time to provide references to current, meaningful standards and guidelines for certain product categories (for example, ENERGY STAR rating, Electronic Products Environmental Assessment Tool [EPEAT] score).

Suppliers will be required to deliver the items to the University with energy efficiency and conservation features enabled (i.e. sleep mode, duplex printing, etc.).

Refurbishing services may be used in place of new purchases of computer upgrades or electronic equipment.","CSU does not enforce EPEAT printers but does make their purchase a priority. We also have a campus wide program, called Planet Partners, to replace old printers with ENERGY STAR printers (these are not EPEAT printers but do focus on reducing energy consumption). http://wsnet.colostate.edu/cwis191/procurement/PPP.aspx

1. Appliances should meet EPA Energy Star requirements for eligible products. 
2.

In the case of CTS equipment in particular, the complexities of the technology marketplace and manufacturing environment have led to many unsustainable practices both environmentally and socially. GMC will continue to identify and work with technology companies whose current & future policies are in line with the sustainability mission of the College. 
To further reduce impact and the need to purchase new equipment, CTS endeavors to maximize the lifespan of its equipment. This may be accomplished in two ways. First, CTS strives to purchase equipment with an expected lifespan of over five years, and aims to keep that equipment in service for at least that length of time. Second, for computers at the end of their useful life, usable parts will be taken out, refurbished, repaired, and reused if possible, while unusable parts will be processed as e-waste. This e-waste will go to a certified e-waste collector in New England, so that the material can be recycled. 

","The CTS staff, including the director, were involved in creating the policy, so they are fully on board with striving to consistently meet the directives. The facilities director was also involved in vetting the purchasing policy. The director of sustainability reaches out directly to other departments when a major renovation or purchase is taking place to ensure that they are aware of the purchasing policy. He also presents the information periodically to the staff assembly.

The directive is listed separately on each vendor contract. The verbiage from the IU Dell Enterprise agreement is listed here:

Environmental Impact Statement:
a.   Recognizing our impact as a major purchaser of goods and services, Indiana University gives preference to environmentally friendly vendors of Information Technology products that can conserve energy, reduce costs, improve public and worker health, conserve natural resources, and be properly disposed of, while allowing the university to remain fiscally responsible.

b.    Dell strives to meet or exceed industry standards in energy efficiency, with the latest achievements supporting benchmarks such as Energy Star 4.0 and EPEAT Gold. Dell’s unique customization allows customers to select the power-efficient components they want, and Dell continues to aim for even greater energy efficiency options in up-and-coming technology.  When purchasing computer monitors, desktop computers, or notebook computers Indiana University will require the disclosure of the following:
      i. EPEAT Registration: As a leader in providing environmentally responsible products and services, Dell was one of the first manufacturers to register products with EPEAT.   As of the Effective Date of this Agreement, Dell has dozens of products in EPEAT, including EPEAT-Silver products. These include certain models of our OptiPlex desktops, Precision workstations (both desktop and mobile versions), Latitude notebooks and flat panel monitors. 
      ii.                Energy Star Certification:  For a complete list of Dell’s ENERGY STAR 4.0 products, visit www.dell.com/energysmart.  IU can find a full list of Dell’s ENERGY STAR products at www.energystar.gov  The vendor shall provide customer support (which may be in the form of manuals) with respect to power management features, such that these features remain properly enabled and repaired if a malfunction occurs.

c.     Other Environmental Considerations:  , Indiana University strongly supports any initiative on behalf on its contractor(s) to implement toxic reduction/phase out; materials efficiency; energy efficiency; extended product life and sustainable end-of-life management; and environmentally sound manufacturing and request that such information be included in bid documentation.

d.    Exemption – Nothing contained in this statement regarding environmentally preferable purchasing may be construed as requiring the acquisition of goods or services that do not perform adequately for their intended use, exclude adequate competition, or are not available at a reasonable price in a reasonable period of time.

Green Computer Purchasing Policy
March 2012
 
 
Mount Holyoke College is committed to using greener equipment and implementing practices that are environmentally friendly and promote sustainability.  Our green computer purchasing policy is a reflection of that commitment. 
 
Benefits of Green Computers
 
Green computers save electricity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prevent water pollution emissions, reduce use of toxic materials and reduce the need for disposal of hazardous waste.
 
Certifications
 
Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) is an easy-to-use, on-line tool helping institutional purchasers select and compare computer desktops, laptops and monitors based on their environmental attributes.  EPEAT was developed using a grant by EPA and is managed by the Green Electronics Council (GEC). It is dedicated to informing purchasers of the environmental criteria of electronic products.
 
EPEAT-registered computer products have reduced levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury to better protect human health, and are easier to upgrade and recycle, in addition to meeting the government's Energy Star guidelines for energy efficiency. By buying EPEAT registered products, purchasers are significantly contributing to reducing the environmental impacts of their computers.
EPEAT products are measured against both required and optional criteria. A product must meet all of the required criteria in its category to be added to the registry. It is then rated Bronze (meets all required criteria), Silver (meets all required criteria, plus 50% of optional criteria) or Gold (meets all required criteria, plus 75% of optional criteria), depending on how many of the optional criteria it meets.
 
Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping to protect the environment and save money through energy efficient products and practices.

Products and Purchasing
 
All standard computer desktop and laptop configurations at Mount Holyoke College are EPEAT Gold or Silver products.  In addition, all computers purchased by Mount Holyoke College meet Energy Star requirements to reduce their impact on the environment. 

The College preference is that all future computer purchases are Energy Star-certified and meet the standard of EPEAT Silver or higher. ","The policy is an operational policy of Library, Information and Technology Services.  Exceptions from the policy require approval by an officer.

The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) is a global rating system that serves to identify environmentally preferable devices in order to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of electronics. EPEAT serves to connect purchasers to environmentally preferable choices, demonstrating environmental responsibility and innovation. The goal for Stevens will be able to look for electronics that use less energy, are made with recyclable and recycled materials, and which are easier to upgrade, fix, and recycle. 

Stevens, as an institution, will demonstrate a purchasing preference for computers and other electronics certified and registered with the EPEAT sustainability standard tool. This is an institution-wide purchasing policy preference and directive that applies to any future products that can be registered with EPEAT. This includes, but is not limited to: desktop computers, notebook/laptop computers, displays, televisions, thin clients, and imaging equipment. This does not include products for which there are no EPEAT certified products, such as mobile devices, tablets, smartphones, or specialized equipment.

Stevens will delegate a member of its electronics purchasing organization as a point of contact who can respond to questions regarding the number of EPEAT products and their ratings.  This data shall be submitted on an annual basis by calendar and fiscal year.  This data, once submitted, will then become publically available through sustainability reporting tools such as the Sustainability Tracking Assessment & Rating System. This responsible party will confirm that the submitted information is accurate to the best of their knowledge. 

This policy contains two parts, the institutional preference and the purchasing of EPEAT registered electronics.  Stevens commits to the future purchasing of exclusively EPEAT Gold computers, televisions and imaging equipment, as compared to Silver and Bronze certified computers.  With both sections of this policy in place, it will be beneficial to the university as it shows the commitment Stevens has to the environment.  

Additionally, Stevens will show an institutional preference to purchasing electronics with the following characteristics; ENERGY STAR label, electronics with recycled content, lead-free products, and electronics with extended product life.

Covered Products:
For the purposes of this category, computers include both stationary and portable units, including desktop computers, notebook (which includes laptops) computers, and tablet PCs. Although computers must be capable of using input devices and displays, computer systems do not need to include these devices on shipment to meet this definition.

Definitions:
Computer: means a computer central processing unit (CPU) and, where attached to a CPU, such computer cases, computer memory, cards and other peripheral devices as may reasonably be viewed functionally as one unit. (As defined in State Finance Law Article XI, Section 168, General definitions 1a.)
Desktop Computer: A computer where the main unit is intended to be located in a fixed location, often on a desk or on the floor. Desktops are not designed for portability and utilize an external monitor (although some more modern systems offer integrated systems which incorporated the CPU, monitor and devices in a single unit), keyboard, and mouse. Desktops are designed for a broad range of office applications including, email, web browsing, word processing, standard graphics applications, etc.
Flame Retardants (FRs): are chemicals added to products containing plastics and/or other synthetic materials to inhibit ignition and the spread of flames.
Notebook and Tablet Computers: A computer designed specifically for portability and to be operated for extended periods of time without a direct connection to an AC power source. Notebooks and tablets must utilize an integrated monitor and be capable of operation off an integrated battery or other portable power source. In addition, most notebooks and tablets use an external power supply and have an integrated keyboard and pointing device, though tablets use touch-sensitive screens. Notebook and tablet computers are typically designed to provide similar functionality to desktops except within a portable device.

Standard Setting and Certification Programs:
Various national and international standards apply to computer products. They are defined here as a guide.

Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive – A European Parliament and Council Directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. It bans the placing for sale on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more then agreed levels of lead, cadium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants.

For additional information on RoHS please visit http://www.rohs.gov.uk/
ENERGY STAR® - is a voluntary energy efficiency program sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The ENERGY STAR® program makes identification of energy efficient computers easy by labeling products that deliver the same or better performance as comparable models while using less energy and saving money. ENERGY STAR® qualified computers and monitors automatically power down to 15 watts or less when not in use and may actually last longer than conventional products because they spend a large portion of time in a low-power sleep mode. For additional information on the ENERGY STAR® program, including product specifications and a list of qualifying products, visit the ENERGY STAR® website at http://www.energystar.gov.
Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) – EPEAT is a system to help purchasers in the public and private sectors evaluate, compare and select desktop computers, notebooks and monitors based on their environmental attributes through a set of performance criteria for the design of products. The EPEAT
EO4 Specification Desktop and Laptop Computers October 2008 1
website registry includes products that have been declared by their manufacturers to be in conformance with the environmental performance standard for electronic products - IEEE 1680- 2006. Three of the 23 EPEAT required criteria are that the registered computers must be ENERGY STAR®, are in compliance with provisions of European RoHS Directive, and PC manufacturers have provisions of product take-back service. For additional information on EPEAT please visit the EPEAT site at http://www.epeat.net/

Specifications:
Environmental Performance:
All Desktop, Notebook, and Tablet PCs shall be registered Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Silver or better in the EPEAT registration system and meet or exceed all of the following 6 optional EPEAT criteria for standard configuration and standard option form factors:
• 4.1.2.1 Elimination of intentionally added cadmium
• 4.1.5.1 Elimination of intentionally added hexavalent chromium
• 4.1.6.2 Large plastic parts free of certain flame retardants classified under European Council Directive 67/548/EEC
• 4.1.7.1 Batteries free of lead, cadmium and mercury (not applicable for Monitors)
• 4.1.8.1 Large plastic parts free of PVC
• 4.8.2.2 Packaging 90% recyclable and plastics labeled
This standard includes the requirements of RoHS, ENERGY STAR®, and Energy Law, Article 5, Section 5-108a.
Note: All Desktop and Notebook PCs purchased through OGS’ Aggregate PC Purchase Initiative are registered EPEAT Silver or better in the EPEAT registration system, and meet the above listed criteria. The Desktop PC-Business Class category is registered as EPEAT Silver and meets or exceeds numerous optional EPEAT criteria for standard configurations and standard option form factors. This enables NY State and Local Government to maximize Environmental Preferred Purchasing considerations by acquiring PCs that meet or exceed industry standards for energy efficiency and environmental concerns.

Affected entities not using the Aggregate PC Purchase Initiative are encouraged to purchase PCs which meet the EPEAT Gold standard and the 6 optional criteria listed above plus:
• 4.8.3.2 Minimum postconsumer content guidelines

Bulk Delivery and Alternate Packaging:
New York State encourages the use of innovative packaging that reduces the weight of packaging and the generation of packaging waste. Bidders/contractors are encouraged to use reusable materials and containers and to utilize packaging configurations that take advantage of storage containers designed to be part of the product for the shipment of multi-unit purchases. New York State recognizes that these packaging methods are in the development stage and may not be currently available. Companies are urged to consider more of these options, and state contractors are urged to offer these services as part of their contract price list. Authorized users are urged to inquire about these programs when purchasing computers and determine the best solution for their needs.

Take-Back / Recycling*:
When replacing equipment, affected entities should work with the contractor during the purchasing process to evaluate available trade-in options, regardless of manufacturer. Contractors are required to offer programs that include take-back or trade-in, and proper environmental disposal of equipment (including equipment manufactured and sold by others).

State agencies are reminded to follow the NY State Finance Law § 167 regarding surplus property redistribution before utilizing take-back, recycling, or other options for disposition of any units that are still in operable condition. This standard requires donation of usable equipment to education (or other state agencies) prior to declaration of equipment as surplus or waste.

EO4 Specification Desktop and Laptop Computers October 2008 2
Affected entities are reminded to receive certification of data destruction from hard drives if surrendered with the machines; or, if for security purposes you are required to keep the hard drive, to negotiate this with the contractor as there may be additional fees or trade-in value reductions associated with retaining the hard drive.
If units are being transferred for disposition, a record of each disposition shall be retained by the affected entity. Documentation shall be provided to the affected entity demonstrating that these products have been disposed of in environmentally sound manner in compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws. The contractor or disposing entity shall provide assurance to the affected entity that all exports of used electronics collected for reuse, recycling or disposal will be in compliance with the laws of the importing country.
*Note: One of the criteria for EPEAT certification is:

NYECL §37-0111 recognizes that brominated flame retardants constitute substances hazardous to the environment, and prohibits any person to manufacture, process or distribute in commerce a product, or a flame-retardant part of a product, containing more than one-tenth of one per centum of pentabrominated diphenyl ether (pentaPBDE) or octabrominated diphenyl ether (octaPBDE), by mass. Brominated flame retardants are a class of halogenated flame retardants. Because New York State Executive Order No. 4 mandates ongoing development of lists and specifications for the procurement of commodities, services and technology that reasonably will reduce or eliminate the health and environmental risks from the use or release of toxic substances, bidders responding to solicitations are encouraged to disclose all flame retardants used in the products offered, including but not limited to penta, octa or decaPBDE and submit with their response a description of their efforts, if any, to utilize non-halogenated or other flame retardant compounds and/or design strategies that reduce the need to utilize flame retardant compounds. In addition, bidders are encouraged to offer products that meet flame retardancy standards or flammability requirements without added flame retardants with particular attention to halogenated flame retardants. Voluntary responses received will be forwarded to the Executive Order No. 4 Interagency Committee on Sustainability and Green Procurement for informational purposes to enable its periodic review and supplementation of green procurement lists and specifications for use by New York State Agencies and Authorities.

• Purpose
• The purpose of this policy is to support campus sustainability at the
University of Florida and to provide guidelines, information, and
resources in procuring products that will minimize negative impacts on
society and the environment to the greatest extent practicable.
• Responsibilities of Departments
• Develop and maintain information about environmentally and socially
preferable products. Departments should use the list composed in this
document as a guideline and may add or modify the list as needed.
• Inform employees of their responsibilities under this policy; provide
them with information about sustainable procurement opportunities.
Check the Purchasing web page for frequent updates on vendor
commitments to sustainability, including new annual contracts and
participation in vendor shows.
• Submit new ideas, problems or concerns to Purchasing (352) 392-1331
or e-mail purchasing@ufl.edu.
• Best Practices and Procurement Strategies
• Reduce waste at the point of purchase.
Faculty, staff and students can help achieve the university's waste
reduction goals by practicing the three R's: reducing, reusing, and
recycling. Priority should be given to reducing waste upstream by
purchasing products made from recycled material that can be reused or
recycled.  • Office paper, letterhead stationery, envelopes, and business cards
made from recycled paper
 • Office supplies
 • Recycled, remanufactured, or re-filled toner cartridges
 • Furniture made with a percentage of postconsumer or postindustrial
material and/or FSC 50% certified wood
To reduce disposal costs and waste, choose items that can be
remanufactured, recycled, or composted. Many products made from
recycled materials are available and are being included in the University
of Florida contracts.
Contract information is available from the Purchasing website under
contracts and UF Pricing.
• Purchase durable and reusable goods.
Using life-cycle cost analysis, rather than automatically choosing goods
with the lowest purchase price, can help departments identify the best
long-term value. Factor in a product's estimated life span as well as its
energy, maintenance, consumable supplies and disposal costs.
 • Consider durability and reparability of products prior to purchase.
 • Invest in goods with extended warranties. Conduct routine
maintenance on products/equipment.
 • Save money and minimize waste by eliminating single-use items,
such as non rechargeable batteries, in favor of rechargeable batteries.
Use rechargeable cartridges.
• Lease and rent when appropriate.
Consider an operating lease or rental rather than a purchase or capital
lease. Lease and rental contracts give vendors the responsibility for the
upkeep of goods such as computers and copiers, and for managing
them at the end of their useful life. Businesses that lease equipment
tend to manufacture more durable items, salvage reusable parts,
refurbish, recycle, or donate used equipment that can no longer be
leased. Renting is a cost-effective option for short-term equipment
needs.
• Specify product and packaging take-back.
 • Increasingly, product vendors are offering to take back the products
they sell when they become obsolete. By utilizing vendors who offer an
Extended Product Responsibility (EPR) program, especially take-back,
recycle, and disposal programs, departments are ensured equipment
and products are disposed of properly whether recycled, donated,
refurbished or disposed of without the added cost.
 • Other vendors will take back used items, such as carpeting and
toner cartridges, when purchasers buy new products. For example, several carpet manufacturers have invested in sophisticated recycling
facilities that turn old carpet into new carpet or other goods and toner
cartridges are disposed of properly or sent to be recharged and sold at
a lower cost.
 • Departments should require vendors to assume responsibility for
some of their shipping materials, such as wooden pallets and excess
packaging materials. When ordering large furniture or computer
shipments request products ship blanket-wrapped or using reduced
packing material.
• Buy goods in bulk or concentrated form.
This practice can significantly reduce the packaging associated with
lower product quantities and save costs. Carefully estimate demand
when purchasing in bulk; purchasing more than is needed can create
excess that becomes waste.
• Manage surplus effectively.
The University of Florida can reduce waste by eliminating excess
purchases. Reviewing past needs can minimize the procurement of
unneeded items. Clean out your office supply cabinet and post reusable
items for UF Departments on GatorList.net or donate to local
non-profit organizations such as Alachua County's Tools for Schools.
Departments should utilize Asset Management Services for disposing of
unwanted, out-dated property. Asset Management will effectively
redistribute, recycle, or dispose of surplus property by bidding it out
over the Internet through surplus on-line bids, police auctions, property
warehouse, or federal warehouse. For more information see Asset
Management Services Web Site: http://fa.ufl.edu/am/surplus/.
• Procure commodities that are certified to meet sustainability
standards.

 • Chlorine Free Products Association - www.chlorinefreeproducts.org
Electronics and Appliances:
 • Energy Star - www.energystar.gov/purchasing

EPEAT has tiers of environmental performance. UF's bundled
computers will meet at least the EPEAT silver standard. UF's preference
is that when the certification is available on the products being
purchased, all purchases of computers and monitors meet or exceed
the silver EPEAT certification. Cross-sector: (examples: cleaning supplies)

Food:
 • USDA Organic, Food Alliance Certified, Ranforest Alliance Certified,

• Procure remanufactured goods and use refurbishing services.
It is generally much less expensive to buy remanufactured goods such
as remanufactured toner cartridges, or to use refurbishing services for
computer upgrades, carpet repair, and furniture reupholster, than to
buy new items. ""Recharged"" toner cartridges typically save
departments 30 to 50 percent per sheet of paper. Remanufactured
items should require no sacrifice in performance. Check with
Purchasing for current contracts in place for remanufactured products.
• Purchase goods containing fewer toxic constituents.
By procuring goods with fewer or no toxic chemicals, departments can
reduce their hazardous waste disposal, future liability concerns, and the
risk of occupational exposure and spills. Low-toxicity products such as
mercury-free medical supplies, low mercury light bulbs/lamps with a
content of 90 picograms per lumen-hour or less, printing ink low in
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and chrome and chlorine free
cleaning supplies are increasingly available and cost-competitive. See
the Cross-sector certifications to help selecting products. The University
prefers all cleaning products purchased are either Green Seal or
EcoLogo certified.
• Reduce paper use.
 • Set all printers, copiers, and fax machines to the default duplex
mode if the function is available.
 • Purchase office equipment that has duplex capability.  • Purchase paper with recycled content
 • Utilize technology to send and store information electronically.
 • Utilize internet fax when available.
 • E-mail document files instead of faxing hardcopies.
 • Instead of having forms preprinted and stored, fill out forms online
and print as needed when available and feasible.
 • Store documents electronically instead of storing hard copies.
• Current Guidelines in Place
• All University of Florida personnel will purchase recycled and
environmentally preferable products whenever practicable.
• University of Florida Departments will purchase hybrid or alternative
fuel vehicles.
• The University of Florida will have a recycle container available within a
reasonable distance of soda machines and in all dining establishments
where canned or bottled drinks are served:
http://www.ppd.ufl.edu/grndrr.htm. Contact Physical Plant's Solid
Waste Coordinator at 392-7396 or 392-1148 x 301.
• University of Florida should promote the use of recycled and other
environmentally preferable products by publicizing its sustainable
procurement program. Materials produced for advertising,
conferences, trade fairs, press releases, and other communications with
clients and citizens can make reference to the University of Florida's
commitment and leadership in the use of recycled and
environmentally/socially preferable products.
• The University Purchasing and Disbursements Department will make
every effort to secure contracts with vendors that are socially and
environmentally conscientious, and certified green whenever
practicable.
• Purchasing and UF's Zero Waste by 2015 Goal
• Purchasing recyclable or products made out of recycled material is only
part of the life cycle, you must recycle whenever possible. If you are not

• Environmentally Preferable Products are products that have a lesser
impact on human health and the environment when compared with
competing products. This comparison may consider raw materials
acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, reuse,
operation, maintenance, or disposal of the product.
• Green Purchasing means purchasers take into consideration the
environmental impact of products when making purchasing decisions, giving preference to more environmentally friendly products when
quality and price are equal or superior.
• Recycled Products are products manufactured with waste material that
has been recovered or diverted from solid waste. Recycled material
may be derived from post-consumer waste (material that has served its
intended end-use and been discarded by a final consumer), industrial
scrap, manufacturing waste, or other waste that would otherwise have
been wasted.
• Sustainability means meeting today's needs without compromising the
ability of future generations to satisfy their needs.
• Waste Prevention means any action undertaken by an individual or
organization to eliminate or reduce the amount or toxicity of materials
before they enter the municipal solid waste stream. This action is
intended to conserve resources, promote efficiency, and reduce
pollution.
• Reuse means repairing what is broken or giving it to someone who can
repair it or use it in its current state.
• Reduce means using less of products and utilizing other means of doing
business when available to reduce the amount and toxicity of trash
discarded.
• Recycle means to reprocess and reuse used material.
• Life Cycle Evaluation is an evaluation of the major environmental
impacts in each life-cycle stage of a product category including resource
extraction, production, distribution, use, and eventual disposal or
recycling. The evaluation considers energy, resource use, and emissions
to air, water, and land, as well as other environmental and health
impacts. The purpose of this evaluation is to identify significant lifecycle
stages to be addressed.
• Life Cycle Cost Analysis is an economic evaluation technique that
determines the total cost of owning and operating a building or
equipment.
• Rechargeable means to replenish the amount of electric power in
something, especially a battery.
• Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is vendors taking on the
responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products through

UNL Procurement Services pursues the promotion, development and procurement of environmentally preferred goods and services whenever possible.  Procurement Services will work with departments, employees, contractors and vendors alike to seek out and provide resources and information that will enable our customers to make informed purchasing decisions, while promoting environmental stewardship.

UNL Procurement  Services is committed to buying more environmentally preferable  goods and services as long as they meet our performance needs and they are  available within a reasonable period of time at a reasonable cost. By including environmental   considerations in our procurement decisions, along with our traditional concerns with price, performance and availability, we will remain fiscally responsible while promoting products and services that have a reduced effect on human health and the environment.

UNL’s “Green Purchasing” strategy is to develop policies consistent with the following:

Minimize the consumption of natural resources by reviewing current and proposed future usage and evaluating the pros and cons of alternatives.
Seek alternatives to products and processes that are detrimental to the environment  by using more “environmentally friendly” products and processes.
Minimize waste, including any packaging, waste produced by the product (or service) in questions, and waste generated by the eventual disposal of the product.

Green purchasing is the method wherein environmental and social considerations are taken into account with the price, availability and performance criteria that we use to make purchasing decisions. 

Environmentally-preferable products have a reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared to other products and companies that serve the same purpose. It is the preference of Vanderbilt University that our suppliers use environmentally-preferable products, materials, and sources wherever economically feasible. If two products are competitive in performance characteristics and pricing, the university will favor the more environmentally-preferable product or company. 

The university and the supplier may negotiate during the contract term to permit the substitution or addition of environmentally-preferable products when such products are readily available at a competitive cost and satisfy the university’s performance needs. If a supplier is citing environmentally preferable product claims, the supplier must be able to provide proper certification or detailed information on environmental benefits, durability and recyclable properties. 

Procurement Services has worked closely with the university’s preferred office products, janitorial products, and laboratory products suppliers to provide more easily identified environmentally-preferable product selections. These products are readily identifiable in eProcurement and have been collected into special “green purchasing” catalogs that anyone can request.
A basic screen for environmentally-preferable products is to look for those that are reusable instead of disposable, recyclable, made with renewable energy, and contain a significant percentage of post-consumer waste recycled content. Additionally, third-party certification systems that indicate an environmentally-preferable product include: 
1. “Energy Star”: indicates a product has met strict energy efficiency guidelines as set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy (DOE). 
2. “EPEAT”: indicates electronics that are environmentally-preferable as determined by the EPA and Green Electronics Council. 
3. “FSC-Certified”: indicates products that have met the requirements of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for responsible management of forest resources, such as office paper. 
4. “SCS Recycled Content”: indicates a product that has been certified for recycled content and meets the stringent EPS standard for providing a measurable and significant environmental benefit over typical products in the same category. 
5. “CRI Green Label”: Product certified by the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) to improve indoor air quality. 
6. EPA Design for the Environment (DfE): EPA has screened each ingredient for potential human health and environmental effects and that-based on currently available information, EPA predictive models, and expert judgment-the product contains only those ingredients that pose the least concern among chemicals in their class. 
7. “Green Seal certified”: Products certified by Green Seal to meet environmentally-responsible design, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation requirements.
