Both offices also provide information to affected parties about on-campus and community-based support options such as counseling.

EDC discrimination response: Upon receipt of an oral or written complaint, the EDC director/Title IX officer conducts a preliminary investigation, including interviews with the complainant and the accused individual (""respondent"") and any relevant witnesses. If it is appears that immediate action is necessary to protect any/all involved parties from harm, university administrators and immediate supervisors are notified and actions deemed appropriate are taken. If the investigator concludes that the preliminary evidence indicates that university policy or law may have been violated, a full investigation is conducted in consultation with the appropriate supervisors.  Witnesses who may have information relevant to the complaint are interviewed. The investigator presents a summary report of the investigation to the appropriate administrator/supervisor. The investigator may make recommendations to the administrator/supervisor, but the administrator/supervisor has the ultimate responsibility to make the decision if disciplinary sanctions are warranted based on the totality of the situation. 

OSC response: All cases of student-on-student harassment are heard and resolved by the OSC through informal or formal means. During an informal resolution, the Conduct Review Officer will, in their professional judgment on the basis of the information provided or in consultation with appropriate University officials (e.g., Title IX Coordinator; University Housing; the Dean of Students), propose findings regarding any alleged violation(s) and may specify any sanction(s) described in this Code.

Our charge is to help build capacity around, and embed practices in, understandings of diversity, inclusion, and equity within academic affairs. This is accomplished through:

Re-envisioning of pedagogy and recognition of the validity and importance of student lived experiences, with the goal of creating inclusive classrooms through an equity asset-based framework.
Challenging dominant understandings of what is considered “academic” as a means to create more equitable institutional opportunities.
Reimagining how diversity and inclusion operates at Beloit College using an equity asset-based framework.
Academic diversity is the recognition that individual and group/social differences are central to the production and dissemination of academic knowledge. Inclusion demonstrates equity and social justice through awareness, understanding, and respect for differences in identity, culture, background, experience, and socialization, and the ways in which these forms of difference impact how we live and learn. Equity (as stated by the AAC&U) is the creation of opportunities for historically underrepresented populations to have equal access to, and participate in, educational programs that are capable of closing achievement gaps in student success and completion. Asset-based approaches recognize the importance, value, and strength of the lived experiences students bring to the classroom and use these experiences, skills and knowledge to create equitable engagement within the classroom.

We will realize these core values through three key actions:

Provide targeted, asset-based programming to ensure all students have an equitable inclusive space and place to live and learn at Beloit College.
Awareness and capacity building for faculty and staff centered on the importance of diversity and inclusivity in curricular and co-curricular activities.
Establishing benchmarks and measure progress through purposeful and ongoing research and assessment of campus activities around diversity, inclusiveness, and equity.
The Office of Academic Diversity and Inclusiveness sits within Academic Affairs and houses a number of different programs and initiatives focused directly on providing equitable access to higher education. The Student Excellence and Leadership (SEL) and the McNair Scholars Programs, both US Department of Education TRIO funded programs, use an asset-based model approach to work with students who are first-generation college, from low-income backgrounds, have a documented disability, and/or are domestic minorities. The Wisconsin Alliance for Minority Participation (WiscAMP) program works with minority students interested in science, technology, engineering and/or math (STEM). The Mellon Graduate School Exploratory Fellowship (GSEF) Program works with first-generation, low-income, underrepresented students in the humanities and social sciences that wish to attend graduate school. Finally, our Inclusive Success Initiative focuses more broadly on retention and institution-wide work around diversity, inclusion and equity.

The Senior Director of Academic Diversity and Inclusiveness oversees all programs housed under this office.",http://www.beloit.edu/oadi/,True,"""Personal harassment (“Harassment”) is verbal or physical conduct, including actions motivated by bias, that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual. Harassment may include behavior that targets an individual because of race, color, religion, sex, perceived, or actual sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, marital or family status, military or veteran status, citizenship or any other characteristic protected by law. Harassment also includes any kind of nonverbal, verbal, or physical conduct involving either intimidation or promise of reward where:

First-in-Family (FIF) Programs serves these students, and all students, by supporting them as they make the cultural leap into the college environment. First-in-Family is by definition a secondary identity. The FIF constituency hails from every corner of the socioeconomic spectrum, every ethnic background, and every area of study. The philosophy of FIF is that """"students don't know what they don't know."""" FIF Programs aims to introduce students to the huge variety of possibilities for their Columbia education.

Orientation: We hold a reception during the New Student Orientation Program (NSOP) to welcome new first-generation college students and their families to campus. The 2014 FIF Welcome Reception featured a panel discussion where five current FIF students shared their experiences with twenty-nine incoming students.

Peer Mentoring: FIF administers a peer mentoring program that pairs incoming and upperclass FIF students. The mentoring relationship enriches new students by connecting them with the attention and wisdom of FIF students who are farther along in their Columbia careers. The 2014-15 FIF Peer Mentoring Initiative will launch mid-September.
Social Events: All FIF students are invited to participate in FIF-exclusive social events throughout the academic year. Programming for the fall semester will be announced in early September.
Academic Support: The Center for Student Advising provides academic support resources through the Academic Resources in Support of Excellence (ARISE) program. All FIF students are encouraged to inquire about these resources.

",http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/OMA,True,"Bias and Discrimination Response Protocol

As members of Columbia College and Columbia Engineering, we share the University’s commitment to creating a learning environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment. Unfortunately, we acknowledge that no campus community is removed from larger systemic issues, such as racism, homophobia, religious intolerance, sexism, and classism.

Undergraduate Student Life and its partners have worked with students and key administrative offices to develop a protocol for responding to acts of hate and bias/discrimination in our community in order to better create a safe and secure environment for all of our students.

Students who witness, hear of, or are victim to acts of bias and hate should immediately contact Public Safety at 212-854-5555. Once Public Safety is notified, the Bias and Discrimination Response Team is alerted, and several steps are taken to respond to the needs of our community.

Public Safety

Once notified of an incident, Public Safety will provide any immediate assistance necessary regarding safety. If there is physical harm or threat of harm to individuals involved, Public Safety will provide appropriate support and action. If the act is in the form of public defacement of property, Public Safety will secure the premises and/or cover-up the area until:

thorough documentation is taken;
the defacement is removed by Facilities, a unit which also is contacted immediately after the initial report to Public Safety.
Documentation

Documentation by Public Safety includes formally taking an incident report and gathering information (e.g. taking photographs of defacement of property, interviewing victims or witnesses to an act).

If the incident may involve a hate crime, NYPD will be contacted. (See “Disciplinary Action for Hate Crimes and Bias Incidents” for more information).

Support

For individual(s) who may be specifically targeted:
Members of the Discrimination/Bias Response team (e.g. Multicultural Affairs, Residential Programs, Center for Student Advising) meet with the individual(s) to address the personal, physical, emotional, and psychological safety of those targeted. While providing ongoing support and referrals to additional resources as needed, the staff works with the student(s) involved in creating an appropriate community response. Depending on the nature of an incident, personal situation, and concern of safety, a student may not want wide publicity. In such cases, the University will be considerate of the student’s wishes and attempt to minimize and/or limit the publicity to the extent possible. However, reporting the incident will still help inform general community education programs and support services.

For a community or communities that may be targeted:
Members of the Discrimination/Bias Response team meet with members or organizational leaders of communities most immediately targeted by the bias-related act. In the initial meeting, students are alerted to the incident and have the opportunity to share their concerns and the concerns heard among their peers. Administrators will collaborate with students to create needed programs to support their communities internally as well as programs to educate the campus. Follow- up meetings to plan and implement programs, to provide ongoing support, and to continue dialogue are held as needed.

Notification

In addition to Public Safety notifying relevant administrative units and Undergraduate Student Life staff notifying targeted constituencies, outreach to the general CC/SEAS community takes place when appropriate. After meeting with, consulting, and receiving consent from the individual(s) or constituencies most affected, public notification (through email, floor meetings, or other forums) will be sent out to students describing the nature of the incident and reminding all that these acts are against the collective principles of our community. The amount of details about the incident that will be disclosed to the community will depend on several factors including but not limited to the decision of the students/ groups most targeted, level of concern that repeating exact details may re-victimize targeted person(s), and pending legal and judicial processes.

Campus Education

Response programming is informed and shaped by meetings with student leaders and individual(s) and communities most affected. Undergraduate Student Life staff and students collaborate to create relevant forums, town halls, and dialogues. Additionally, all documentation and records of incidents help inform future programming and improvement of existing programs and services. For instance, if biased or hateful behavior seems to stem from misinformation of particular communities’ cultures or experiences, new programming or better promotion of current resources can be implemented. Similarly, if a bias- related action continually occurs, educational campaigns and accompanying dialogues can be held.

Disciplinary Action for Hate Crimes and Discrimination/Bias Incidents

Hate crimes/ bias-related incidents involve behavior that is motivated by hostility to race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity and expression, age, or disability. We understand the deep pain and consequence hate crimes and discrimination/bias-related actions have on our entire community. Any behavior motivated by hate will not be tolerated. Columbia College and Columbia Engineering students involved in perpetrating a hate crime/ bias incident will be subject to an educational and/or disciplinary process determined by Judicial Affairs. Hate crimes are acts of hate and bias that are accompanied by crime through such actions as threats of violence, property damage, personal injury, and other illegal conduct. If a reported incident is designated by the NYPD as a hate crime, perpetrators will be prosecuted under state and federal laws. After a full investigation by the NYPD and the legal process are complete, Columbia College and Columbia Engineering students involved will also be subject to a judicial process through Dean’s Discipline, which may result in suspension or expulsion.

Confidentiality

Any personal information obtained during the course of an investigation of a hate crime or  discrimination/bias-related incident and/or adjudication of such matter will be handled with discretion and kept confidential to the extent possible.

Genesis is a pre-Orientation program for underrepresented students, including students of color and first-generation college students. The program is also open to any student with a strong commitment to advancing diversity and acting as an ally to underrepresented students at Connecticut College.

Attending a series of workshops, students are introduced to the academic and social support professionals on campus who represent the various offices and departments they should familiarize themselves with, including the Deans of Studies, Student Life, Multicultural Affairs and Financial Aid Services. A Cross-Cultural Understanding workshop explores how racial/ethnic diversity both challenges and enriches the experiences of African American, Latino/a, Asian American, Arab American, and Native American students on a predominantly white campus. Additional events throughout the day provide opportunities for students to create a sense of communal bonding among their peers and older students who will be serving as peer mentors via the ALANA Big Sisters/Brothers Program. By the end of the day, students will have begun to develop supportive relationships with peers and staff that will last throughout their freshman year and beyond. The program is not mandatory but is highly recommended.

ALANA Program:
ALANA (African American, Latino/a, Asian American and Native American) Sisters and Brothers (ASBs) are peer mentors who are selected and trained to assist first-year students adjust to, and successfully function within, Connecticut College. This adjustment process may result from the ASB's work in helping new students become oriented to the College, involved in student organizations and aware of campus resources. ALANA Sisters/Brothers are role models, resource persons and helpers. ALANA Sisters & Brothers Coordinators assist the Unity House director and staff by helping to organize, motivate, and support all ASB's.

CONN-ection Dinners:
At the beginning of the fall semester, we sponsor a dinner for each of the classes and invite deans, the Office of Career Enhancing Life Skills (CELS), the career services office,and other relevant administrators to meet the students. During these informal dinners, each class is reminded of the academic milestones they should be aware of for their particular class year. They are also informed about relevant resources and programs such as study-away information, the funded internship program and graduate and professional school application deadlines and processes.

R.I.S.E (Rising Into the Sophomore Experience):
""Rising Into the Sophomore Experience"" is designed to provide support and guidance to students during their sophomore year as they continue their transition process and are faced with making more permanent decisions, such as: choosing a major, applying to study abroad, whether to apply to a Center certificate program. A Unity House mentor will advise, guide and motivate you, help you set academic and personal goals and devise action steps to achieve them. RISE also offers workshops relevant to sophomore needs, and presents opportunities for leadership development through attendance at conferences and events on and off-campus.

Exodus:
The Exodus program is designed to provide support for underrepresented juniors and seniors in their transition to the ""real world"" after graduation. You'll receive guidance in creating a personal excellence plan to develop goals and an action plan to get on the right track for ultimate success after graduation. A Unity House mentor will give you one-on-one consultation on academic planning, leadership development, career or graduate school planning, and applying for jobs, internships and career preparation. Specific seminars, workshops, job fairs and programs/conferences of particular interest to graduating seniors are offered as well.

Cornell University,2016-03-18,2016-03-18 08:39:43,cma18@cornell.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"There are several programs throughout the university designed to support underrepresented groups within the student body.  The Office of Academic Diversity Initiatives provides support and guidance to students from underrepresented racial groups, low-income and first-generation college students.  Students can receive assistance and counseling for a variety of issues and the office acts as a resource and network for students helping to connect them across the campus.  This office works closely with the Center for Intercultural Dialogue, which is charged with strengthening the sense of community among the student body and providing student programs. There are also services provided at a macro level through the Dean of Students Office for students.

For assistance with writing, there is an ESL peer mentoring program through the Knight Writing Institute available to students.  This program offers a number of Writing Workshops across campus; students can attend drop-in hours and have someone work on a paper and review it for them to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. 

On a more micro level, each college and school has an office dedicated to its diverse student population.  Through this office, counseling and advising services are offered to its students, as well as mentoring in some programs and peer support and guidance in others.  The College of Engineering, for example, has Diversity Programs in Engineering (DPE).  Through this office, the students have regular appointments with the staff and advisors.  The staff advise several student lead organizations including the Society for Women Engineers (SWE), the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), and the National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE).

(SeePolicy 6.4, Prohibited Discrimination,Protected Status (Including Sexual) Harassment, and Bias Activity.) The system has received significant upgrades in 2015 and now extends to all campuses of the university and to all constituents.  This program is designed to supplement existing discrimination-related procedures and processes, and support the efforts of administrative units that address bias activity – such as the Cornell Police, the Office of the Judicial Administrator, the Title IX Coordinators, and the Office of the University Ombudsman. The primary goal of this program is to respond to bias activity by advising the university community of the occurrence of bias incidents and crimes, providing support-related resources to individuals who have experienced bias activity, tracking outcomes of bias reports, and developing programs that will help to prevent or eliminate bias activity. The program’s process is not intended to be punitive in nature. Anyone who directly witnesses or experiences bias activity (or finds evidence of or hears about past bias activity) on the Cornell campus or in an area that impacts the Cornell community should intervene in the moment as appropriate (e.g., contact  Campus Police at 911, if a crime is in progress, or interrupt the behavior in as much as the observer feels skilled and safe) and be sure to also complete this confidential report of the incident, as soon as possible.

Denison University is committed to being an inclusive community that is welcoming to all – a place that recognizes and celebrates difference. When an individual or group is disrespected or subjected to discrimination or other mistreatment because of a particular characteristic or their actual or perceived group membership, it has a negative effect on the entire campus community.  Every student, staff and faculty member has a rightful place at Denison and reported incidents of violence, intimidation, bullying, harassment and hate will be addressed with the intention of seeking a resolution that strengthens our community and upholds its members in their diversity.  

Student Development's Response Protocol for Bias and Hate-Related Incidents was created in June 2013 in order to have a mechanism for responding in a consistent and comprehensive manner to bias-related incidents that occur between students. Students, staff and faculty members were involved in the development and implementation of this protocol.

Denison Campus Reporting (CARE) Advisors are members of university staff and teaching faculty who have received specialized training to help students report and address incidents of disrespect, either as a harmed party or alleged offender.  These include incidents of bias-related behavior, violence towards others, and sexual misconduct.  CARE Advisors are also available to students involved in other types of conduct matters.  A harmed party reporting a bias-related incident to a Denison CARE Advisor may choose to be unnamed in a report unless something poses a threat to the campus community, someone is in immediate danger and/or menacing and/or a felony crime has occurred.  Denison CARE Advisors are private resources, meaning that they only share information with those who need to know the information to do their jobs proficiently. Harmed parties and alleged offenders who are named in the same bias-related report will work with different Denison CARE Advisors.

In FY 2014, this program focused on student athletes and transfer students. It is a specialized service that allows individuals to focus on their educational potential. This service assists students in taking charge of their academics by enhancing structure and accountability while providing new strategies and support. An academic coach will work individually with students on time-management, organization, goal setting, motivation, skill development, personal accountability, confidence building, stress management, and self-advocacy.  The coaching took two forms in 2013-2014: group coaching and individual coaching.

•	Group: Fall 2013. This program targeted GMC athletes as it was thought that they had low retention rates. This group received weekly meetings to discuss ways to achieve academic success. 29 students completed this program. 13/29 students were found to be Pell Grant eligible. Of that 13, nine had zero Estimated Family Contribution.  As defined by the VISTA standards, 17/29 students were considered to be “disadvantaged children and youth.” Disadvantaged children and youth are defined as: ""up to age 25 with exceptional or special needs (as defined in part 2552.81 of the DVSA), or who are economically disadvantaged and for whom one or more of the following may apply:  1) out-of-school youth who are unemployed, 2) in or aging out of foster care, 3) limited English proficiency, 4) homeless or have run away from home, 5) at-risk to leave school without a diploma and 6) former juvenile offenders or at risk of delinquency.”

• 	Individual: Fall 2013-Spring 2014.  This program worked individually with students to provide academic support. In the fall, the student athletes were the focus group. In the spring, the focus will be a mix of student athletes, transfer students, & students on academic probation.

Next fall the program will reach out specifically to ""low-income"" students, defined by certain federal standards (anyone Pell Grant eligible will qualify).  Over the past several years, this percentage has, for the most part, been increasing at GMC:
08/09 – 29.74% Pell Eligible Students at GMC
09/10 – 35.34% Pell Eligible Students at GMC
10/11 – 38.55% Pell Eligible Students at GMC
11/12 – 37.30% Pell Eligible Students at GMC
12/13 – 40.03% Pell Eligible Students at GMC
13/14 – 39.22% Pell Eligible Students at GMC

Additionally, the College supports peer-to-peer support clubs and training programs, such as Safe(r) Zone training, the Black Culture Club, and the PRANTS Club. 

Safe(r) Zone training is offered to all students, staff, and faculty at least once per year during the fall orientation and at other select times. Safe(r) Zone is a visible, voluntary support system for LGBT and queer GMC community members. Safe(r) Zone also acts as an educational resource for the GMC community on topics surrounding sex, gender, and sexuality. Participants in the program can become Safe(r) Zone certified and take home packets of information to help them navigate the topic and access additional resources. Additionally, offices can become certified and place stickers in prominent locations to display that the office is a safe(r) zone. 

The Black Culture Club engages the campus and surrounding communities in activities that promote multiculturalism and provides academic and social support to black students.

The PRANTS (People Really Are Not Their Sex) Club raises awareness about sexual identity and gender issues, while helping to mentor and provide resources to students facing challenges in this area.

Incidents are dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the Threat Assessment Team. Incidents are kept in a database and can be searched by key word to track frequency by type of event. 

Staff can also report incidents involving students to the Threat Assessment Team or through the retention module under the category of wellness/general concern. If reported through the retention module, other staff/faculty playing a mentoring role in the student's life will be notified and asked to provide support. 

As outlined in the staff handbook, staff who want to report an incident involving themselves or other staff members are encouraged to do so through Human Resources. If they are not comfortable reporting to Human Resources, they are asked to report directly to the Vice President of Finance and Administration. 

GMC is committed, and required by law, to take all appropriate steps to ensure that the matter is promptly investigated and addressed. The investigation will be conducted in such a way as to maintain confidentiality to the extent practical under the circumstances, with disclosure only on a need-to-know basis and/or as reasonably necessary to carry out the investigation and any remedial action. The investigation may include an interview with the person filing the complaint and the person alleged to have committed sexual harassment. Possible witnesses may be contacted, and other materials related to the complaint may be gathered. GMC reserves the right to take whatever steps it, in its sole discretion, it deems necessary to properly investigate a complaint. All employees must cooperate with any investigation. 

If it is determined that discrimination or harassment has occurred, GMC will act promptly to address the offending conduct and, when appropriate, impose disciplinary action. Any employee who has been found to have discriminated against or harassed another employee will be subject to disciplinary action, ranging from a verbal warning to immediate termination of employment. Individuals who engage in acts of discrimination or harassment may also be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

Workshops and Individual support is also provided during all 4 years for SAW students and other students who choose to utilize the program's services.",http://www.mills.edu/academics/undergraduate/saw/index.php,True,"Mills College is committed to creating and maintaining a community where all
individuals are treated with equality of opportunity, free from discrimination and
harassment. Mills College desires to promote healthy and respectful discourse and inquiry, and a living, learning, and working environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination, exploitation or intimidation; welcoming and valuing the full richness of our diversity, while working towards social justice. Decisions and behavior that a member of the community believes may violate this commitment may be addressed by using this Grievance Policy. Mills College will take prompt and effective corrective action when it concludes that there has been unlawful discrimination or harassment, or where its officers decide that it is important to take action to prevent a future such instance.
Grievance
A grievance under this Policy is accusation within the College, of a non-academic nature
about a decision or behavior on the part of a student, faculty member, staff or other
employee, or other individual associated with Mills College that the Grievant perceives to
create a harmful, living learning working environment, including, but not limited to, claims of discriminatory treatment or discriminatory impact, or bias-related incidents, in both cases where the Grievant believes that the decision or behavior resulted from perceived or actual hostility against the Grievant or a group because of race, color, sex, gender identity, gender presentation, disability, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, family status and/or spiritual/religious beliefs.

Bias-Related Incidents
These are incidents that are expressions of hostility against another individual (or group)
because of race, color, sex, gender identity, gender presentation, disability, sexual
orientation, age, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, family status and/or spiritual/religious beliefs and/, or because the perpetrator perceives that the other person (or group) has one or more of these characteristics. It also envisions instances of protected (but hateful or intolerant) speech that may generate harm, and thus may warrant College intervention. Bias-related incidents need to be addressed because they harm individuals and/or groups, undermine civility and understanding in the Mills community, as well as impede the educational process.

As part of our strategic imperative on inclusiveness, Mills College formed a Bias Response Team comprised of faculty, students and staff. This team is chaired by Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. The team will discuss issues of bias that arise on campus. The formation of the BRT illustrates the College's commitment to diversity and trust that we will continue to work together with mutual respect and integrity.

Hate Crimes
A hate crime, as the College considers it, is a criminal act that is committed against the
person or property of another because of the other person's actual or perceived race, color, sex, gender identity, gender presentation, disability, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, family status and/or spiritual/religious beliefs.
Hate crimes also include any such crimes committed against the property of a public agency or private institution - including educational facilities and advocacy groups - because the property of the agency or institution is identified or associated with a person or group of an identifiable race, color, sex, gender identity, gender presentation, disability, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, family status and/or spiritual/religious beliefs.

Retaliation
This Policy also prohibits retaliation against a person who makes a grievance under this
Policy or who participates in any manner in this procedure or any government inquiry into a matter that would be proper to be a grievance under this Policy. Retaliation includes, but is not limited to, threats, intimidation, reprisals, and/or adverse actions related to employment or education.",http://www.mills.edu/administration/administrative_offices/policies/documents/grievance-policy-and-procedures.pdf,True,True,--

age, marital status, veteran status, family care leave status, or any other basis described in this Document or otherwise prohibited by state or federal law destroy the foundation for such respect and violate the sense of community vital to the College’s educational enterprise.    Sexual misconduct offenses are a form of sexual
harassment and are strictly prohibited by the College. Retaliation against a person who reports, complains about, or participates in the investigation of a complaint of discrimination, harassment, and/or sexual misconduct is likewise prohibited.

This policy strictly prohibits discrimination against, or the harassment of, any individual at the College or at College activities occurring away from campus, including but not limited to all individuals regularly or temporarily employed, studying, or with an official capacity at Pitzer College (such as Trustees, guest lecturers, volunteers, and contractors).  
Persons violating this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge from employment or expulsion from the College.  It is the responsibility of all faculty, staff and students at the College to ensure compliance with this policy.   Accordingly, faculty, staff or students who believe they are being harassed, discriminated, or retaliated against, have observed harassment of, discrimination, or retaliation against, another person at the College in violation of this policy, or believe such conduct has occurred, should immediately report the incident following the complaint reporting procedures below.  

Because harassment, discrimination, and retaliation can also constitute violations of federal and state law (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and/or the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”) Section 12940, et seq. of the California Government Code), individuals who feel that they have been subjected to harassment or discrimination may, in addition to notifying the College by using the complaint reporting procedures below, file a complaint with the appropriate state or federal agencies.  Such complaints may be filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (“DFEH”) or the comparable federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”).    Complaints may also be filed with the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”).

The faculty and other academic appointees, staff, and students of Pitzer College enjoy significant free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section I of the California Constitution. This policy is intended to protect members of the College community from discrimination, not to regulate protected speech.

The College also has a compelling interest in unfettered inquiry, the collective search for knowledge, and insuring that faculty base their decisions about teaching, both inside and beyond the classroom, on their knowledge and best professional judgment.  The College thus affirms, and indeed embraces, principles of academic freedom as a special area of protected speech.  Consistent with these principles, no provision of this policy shall be interpreted to prohibit conduct that is legitimately related to the course content,
teaching methods, scholarship, or public commentary of an individual faculty member, or of the educational, political, artistic, or literary expression of students in classrooms and public forums.    Freedom of speech and academic freedom do not protect conduct (inclusive of speech) that violates federal or state anti‐discrimination laws.

HARAMBE is a cultural program that seeks to create a unifying event for entering African-American students, allowing them to build social and academic connections with peers, faculty, and staff.  The hope is that the event will result in a more connected class of incoming students better equipped to seek out institutional resources, peers and professionals on campus for support and guidance.

(2) Rice-Houston Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (Rice-Houston AGEP):
Rice University is one of many Texas universities that comprise the Rice-Houston Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (Rice-Houston AGEP) Program.  Situated in one of the nation's largest, most culturally diverse cities, the Rice-Houston AGEP unites many of the city's research and teaching universities and community colleges in the common mission of significantly increasing the number of underrepresented minority students earning the Ph.D. and positioning them to become leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.

(3) The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation was established as a nonprofit philanthropic organization in 1969. In 1988, the foundation made a commitment to help remedy the serious shortage of faculty of color in higher education through the Mellon Minority Undergraduate Fellowship Program (MMUFP). In 2003, the foundation broadened its mission and changed the program’s name to the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program to symbolically connect the mission to the stellar educational achievements of Dr. Benjamin E. Mays.
At Rice University, the fundamental objective of MMUFP is to increase the number of minority students, and others with a demonstrated commitment to eradicating racial disparities, who will pursue PhDs in core fields in the arts and sciences. The program aims to reduce the serious underrepresentation on university faculties of people of certain minority groups, as well as to address the attendant educational consequences of these disparities.

(4) Advocating Diversity and the Need for Cultural Exchange (ADVANCE): 
ADVANCE hosts weekly Friday discussion meetings.  The topics cover a wide range of social issues from sexism to homophobia to international concerns and politics, to name a few.  ADVANCE seeks to create an environment at Rice that emphasizes unity by embracing individual differences and is committed to providing a safe space to students interested in dialoguing on the often divisive issues of the day.

(5) Barbara Jordan Scholars: 
The Barbara Jordan scholarship program, named for the first black woman elected to the Texas Legislature and the United States Congress, provides support for a group of Rice freshmen who display the qualities of the late congresswoman.  The four-year half-tuition scholarships recognize deserving Rice students who distinguish themselves with activities and qualities she exhibited-including building bridges within and across racial, cultural and ethnic divides-and to maintain and enhance a campus learning environment that embraces civility and respect for the many facial and ethnic traditions that make up our society.

(6) Rice Nominators Circle: 
The Rice Nominators Circle, initiated in 1998, consists of K-12 teachers, counselors, administrators, and community leaders who assist Rice in identifying and reaching out to under-represented students of color.  Each year a new group visits Rice for an orientation and workshop about the admissions and financial aid process.  

(7) Cultural clubs: 
Rice sponsors a number of cultural clubs that support underrepresented groups including: The Black Student Association (BSA), The Black Graduate Association, The Chinese Student Association (CSA), The Hispanic Association for Cultural Education at Rice (HACER), The South Asian Society (SAS), The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), The Japanese Association of Students and Scholars (JASS), The Korean Student Association (KSA), The Muslim Student Association, The Vietnamese Student Association (VSA), The Rice Taiwanese Association (RTA), The Queers and Allies (Q&A), The Rice African Student Association (RASA), The Native American Student Association (NASA), and The Society of Women Engineers to name a few.

They are as follows:
INFORMAL RESOLUTION
In many instances, informal discussion and mediation can be helpful in resolving perceived instances of discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation. Problems are sometimes easier to resolve when an informal atmosphere encourages people to identify the problem, talk about it, and agree on how to deal with it. Merely discussing a complaint does not commit one to making a formal charge. Informal resolution may be stopped at any time in order to pursue the formal complaint process. Complaints of sexual violence will not be subject to mediation.
FORMAL COMPLAINT PROCEDURES
Any person who believes himself or herself to be the object of discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation involving a member of the faculty, staff, student body or other person affiliated with the University may choose, either initially or after having sought an informal resolution, to bring a complaint through the University’s formal procedures.

This is accomplished by being a full member in our community, enjoying the benefit of the full resources available including academic support, counseling, and pmonetary aid, and affirming that achievement for us transcends maintaining just passing grades. 

ASAP: The Academic Support and Achievement Program (ASAP) helps students learn how they learn best. The staff provides academic support to students (undergraduate and graduate) of all ability and achievement levels, through tutoring in writing, reading, math, time management and study skills. 
Students can receive academic support through ASAP in three ways: 
professional staff and professionally trained tutors deliver one-on-one instruction, small-group instruction, workshops and presentations; 
certified Peer Tutors offer in-person and online subject-specific sessions; and 
trained student leaders provide Supplemental Instruction for historically challenging courses.

Fearn Access Opportunity Programs (AOP) at SUNY Geneseo serves as the College's means of meeting the higher educational aspirations of academically talented students who are under-represented at the post-secondary level of education.  The programs that are united under the AOP department are the Arthur O. Eve Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the Transitional Opportunity Program (TOP).  While the programs serve different segments of society, they are similar in that they both provide educational access opportunities and academic support services to participants.  Eligibility for the EOP program is both academically and economically based and the program provides students with some financial support.  The TOP program, however, is not economically based, although TOP students may qualify for financial aid.
 
The Arthur O. Eve Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), a parallel of CUNY’s SEEK programs, was extended to the State University of New York in 1968 to provide higher education to traditionally by-passed residents of New York State. The program is aimed at students who have the potential to complete a college degree, but do not meet the general admission requirements because their academic credentials may have been adversely affected during their high school years by economic factors. Applicants are required to provide specific supporting and verifying documentation before admission decisions will be rendered. Specific state economic guidelines must be followed, and campus interviews may be required for some applicants.
 
The Transitional Opportunity Program (TOP) is a SUNY Geneseo sponsored program that includes many of the services commonly associated with EOP. Although the academic standards for admission are the same as for EOP, TOP applicants are not held to the same firm economic guidelines expected of EOP applicants. Most students qualify for the program because of the College’s interest in and commitment to expanding its student body to include the rich ethnic/racial, economic and age diversity of our society. Applicants applying for admission through this program shall be required to provide supporting documents to verify status and academic potential. Approximately 50% or more of TOP students qualify for financial aid.
 
Although applicants for the AOP department represent some of the brightest students in New York State, due to the high academic standards for admission, applicants seeking admission through AOP ordinarily do not satisfy one or more of the College's general admission requirements. Given their academic potential however, a more in-depth review of their academic credentials is used to assess their potential for success at SUNY Geneseo.  In addition to high school grades and standardized test scores, AOP applicants are required to complete and submit an AOP specific Part II Supplemental Application, an essay, and other supporting and veryifying documentation(e.g. counselor/teacher recommendations and a personal essay that discusses high school performance and educational goals) before an admission decision is rendered. In some cases, an on campus interview may be required for some AOP applicants. 

The Annual Multicultural BBQ/Mixer takes place during the college Week of Welcome. This is the opportunity to welcome students to the campus and for both students, faculty and staff to meet each other. This events is free and open to the campus community.

In honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services, in conjunction with a MLK Commemoration Committee, will remember Dr. King with an exciting semester of programs and activities to celebrate his life and legacy.

•	Daniel Acker Scholars Program (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/acker/index.php): Recruits underrepresented populations and provides financial support as well as academic mentoring during the scholars’ time at UB. 
•	Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Program (LSAMP) (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/ubstem/lsamp.php): A subset of the UB-STEM program which provides summer workshops, research seminars and faculty mentors to assists underrepresented groups from high school up until the procurement of their STEM field degree.
•	Student Support Services (SSS) (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/sss/index.php): A grant program that enables students to work with mentors, have access to technological resources, tutoring, and graduate school preparation.
•	Collegiate Science Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/cstep/index.php): Encourages the participation of underrepresented groups in science and technology by offering students the opportunity to become more knowledgeable about career fields through internships and research opportunities.
•	Access to College Excellence Program (ACE) (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/ace/index.php): A transitional program designed for underrepresented freshmen and sophomore students to ensure that the students have a successful academic career at UB.
•	Arthur O. Eve Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/eop/index.php): Assists struggling students who have limited college opportunities due to their educational or economic circumstances. This program grants students access to resources such as summer preparation, counseling, financial aid, and research opportunities. 
•	Cora P. Maloney College Peer Mentorship Program (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/pmp/index.php): Successful upperclassmen students aid incoming freshmen with adjusting to college life so that they can make the most of their college experience.

In addition to strengthening academic and financial support of underrepresented populations, UB is taking the necessary steps to make the campus more welcoming and comfortable for underrepresented groups. The institution provides a wellness education services program (http://wellness.buffalo.edu/wes/lgbtqresources.php) that addresses the various needs of students on campus and provides supportive resources for the LGBTQ community as well as students with disabilities. The campus offers gender neutral housing to accommodate the needs of trans-gendered and transitioning students, as well as single stall restrooms on campus. 

Finally, The Intercultural & Diversity Center (IDC) is committed to offering high quality programs, events and activities that celebrate UB's diversity and educate our community on topics such as appreciating our commonalities and differences, the role identity plays in our lives and how to be an advocate. The IDC's mission is to support all students in their personal development, create a sense of belonging, celebrate diversity, and discuss issues that broaden a student's perspective.
This is accomplished by:
-Offering students various opportunities to engage in dialogue to develop a respect and appreciation for the different identities, backgrounds and cultures of UB students, staff and faculty.
-Promoting an educational environment for students to gain leadership skills and build relationships with faculty, staff, students and community members.
-Celebrating and promoting an environment of personal and academic growth for all students and specific mentoring programs for underrepresented students to gain experience, support and guidance for a successful college experience.
-Collaborating among the IDC and other departments, students and student organizations on campus to enhance educational benefits for students.",http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/,True,"Along with providing support services for students from underrepresented backgrounds, the university also has a discrimination and harassment policy and reporting system so that the institution can address incidents of bias or discrimination against its students, faculty, and staff. The university’s policy regarding bias and discrimination is available to the public via the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion website (http://www.buffalo.edu/equity.html). The Discrimination and Harassment policy specifically states that the University at Buffalo opposes differential treatment of individuals based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, gender, pregnancy, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status, or military status. In the event that an individual should experience harassment or discrimination, Judicial Affairs & Student Advocacy (http://www.student-affairs.buffalo.edu/judicial/) are responsible for enforcing campus policies and provides guidelines to the campus community concerning how one should proceed with reporting an incident. Under these guidelines, students are encouraged to contact university police for issues pertaining to physical confrontation and urged to contact the office of student affairs for all other incidents. In addition to UB’s discrimination policies and response strategies, the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion also provides training sessions for unlawful harassment prevention.  Within the last three years, Judicial Affairs & Student Advocacy has handled cases pertaining to students as well as staff. Penalties imposed upon individuals who violate the policy include: suspension, restraining orders, and exclusion from commencement exercises.",http://www.buffalo.edu/equity.html,True,True,"Also see: http://www.student-affairs.buffalo.edu/idc/

"University of California, Davis",2016-03-28,2016-03-28 16:31:32,cmkirk@ucdavis.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The Cross Cultural Center is charged with retention of underrepresented students. The center fosters understanding of and appreciation for the cultures, traditions and histories reflected in the campus community, as well as social justice.  The CCC sponsors multicultural arts and educational programs, symposia, workshops, seminars, lectures, exhibits and performances. Additionally, the department develops and fund opportunities for  undergraduates and graduates to enhance their leadership potential. The CCC serves as a community center for the students, faculty and staff at UC Davis. The CCC provides a safe space for community members to explore themselves as well as learn about ethnicity/race and culture.

The Cross Cultural Center collaborates with other campus departments such as the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource Center, the Student Recruitment and Retention Center, the Women's Research and Resource Center, Educational Outreach Program (EOP), AB540 and Undocumented Student Center, and Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS). The CCC has its own community counselor housed at the CCC who is a part of the Community Advising Network (CAN). 

UC Davis’ Office of Campus Community Relations has a Diversity Education Program, which includes a Diversity Trainers Institute and provides the following services:
- Training workshops, presentations, courses and other educational activities that enhances further understanding of the multicultural nature of our campus community.
- Consultation to administration, faculty, staff and students on federal and state laws and regulations as well as about university policies and procedures regarding diversity, affirmative action and equal employment opportunity, hate crimes, and other matters related to fostering a respectful campus climate.
- Referrals to appropriate service departments for university and community members with concerns and/or complaints.

The Office of Campus Community Relations also has a “Living the Principles of Community” online course which covers topics of discrimination, sexual harassment, affirmative action and diversity along with the University's policies governing these issues. Through realistically subtle and complex scenarios, learners discover that there is more than one ""right"" way of preventing, managing and resolving conflicts related to these topics. The course informs and equips participants with essential knowledge and skills, ultimately resulting in fewer such conflicts, improved morale, decreased institutional liability, and a more respectful and inclusive campus environment.

UC Davis Student Housing has living-learning communities focused on different underrepresented groups, including an African American/African community, Asian Pacific American community, Chicano-Latino community, Native American community, and Rainbow (LGBT) community. All of these communities provide a safe and supportive living environment for residents and help connect them to campus resources. Some of the communities have additional student staff (Cultural Programmers) that provide programming on the community’s theme and some also offer a seminar that can be taken for academic credit based on the theme.

During Summer Orientation Student Housing partners with EOP to provide sessions for underrepresented students. Student Housing also provides materials in multiple languages and makes translation services available for students’ families. Free housing is provided to Guardian Scholars (students involved in the foster care system) when the residence halls are closed during the winter break.

Student Housing partners with a variety of campus departments, including the Cross Cultural Center and LGBTRC, to provide programming in the residence halls and help create communities that are inclusive of traditionally underrepresented groups.

The Center for Leadership Learning provides regular workshops on leadership and professional development topics, including diversity. Workshops are facilitated by student interns, professional consultants, and staff from other campus departments, such as the LGBTQIA Resource Center. One workshop example is ""Who's Got Your Back?: Finding Connection and Community."" This workshop is focused on how students build relationships in the context of their own identities and the UC Davis environment. Students looked closely at the process of building community for themselves, as building social support is a good way to navigate difficult times.

UC Davis ADVANCE, which promotes women in academic STEM fields, is funded by an Institutional Transformation grant that began in September of 2012. The program is supported by the National Science Foundation’s ADVANCE Program which aims to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. Advancing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) is a priority nationally, for the State of California, and at UC Davis. Research has shown that adverse educational and workplace climate, specifically in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines, is a barrier to attracting and retaining diverse populations, including underrepresented minorities, in those fields. 

The UC Davis ADVANCE program is rooted in the premise that a multiplicity of perspectives derived from both gender and cultural diversity can increase STEM research innovation by seizing the advantages that a heterogeneous group of talented individuals can bring to problem-definition and problem-solving. UC Davis ADVANCE program has a four-pronged approach to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers:
- Build a vibrant, welcoming and diverse STEM research community through establishment of the “Center for Advancing Multi-cultural Perspectives on Science” (CAMPOS)
- Establish an institution-wide, inclusive STEM climate that values diversity
- Promote equitable career advancement among STEM faculty
- Understand barriers and catalysts for Latinas in STEM

The Student Academic Success Center houses a number of programs geared toward supporting various student communities including former foster youth, first generation, low income, undocumented students and other groups that are underrepresented in higher education. Transition assistance, retention services and research opportunities are provided through the efforts of programs such as the Educational Opportunity Program, the Guardian Scholars Program, the Linda Frances Alexander Scholars Program, Mentorship for Undergraduate Research in Agriculture, Letters and Science (MURALS), the Special Transitional Enrichment Program and the TriO Scholars Program. Using a holistic approach, these programs aim to enhance student learning and create an environment that promotes academic success, social engagement and personal development. The ultimate goal is to help students successfully advance through their undergraduate years and beyond.

The Student Recruitment and Retention Center works toward educational equity. Their  student-run and student-initiated programs foster holistic academic and personal development while raising political and cultural awareness thus empowering students to act as dynamic leaders for their communities. They strive to create a society that provides a quality, culturally sensitive, comprehensive education for students of all backgrounds. They have seven programs: African Diaspora Cultivating Education (ACE), American Indian Recruitment and Retention (AIRR), Pilipino/a Outreach & Retention (BRIDGE), Collective: Student Support and Empowerment, Graduate Academic Achievement & Advocacy Program (GAAAP), Southeast Asians Furthering Education (SAFE), and Yik'al Kuyum (Chican@/Latin@ Holistic Student Support Program).

In Winter and Spring 2014 Graduate Studies hosted Diversity Dialogues on Graduate Education to discuss how to empower underrepresented graduate groups such as women in STEM, international students, students with disabilities, students of color, undocumented students, LGBTQIA identified students, student veterans, and student parents, and support them in the challenges they face. There were six sessions in total and various members of the campus administration also attended.

UC Davis Preferred Name Service: UC Davis recognizes that many of its students use a name other than their legal name. As long as the use of a preferred name is not for the purpose of misrepresentation, the university acknowledges that a preferred name should be used whenever possible in the course of university business and education.

Therefore, the university will permit any student who wishes to choose to identify themselves within the university’s information systems with a preferred name in addition to their legal name. It is further understood that the student's preferred name should be used in university communications and reporting, except where the use of the legal name is necessitated by university business or legal requirement.

The UC Davis Police Department is a national leader, too, with a closely related policy that took effect last fall. The policy affirms that preferred first names may be used on campus, so long as they are not being used for the purposes of misrepresentation; and instructs officers to interact with people using their preferred names and with respect for gender self-identity and expression.

The UC Davis Guardian Professions Program, housed in the Office of Graduate Studies, is a scholarship and mentorship program launched during Fall 2014 that helps former foster youth receive graduate and professional degrees at UC Davis. It is the first program of its kind in the nation. Students receive help from staff members for any of the graduate programs and professional schools at UC Davis and financial support, such as fellowships, to help cover tuition. Additionally, the program covers the cost of applying to a UC Davis graduate program. 

The Guardian Scholars Program in the Student Academic Success Center is its undergraduate counterpart, and is dedicated to helping former foster youth receive undergraduate degrees at UC Davis.

Faculty, staff and students are invited to affiliate with any of the six Chancellor’s Status Committees. These committees are open to all members of the campus community. Each committee designates a faculty member and an administrative staff member as co-chairs.  The Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity provides administrative support and the Chancellor’s office maintains a budget for each status committee.  The six Chancellor's Committees are focused on the status of: Asian Americans; Blacks; Latinos; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Transgender, Queer People and Allies; Persons with Disabilities; and Women.

The Chancellor’s Committee on the Status of Blacks (CCSB) serves as an advisory body on matters pertaining to the academic, professional, and social aspects of African and African American life at UIC. CCSB addresses issues relating to campus governance, employment practices, public relations, student affairs and other issues that affect the well being of Blacks on campus.  The committee works collaboratively with UIC’s diverse community.

The Chancellor's Committee on the Status of Asian Americans (CCSAA) is dedicated to promoting the academic, social, cultural and professional welfare of UIC’s Asian American faculty, staff and students. We address issues related to work and pay, recruitment and retention, and quality of life.

The Chancellor's Committee on the Status of Women (CCSW) works to improve the status of women at UIC with a primary objective to advise and make recommendations to the Chancellor regarding attitudes, policies, and procedures that affect women faculty, staff and students. The committee will undertake projects and will also recommend changes in campus structures, policies and programs as appropriate.

The mission of the Chancellor's Committee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities is to promote empowerment and inclusion of faculty, staff and students with disabilities at UIC. CCSPD recognizes that people with disabilities are a diverse group, including individuals with visible and non-visible disabilities. This mission is motivated by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the university, not liabilities.

The mission of the Chancellor's Committee on the Status of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues is to provide leadership on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues in UIC communities. This includes addressing needs of staff, faculty, students and alumni of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.

The University’s diversity vision statement sets the stage for a campus where diversity is celebrated and civility is expected. It states:
“The University of Louisville strives to foster and sustain an environment of inclusiveness that empowers us all to achieve our highest potential without fear of prejudice or bias.
We commit ourselves to building an exemplary educational community that offers a nurturing and challenging intellectual climate, a respect for the spectrum of human diversity, and a genuine understanding of the many differences-including race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, disability, religion, national origin or military status-that enrich a vibrant metropolitan research university.
We expect every member of our academic family to embrace the underlying values of this vision and to demonstrate a strong commitment to attracting, retaining and supporting students, faculty and staff who reflect the diversity of our larger society.”

While valuing freedom of thought and expression, and multiple points of view, we recognize that some members of our campus community are affected by instances of bias and hate and need assistance. The Bias Incident Response Team (BIRT) is a group of faculty and staff who are committed to creating a proactive response for students, faculty and staff to instances of hate and bias in the following ways:
-    Support those who are targeted by hate or bias.
-    Refer them to the resources and services available.
-    Educate the campus community about the impact of hate and bias.
-    Promote initiatives and new ideas that further a welcoming, bias- and hate-free climate at U of L.

ACP is a competitive program. It can only accept about 20 UT Arlington mentors annually who will assume a number of roles, including communicator, coach, navigator, developer and adviser to their assigned veteran protégé.

The program targets all veterans who have served on active duty since 2001, including those returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Spouses of severely wounded or deceased veterans may also apply as protégés.

The initiative is part of UT Arlington's commitment to aiding military men and women returning to college. Military veteran enrollment is up more than 20 percent since fall 2008. UT Arlington's Veterans Benefits Office works daily to assist veterans as they transition to college life. 

As higher education ACP role models, UT Arlington mentors will be able to provide a unique and important community service to veterans.  If you are interested in participating in the ACP program, please apply by Oct. 15, 2009.

Here's how it works:

From the DDCE Impact Report 2009: http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/pdf/DDCE_ImpactReport.pdf

Another important undergraduate resource is the Gender and Sexuality Center. 

Established in 2004, the mission of the Gender and Sexuality Center (GSC) is to provide safe spaces for all members of the UT Austin community to explore, organize, and promote learning around issues of gender and sexuality. The center also facilitates a greater responsiveness to the needs of women and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities through education, outreach, and advocacy. The center, now part of DDCE, is guided by a strategic plan developed by the center’s staff and members of the GSC’s Advisory and Working Group comprised of students, faculty, and staff, and community members who also provide feedback,
conduct outreach, and evaluate programs and services. One of the center’s major goals is to contribute to the successful transition of first-year students to the UT community and ensure students’ graduation, as well as integrate women and LGBTQ students into campus life and improve the efficacy of LGBTQ and women student leaders.

From the DDCE Impact Report 2009.

For students in residence halls: 

The Division of Housing and Food Service in Student Affairs (not DDCE) employs an Assistant Director for Diversity and offers several programs focused on students living in residence halls (nearly 8,000 of 30,000 undergraduates, and the majority of the freshman class every year). 

For first-generation college attendees, the Gateway Program and Longhorn Link:

The Gateway Program was started at The University of Texas at Austin in the fall of 1994 to maximize the academic success and social connections of new first generation and underrepresented students at UT Austin. Gateway Scholars has expanded to include UTransition, a learning community for first generation and underrepresented transfer students, the Achieving College Excellence (ACE) Program, a service for students who seek additional academic assistance, and the Welcome Program, a diversity education program for incoming first-year students, and Longhorn Connection.

The Longhorn Link Program - Student Support Services - is a federally funded TRiO program. This program is funded under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The University of Texas at Austin was awarded funding in the Fall of 2001. The program provides opportunities for academic development, assists students with basic college requirements, and serves to motivate students towards the successful completion of their post secondary education. The goal of the Longhorn Link Program is to increase the college retention and graduation rates of its participants and facilitate the process of transition from one level of higher education to the next.

Returning students of color are matched with new students of color.  Mentors work with their protégées on making the transition to a predominantly white college in a rural setting as well as sharing study strategies and offering assistance with time management. Other support programs (described here) are available to all students; however, a special effort is made to reach out to at-risk and under-resourced students. The Supplemental Instruction (SI) program available to all students offers weekly study sessions led by successful students for courses that are traditionally challenging for students.  The Mathematics lab is a drop-in service staffed primarily by upper-division math and math education majors.  They offer small-group and individual assistance to students in six different entry-level math classes.  The Writing/Reading/Speaking Lab (WRSL) offers assistance to students in reading comprehension and retention and at all stages of the writing process.  They offer feedback to students writing and delivering speeches.  Academic advising is available to all students to help them assess their interests, value, personality, and skills and match those to appropriate academic programs.

The International Student Programs Office, Saemann Student Center 185, provides services to international students and seeks to promote global understanding through campus, intercollegiate, and community outreach.  The primary role of the International Student Programs Office is immigration advising to ensure that foreign nationals maintain proper immigration status with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and compliance operations for Wartburg College.  The office also provides a new international student orientation, material support, and advising on employment, Social Security, health insurance, and cross-cultural communication.  Additionally, the office coordinates the Friendship Family program, which pairs local families with international students, and Global Connections, a student-led initiative to increase cultural competence on Wartburg’s campus through peer-mentoring programs and more. 

The Student Diversity Programs Office develops and promotes multicultural programming and activities to help all students understand and appreciate differences. The director promotes academic success by providing academic guidance, personal support, cultural resources and leadership opportunities to enhance the educational experience and facilitate the academic and personal growth of American ethnic students. The department recognizes the richness of diversity as a part of the Wartburg College experience and assists with the promoting of diverse ideas, cultures and opportunities that support student success.

Each tier is designed to address particular developmental milestones associated with that phase of a student's matriculation.

Western Michigan University's Steps Toward Exhibiting Mastery Program is designed to promote student success and to increase college graduation rates for academically and economically disadvantaged students. Eligible students are provided academic support through tutoring, mentoring, counseling, advising, multicultural activities, educational seminars, career and graduate school planning, and other resources designed to enhance their education and college experience, as well as to enable them to achieve a post-secondary degree. Funding for this program is provided by the State of Michigan King-Chávez-Parks Initiative.

The purpose of the Western Michigan University College Assistance Migrant Program is to provide academic and financial support to assist migrant and seasonal farmworkers or their children in successfully completing their first undergraduate year at the University and continuing in their post-secondary education.

Together, this unit seeks to strengthen Williams College’s commitment to inclusion by ensuring that diversity initiatives are advanced and celebrated.

The Davis Center serves as a nexus, linking communities, galvanizing individuals. It provides a context for incisive, mobilizing, transformative interactions—planned and impromptu—that contribute to the advancement of diverse social identities, particularly those defined by race, ethnicity, class, gender, religion, ability and sexual orientation.

Through collaborative efforts with faculty, staff and students the Center bolsters critical thinking, facilitates meaningful dialogue and precipitates multilateral exchange throughout the Williams College community. The result is empowerment—fundamental to leadership and essential to social change.

Affinity groups include the Chinese-American Student Organization, Koreans of Williams, South Asian Students Association, Black Student Union, International Club, Muslim Student Union, Queer Student Union,Vista (Latinos at Williams), Williams College Jewish Association, and the Women's Center.  

The Office of Special Academic Programs helps all students, regardless of background,  thrive academically at Williams.  While OSAP’s work concerns itself generally with eradicating racial and socio-economic disparities in higher education, it focuses on several specific programs.

The Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship (MMUF) and the Williams College Undergraduate Research Fellowship (WCURF) work to increase racial and socio-economic diversity in higher education by preparing students from underrepresented groups for academic careers.  Both fellowships provide opportunities for faculty-mentored research, preparation for graduate school, and individualized support from the Office of Special Academic Programs.

The Summer Humanities and Social Sciences program (SHSS) is a 5-week program for talented incoming first year students with a passion for the humanities or social sciences who are from underrepresented minority groups and/or who are first-generation college students.  The program has two main goals: First, it provides its students with a preview of the Williams experience and familiarizes them with some of the extraordinary academic opportunities the college offers.  Second, we hope that the glimpse of research and teaching afforded by our faculty and Teaching Assistants will inspire some of our students to consider a career in one of the academic fields of the humanities and social sciences.",http://davis-center.williams.edu/,True,"If you feel you have experienced an incident that could be either discrimination or sexual harassment/misconduct, talking about the incident soon thereafter with an official representative may be helpful.

Office of Strategic Planning and Institutional Diversity
To fulfill its mission, Williams must continually foster a community in which members from all backgrounds can learn, live, and thrive. The Office of Strategic Planning and Institutional Diversity has primary responsibility for overseeing and coordinating that effort.

We collaborate with faculty, staff, students, alumni, and senior leadership, including trustees, to develop strategies and implement programs to advance issues of inclusion. Key initiatives currently include:

increased recruitment and retention of a diverse student body, faculty and staff
more effective and inclusive processes for staff assessment and professional development
programs that promote inclusive academic excellence
increased engagement with emerging alumni populations
pipelines to strengthen diversity within the Board of Trustees
The Office serves as a resource for all members of the College community in addressing grievances and issues of discrimination and sexual harassment/misconduct.
