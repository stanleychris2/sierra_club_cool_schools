MIT advances the use of alternative commuter transportation to and from campus, seeks to minimize air travel, and deploys efficient, low-emission vehicles in its campus fleet in order to reduce environmental impact associated with transportation emissions and promote a healthy, interconnected community. 

Getting to and from campus
MIT has implemented a variety of programs to encourage its students, faculty, and staff to get to and from campus using alternative transportation – such as biking, using public transportation, carpooling, and car-sharing. These programs have earned MIT the EPA’s “Best Workplace for Commuters” designation. Read more about resources available to staff, students, and faculty at MIT’s Commuter Connections. 

MIT’s vehicle fleet
MIT is committed to maintaining an efficient fleet of vehicles that run on alternative fuel. Campus shuttles currently are fueled with a commercial biodiesel and in 2011, the Department of Facilities introduced into its fleet its first all-electric full-service vehicle, a Ford Transit Connect modified by Azure Dynamics. With a range of 50-80 miles and a top speed of 75 mph, the vehicle will be used by MIT Mail Services and monitored for its performance.

MIT has made continuous efforts to “right size” its vehicle fleet by replacing 6- and 8-cylinder vehicles with fuel efficient and alternative fuel vehicles. The Institute has also collaborated with the City of Cambridge to retrofit diesel vehicles with pollution control devices.

Electric vehicle charging stations
In 2012, MIT began installing ChargePoint networked electric vehicle charging stations for use by the MIT community and the public. Charging stations are currently located at building WW15 (2 stations for 4 parking spots), Building 46 (2 stations for 4 parking spots), and Building 32 (1 station for 1 parking spot).  These installations are intended to advance regional infrastructure to support the adoption of electric vehicles through a collaborative program with the City of Cambridge. MIT plans to add additional charging stations in the spring of 2014, for a total capacity to charge 25 electric vehicles on campus.",http://sustainability.mit.edu/sustainability-today/campus-systems?qt-campus_systems=3#qt-campus_systems,"Fleet inventory is drawn from the MIT GHG inventory conducted by Alex Marks.

The remaining campus fleet vehicles are managed centrally by the Land, Buildings & Real Estate Department (LBRE) and are steadily moving towards PEV and PHEV vehicles where the vehicle duties allow. The campus Fleet Manager is in the midst of compiling a strategic plan to move the campus fleet towards fully electric or non-motorized modes of transportation over the next several years.

As part of that plan, LBRE has led a transition to bicycles and electric bicycles rather than adding new motorized vehicles in the fleet, and other departments have followed suit. LBRE now has 8 bikes in the motor pool: 6 priority pedal bikes, and 2 electric bikes. There are also 10 pedal bikes in the Science & Engineering Quad district and another 11 pedal bikes in the Cubberly Education Building district. Bikes will also be added in lieu of fleet vehicles at the other distributed LBRE districts across campus.

There are also electric bikes in the LBRE shops: 1 in architecture trades, 1 in the plumbing shop, 1 in material management (used for parts deliveries) and 1 in events services. All electric bikes (except for the e-bike in events services) have GPS. To date, the e bikes have been ridden 208 miles altogether, which has helped the campus avoid 47kg of carbon dioxide equivalent.

•	Adopted a green fleet plan
•	Implemented better tracking and analysis of fleet data, including data on fuel use
•	Replaced vehicles when due for replacement, to minimize repair costs and fuel use
•	“Right-sized” the fleet in all vehicle classes (light, medium and heavy duty), by choosing smaller, more efficient vehicles suited to the task
•	Trained staff on fuel management and fuel-efficient driving practices
•	Purchased electric bikes with detachable trailers, used by trades staff on campus
•	Integrated alternative fuel infrastructure including B5 biofuel, electric vehicle charging stations, and a CNG fueling station.

Approximately 15% of the current light-duty fleet is low emission, and that is expected to increase by at least an additional 5% in the coming years. There are plans to have 25% of the light-duty fleet be low-emissions by the year 2025, however this proposal is still in theworks. We arecurrently committed to 20% by 2020. It is important to note that Department of Energy reporting standards place public safety vehicles in a different category. 

(http://today.uconn.edu/blog/2013/09/uconn-getting-green-for-going-green/)

UConn has also worked to reduce the oil dependency of its fleets through the installation of an electric vehicle charging station at the university’s Motor Pool Lot, where the school charges its heavy-duty electric vehicle van. This station has positive implications for the environment since the fleet’s van, which charges there overnight, has no CO2, NOX, or particulate emissions. The van is used for all campus deliveries, replacing a diesel truck formerly used.
(http://www.ecohusky.uconn.edu/transportation/electric-vehicles.html)
Adding onto UConn’s EV friendliness, this past year the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) agreed to fund the installation of two more electric vehicle charging stations on campus. The two additional charging stations are to be installed in both of the parking garages – one in North Parking Garage and another in South Parking Garage – and will be free of charge for all users.

In addition, UConn continues its efforts to support alternative fuel and power technology in its motorized fleet by encouraging all
departments to choose from the preferred vehicle list whenever they are purchasing or leasing University vehicles (http://ecohusky.uconn.edu/transportation/2008-preferred-purchases.html). The vehicles listed are based off of ranking estimates of EPA fuel economy (city mpg) and emission standards, and aim to reduce
emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases.

",http://ecohusky.uconn.edu/transportation/index.html,"The University does have additional plated vehicles that were not counted above because they are farm equipment (including tractors, horse trailers, etc.), not passenger vehicles. There are approximately 120 farm vehicles used by the University.

Additionally, the University maintains fleet fuel standards in compliance with CT Public Act 2007-242, which requires all vehicles purchased to be in the top third fuel efficiency of their class.

Finally, the University discontinued its longstanding production of ASTM-certified biodiesel made from waste cooking oil collected from the University’s dining facilities.  The biodiesel was produced using a continuous flow reactor in a Chemical Engineering professor’s lab.  This practice had previously resulted in a <5% biodiesel blend used at all times throughout UConn’s diesel fleet.  Unfortunately, after a spill in the lab, the production was discontinued for safety reasons. UConn is evaluating the feasibility of purchasing a commercial biodiesel blend (B20) for use full-time in its diesel fleet and certain emergency generators.

As of November 2015, it operated a fleet of 33 CNG vehicles including transit buses, bi-fuel pickup trucks and passenger cars. In FY 2015, CNG vehicles logged over 260,000 miles and used over 56,000 gas gallon equivalents of CNG (replacing primarily diesel/B20).

The use of CNG in the UNH fleet over the past 15 years has reduced an estimated 1500 tons of CO2 emissions and 125,000 gallons of gas/diesel fuel consumption with an estimated fleet fuel savings of over $250,000
With current market price of CNG, the fuel cost savings for this CNG fleet to UNH was approximately $34,500 in FY 15.
Transit is our biggest CNG user. In FY 15, approx. 36% of UNH transit miles were being run on CNG.
FY 15's CNG utilization was 20% of overall campus fleet fuel share

UNH worked cooperatively with the New Hampshire DOT to coordinate the first ultra-low sulfur B20 fuel supply at any state operated fueling facility. In August 2006, the facility, located at the UNH campus, opened and UNH began a conversion of all of its diesel fleet to year-round B20 operation.

In FY 2007, most diesel transit vehicles switched to B20 and UNH took possession of its first dedicated B20 fueled, California Air Resource Board Certified (CARB) low emission buses. In succeeding years, UNH Transit embarked on balanced fleet procurement - half B20 and half CNG. 

UNH continues a transition of all post-1990 diesel vehicles to B20. As of July 2012, UNH had migrated over 90% of its diesel fleet to year-round B20. This transition has equated to a petroleum diesel consumption reduction of just over 90,000 gallons and estimated emission savings of 2000 tons of CO2 with only minor incremental fuel cost increase. 

CNG and B20 are the focus alternative fleet fuels at UNH. (see attached) The UNH Transit Fleet runs almost 40% on CNG fuel in terms of net miles.  The remaining 60% is virtually all B20 biodiesel year round.

program will provide the University’s fleet operation valuable feedback and insight in the use of alternative fuels, advanced vehicles, funding opportunities, and new technology news and events, as the University continues its effort in becoming a more sustainable higher education institution.",http://www.uwosh.edu/fleet/vehicle-usage,The fleet vehicles have recently been sold and will not be included in future reports.

All 5 E-Ride vehicles that are on campus are owned by Facility Services.  The vehicle used for the mailroom was purchased in 2012 with a grant from State of Wisconsin, Department of Administration- State Energy Office.  The Mailroom gave its pre-existing electric vehicle to Central Stores for campus deliveries.  The ability for Central Stores to use an electric vehicle for small deliveries versus only having access to 2006 Ford box truck has reduced fuel consumption for the Facility Services department which oversees both Mailroom and Central Stores.  An environmental benefit to using the E-Ride vehicles is the use of less fuel needed for campus errands. The amount of alternative fuels used by program vehicles averages 134 KwH monthly while they travel an average of 230 miles/month. Fuel costs and savings are approximately $10.00/month for Facility Services.",--,--
