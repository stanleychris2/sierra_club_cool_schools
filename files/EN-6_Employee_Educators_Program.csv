The program helps to train and foster staff sustainability leaders within a department and provides resources to guide the process of greening their workplace.  Green Workplace Certification is awarded based on completion of a checklist of actions. Only staff who have attended the Leading for Environmental Sustainability Workshop are eligible to complete the checklist on behalf of their department. The checklist is accessible online to these staff members.  While some offices may have only a few staff members working closely on the checklist, all staff in the office should be familiarized with the checklist and personal actions they can take that contribute to office sustainability.  For this reason, the certification is recommended for groups of 5 to 20 staff.  Of the 58 items on the checklist, 40 items must be completed to receive certification.

The Duke Green Classroom Certification is a voluntary program created to provide faculty with the opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of their courses and classrooms at Duke University while demonstrating eco-friendly behaviors to students.  Faculty are encouraged to engage peer faculty within their departments in the certification as well.  Green Teaching can constitute a number of different teaching strategies, including reduction of paper use or paperless teaching, reduction of energy use in the classroom, and reduction in use of classroom supplies other than paper. Faculty who achieve Duke's Green Classroom Certification take significant steps to green the delivery of their course. Examples of common practices implemented by faculty to reduce the environmental impact of their course include allowing electronic submission of assignments, providing online readings and turning off lights and electronics in the classroom when they are not in use. The eco-friendly aspects of course delivery may vary by faculty, by course, and throughout the semester. Certification must be obtained prior to the start date of the course.  Duke Green Classroom Certification is awarded based on the completion of 25 of the 35 items on a checklist.

As a registered Cleanologist, custodians are asked to advise other employees as the need arises.  Any and all members of the custodial team have the ability to become a registered Cleanologist, and thus the ability to serve as a peer mentor for new custodial employees.  ","Rice custodians undergo a formal training program known as Cleanology.  Cleanology is defined as the study of cleaning and behavior in relation to custodial maintenance.  The Facilities, Engineering & Planning department at Rice has compiled a formal document outlining the Cleanology procedures, training techniques and requirements.  The stated mission of the Cleanology program is to provide faculty, staff, students and visitors with a healthy, clean and safe environment.  Furthermore, the program seeks to promote green cleaning and a “green and clean” lifestyle through the use of environmentally friendly products, promote sustainability and life cycle for a healthier and safer environment, and combat pollution and global climate change.  
Specifically, the Cleanology program includes formal classroom training from both internal and external experts in the field, onsite seminars, and on-the-job training.  Throughout the program’s 16 training modules, custodial teams learn everything from chemical safety and green cleaning to the Cleanology procedure and conflict management.  
The Custodial staff has the ability to achieve the levels of basic, certified, and registered Cleanologist.  Basic Cleanology is an eight-hour course taught over eight weeks.  All custodial employees must attend and pass this course during their new-hire period.  A 10-month course is required for both the certified and registered levels.  After receiving a registered status, participants are selected to attend the “Top Gun School” to learn the latest teaching methods and become instructors.  It is the overarching goal of the program to provide Cleanologists and managers with high technical proficiency and knowledge of the systems on campus.  Training sessions are offered periodically throughout the year so as to ensure that all current and replacement employees have the opportunity to attend. ","Eusebio Franco, the director of Custodial Services and the Grounds Department for Rice’s Facilities and Engineering Planning group, created the Cleanology program.  He supports the program, and ensures its success by meeting annually with each member of his staff, all 126 of them.

While Green Team members have the freedom to work on a variety of issues at any given time, each semester they are provided with an on-line toolkit to help implement a specific campaign.  One component of the toolkits is an audit survey, which once completed provides a baseline for Green Team members to measure sustainability initiatives against.  Concentrating our efforts on a single campaign not only increase the impact of our programming on campus, but it also helps us track the results of our work.

Topics for toolkits touch upon four specific priority areas within the realm of sustainability: energy conservation, materials reduction, transportation alternatives and social sustainability.  These topics have been identified as priorities for Green Team members based upon a number of factors including achievability.  Within each of the four priority areas, individual surveys and tools to help Green Team members implement specific sustainability initiatives in their office setting have been developed.

• inspire colleagues to make positive changes in energy, waste, food, purchasing and transportation and more;
• provide information about the ecological impact of daily workplace activities;
• identify more sustainable initiatives in their department;
• communicate UBC sustainability policies, procedures, news and events;
• make sustainability easy and fun.

The training sessions helps equip SCs with the relevant knowledge and skills to advance sustainable practices in their departments. SCs also have the opportunity to attend quarterly lunch and learns to broaden their knowledge in sustainability related issues on and off campus. Additionally, every SC is also given an orientation to the program which includes a visit from the program coordinator and an online orientation guide to help new SCs better understand their role, the resources available to them through the program and to help them assess their department's current sustainability practices and goals. Finally, SCs have access to the SC Toolkits. For office SCs, this is a series of online tools in energy conservation, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, green event planning, sustainable purchasing, sustainable transportation choices and waste reduction. Tools for lab SCs include lab energy and water conservation, solid and hazardous waste management, aqueous waste and green purchasing. The tools provide SCs and their co-workers with step-by-step actions on how to implement sustainable solutions in their departments.

They are required to have a Green Team of 2-3 individuals who are the sustainability the champions for their office and liaisons between the office and the Green Office Certification program staff during the assessment and training process.,"Step 1: Create a Green Team

What is a Green Team? 

The main role of the Green Team is to be the champions for their office and to be liaisons between the office and the GOC staff. The GOC Green Team is a key component in the green office certification process. Here are their roles: 

Two members is the minimum but we encourage four
Green Team members will need to assist GOC staff in scheduling meetings (2) and communicating with Building Managers/Office Manager/Department Head regarding waste assessments, building information, etc.
Students are allowed to be a part of the Green Team but limit to one per office and the impetus to participate in the green office certification program must be driven by staff.
Step 2: Conduct Office Asssessments

The Office Assessment Involves Three Components:

Sustainability Office Assessment (Observational and verbal components)

Waste Assessment

Step 3: Assessment Results Presentation 

With guidance from the Green Team, coordinate an office meeting during which a representative from the GOC will report the office’s assessment results. Then a GOC member/s will facilitate a brainstorming session during which the members of your office (with the help of the representative) will put together your Office Sustainability Commitment and Plan based on the results of your Office Assessment. Action items and goals will be set forth with tentative completion dates. The office will get its green office certificate as well as any items that can help the office operate more sustainably.

Step 4: Implement your Office Sustainability Commitment and Plan

Implement your plan. Begin taking the steps your office brainstormed during the final meeting. A representative from GOC will compile all of the action items produced from the workshop and send you a link to the formal online version of your office's Office Sustainability Commitment and Plan. Both your office and the GOC team will have access to this document. Treat it like a checklist, and indicate which action items that your office completes. Of course, representatives from GOC will always be available at any time to answer questions or help address issues regarding the implementation. 

Step 5: Continue to work hard in incorporating sustainability in your everyday practices!

We will continue to work with your office to incorporate sustainable practices in your daily practices. We re-certify offices after a 3 month check-in so continue working hard! We also offer trainings on specific topics that you'd like to learn more about in order to implement your commitment plan, upon request.",Sustainability Office Program Manager oversees team of students to conduct trainings and assessments.

Labs that express interest in certification are contacted through their prime investigator and lab sustainability representative to begin certification and assessment process.","- Participating labs are placed through a 3 phase process to complete our goal.
Phase 1: Self-Assessment 
Labs must complete a lab self-assessment created by mygreenlabs, an off campus nonprofit organization. The self-assessment is an online survey that asks labs to reflect and review their current sustainable lab practices and environment. By completing the self-assessment, it will allow the Green Labs team to gain more insight on the lab and understand trending sustainable obstacles our campus faces.


Phase 2: Walk-through Evaluation
Once a self-assessment is completed, the Green Labs team will schedule a 30-40 minute walk-through of the interested labs to confirm the data received in the self-assessment and to view the current lab sustainability situation in regards to behavior, equipment, and safety. These aspects of the lab correspond to a graded checklist which the Green Lab team will fill out to later determine the certification status of the lab. By performing the walk-through the Green Labs program is able to cater its resources to better support and improve the lab environment.

Phase 3: Follow Up Meeting
A separate meeting with the lab prime investigator/lab sustainability representative and the Green Labs team is scheduled to review the graded checklist and present the lab's certification status. From there the Green Labs will recommend resources and accommodations that they feel would better support the lab's sustainability practices and environment
","The Green Labs Program is overseen by the Climate Action Manager and overall supported through the UC Santa Cruz Sustainability Office. Addition assets for the program's resources are offered by the Carbon Fund Program who offer support for on campus sustainability projects.

The duties of the Eco-Leader include:

Attend one one-hour orientation training session,

Utilize and maintain an Eco-Leader Manual of resources and guides for office environmental practices. The manual is provided by the Environmental Center.

Receive a monthly e-newsletter and disseminate relevant information to their departmental colleagues.

Conduct a self-assessment of office practices. 

If a department chooses to pursue Green Office Certification, the Eco-Leader will facilitate this process by scheduling the training programs for their department. It is suggested that these programs be incorporated into existing departmental meetings in order to increase participation. The trainings are conducted by Environmental Center staff. Eco-Leaders receive a Reference Manual.  ","This program is funded as part of the Environmental Center's Operations Budget,.  One student staff coordinator position at the EC is budgeted at $3K/yr.

The series is not intended to be exhaustive concerning sustainability as a whole, nor any individual topic, but the intent is to empower and educate our students, staff, and faculty about the different ways UofL is addressing sustainability and what the UofL community must do in order to help move forward.

There are two tiers of training for Eco-Reps at the University of Louisville - both a Basic and an Advanced program. The Basic training includes a series of videos and accompanying supplementary materials available online. Participants are encouraged to register for the written examination for Eco-Reps Basic certification. Certified Eco-Reps then educate peers at UofL, lead workshops, and offer their expertise to community projects both on and off campus. 

Those interested in going deeper can also become certified in Advanced Sustainability Topics through the Eco-Reps Advanced certification program. The Advanced program offers serious sustainability advocates the opportunity to work with a UofL mentor in a particular sustainability area to develop a focused project that addresses the needs of the university or wider community. The Advanced program begins with video training about a particular topic, such as bicycling for transportation, making solar panels, or vermiculture. You’ll then explore a set of supplemental materials on the topic and develop a proposal for a community project. Proposals will be reviewed by the Sustainability Council and the Eco-Reps mentor.
