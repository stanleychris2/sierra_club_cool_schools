SolarCity owns the installations which they designed, constructed, and maintain; and Bowdoin purchases all the power produced by the system at a fixed rate. More than six times the size of the next largest existing solar installation in Maine at the time of construction, this system provides approximately 8 percent of the College’s electricity. 

The installation is one of several efforts to support renewable energy production on campus. It also provides meaningful educational opportunities for students and faculty focused on alternative energy.  In addition to providing faculty members access to raw production and usage data for their coursework, the College has provided numerous educational tours of the solar systems and has made live electricity production meters for each location publicly available on Bowdoin’s sustainability website.

In 2015, five portable solar light poles arrived on campus, the poles are currently being used in our newest, unfinished north parking lot.  When this parking lot is finished with permanent lighting, the solar poles can be partially dismantled and relocated to a new area in need of a light source. This lighting does not need a permanent connection to electricity and is a renewable energy source from solar radiation from the sun. Here, in Southern California, solar energy is virtually unlimited daily no matter the season, so the utilization of more and more solar energy is a goal CI is striving for. These five light poles are a start to a new generation of energy efficient, renewable, and portable lighting for safety and function on campus. ","Before the use of the solar light poles, a diesel generator was used to provide lighting for safety in the ""overflow"" parking lot that is located in a relatively remote and naturally dark area of campus. The diesel generator was loud, smelly, and inefficient. Now that the solar poles light this area, safety is not a concern because the area is adequately lit year-round without the noise and exhaust smells.

The CSUN food garden was established to educate students about sustainable food gardening techniques and healthy food choices, to promote direct community involvement and provide service-learning opportunities. A food garden working group was started in July 2009. The group met with campus leaders and students to develop the CSUN food garden. The garden is currently managed by Dr. Mario Giraldo. A student assistant helps to maintain the garden with dedicated volunteer students. With over 400 square feet of raised beds, more than a dozen fruit trees, and low-water irrigation, all built and planted by student, faculty, and staff volunteers the garden has grown tremendously and continues to thrive. 

About the Compost Program

The CSUN compost program was established to reduce campus food waste and to educate students on how food waste can be turned into compost, which can then be used to grow new food. Composting began on a small scale alongside the Food Garden using green waste and small containers. In 2013 the compost program was relocated to its current. The compost facility began with seven compost boxes that were built using recycled pallets, and has grown to include 17 compost beds. The program consists of food waste pick-ups that are done three times a week to various food locations on campus. The waste is then transported to the compost facility to be sorted and put in a compost bed until ready to be used in the food garden.","2013: Goal 2.8 tons/ 8 tons actual pre consumer waste diverted

It encourages innovation and teamwork among administration, faculty and student populations from multiple educational disciplines, representing various campus interests, by promoting, supporting, and housing ongoing sustainable technology research projects within a common functional space.

Because numerous research projects coexist within the same functional footprint, knowledge of various technologies is easily acquired and transferred.  Those working on STORC-related research projects quickly recognize how dissimilar technologies might be configured to contribute to the enhanced performance of other technologies.  As a practical living laboratory and a multi-disciplinary center for learning, STORC synergistically enhances research outcomes and student learning experiences.

Interdisciplinary participation in STORC includes professors and students from Natural Science and Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science, Social Science and Interdisciplinary Studies, and from various administrative offices such as Environmental Health and Safety, Risk Management, and Facilities Management.

STORC is an example of Sac State’s ingenuity in furthering research and education, and is redefining traditional models of knowledge acquisition and transfer, and exemplifies every aspect of high-quality leadership that Sacramento State strives to instill in its faculty, staff and students.

Vision:

To be an international resource for practical, scalable, and financially viable solutions in the area of sustainable technologies that are suitable for private and/or public sector operations related to the management of energy, food, water and waste.","At present, more than five sustainable projects are in various stages of operation at STORC. Sustainable projects in operation, in various stages of construction, or under consideration include:
•	Wind Aerators: Wind aerators can be used to oxygenate agricultural ponds. These can be constructed using a variety of techniques. Items needed to build such systems are plentiful (e.g., waste drums, small vehicle axles, diaphragm pumps, etc.). As simple as this seems, the big challenge is in creating a system that actually addresses real-world O2 demands in agriculture and aquaculture operations.
•	Solar Space Heaters: Building solar space heaters for homes/out-buildings, using air and/or water and passive heat transfer techniques is an idea gaining momentum with DIYers. Old car radiators can be used for heat transfer once the water has been sufficiently heated by the sun. Also, old, tempered glass such as shower doors, are easily obtainable, and can be used to trap and amplify solar energy.
•	Hydroponic Gardening Systems: This is a very fascinating concept, and an amazingly efficient crop production concept when combined with aquaculture and photo-electric systems.
•	Water Filtering Systems: A properly designed, passive system using 55 gallon drums can filter contaminated water very efficiently and inexpensively.
•	Electric Power Generation Systems: Constructing small solar arrays for running well and pond pumps on remote properties.
•	Electricity Producing Wind Turbines: Vertical axis or traditional propeller driven wind turbines can be constructed using materials that are readily available for little or no cost.

Chatham University's Falk School of Sustainability (Falk School) has designed one-year Master of Sustainability (MSUS) and Master of Arts in Food Studies (MAFS) programs exclusively for EARTH University graduates. Chatham and EARTH University share foundational principles: ethical values, entrepreneurialism, and a commitment to addressing environmental, social, and economic issues. EARTH doesn’t offer a Master’s degree, but the intensity of their undergraduate program – 200 credits instead of the 120 common in the U.S. – means that EARTH students finish with the equivalent of a year of graduate education under their belts. 

During the first two weeks of August 2015, Chatham offered undergraduate and graduate students from the Falk School of Sustainability a two-week field experience course, FST 602: Global Agriculture, at EARTH University taught by Professors Nadine Lehrer and John Taylor. The following list is the outline of the course learning objectives:
-Address both historically-specific and globally socio-political questions surrounding tropical agriculture, ecosystem services, sustainability, food production, and international development
-Examine the opportunities and challenges to sustainable development, environmental conservation, and agricultural production in Costa Rica
-Analyze the implications of and the relationships between the typically bifurcated agricultural system (commodity export production on one hand and smallholder subsistence oriented farming on the other) of much of Latin American and the global South more broadly
-Develop a comparative understanding of agricultural production in a tropical ecosystem","In Fall 2014, EARTH student Arely Quirós Alpízar came to the Falk School for an internship, working closely with Allen Matthews, Director of Sustainable Agriculture. Arely worked on the farms at Eden Hall, showing colleagues how to trap microbes that digest biodegradable

It is designed to see if microfinance groups are an effective network for implementing agroforestry carbon sequestration. The involved MS thesis has begun a dialogue toward changing policies for acceptable carbon offsets for higher education. 
Partnering with the Mbarara University of Science and Technology in southwestern Uganda, the Clarkson School of Business is working on a long term microfinance study. Embedded within that study the Institute for a Sustainable Environment has initiated a carbon sequestration scheme where women in the microfinance groups are given training and an economic incentive to practice agroforestry. Student interns and researchers from Clarkson and MUST are responsible for collecting data on the project. 

The concept of valuing this type of program for its educational value and potential for carbon off sets was the focus of Alex French's MS thesis.  The results of that work have grown into an AASHE and Second Nature dialogue about rules for claiming carbon offsets for GHG inventories.  These type of educational project have real value to students and carbon sequestration, yet rarely the budget for 3rd party verification.  Alex is participating in that on-going dialogue ad is using our own experiences and successes as part of the justification for looking somewhat more broadly at the role of student centered projects when we value carbon sequestration from non-verified projects.","This is an experimental structure for forest carbon being developed by the Clarkson University School of Business. Microfinance networks exist all over the developing world. This project is working to demonstrate how cost effective carbon sequestration can be by utilizing these existing financial networks to both mitigate climate change and encourage communities to adapt to climate change. This project is also unique in that it provides interesting educational and research opportunities for our institution. 
Some of the quantifiable successs include:
•	Successfully established 3 tree nurseries
•	One of the nurseries is a group of Catholic students 
•	Roughly 1,000 trees and shrubs have survived over 21 farms
•	2 rainwater catchment systems have been installed
•	Farmers have expressed more interest moving forward and have requested specific species such as mango and grevillea (for timber)
•	4 Agroforestry trainings carried out
•	Land donated by Our Lady of Good Council nuns for agroforestry demonstration site
o	Significant amount of land
o	Fence has been built for initial planting area
o	Opportunity to restore a degraded mountain, experiment with new biodiesel industry, and offset (very possibly all of) Clarkson University emissions.

COA students have also supported the elementary school students in developing school compost programs and building school greenhouses. One field trip to a local farm and a harvest dinner in the fall also are included. 

A major purpose of this program, in addition to taste-testing locally and conventionally grown vegetables, is to develop student awareness of choices in our food system and how those choices impact the amount of fuel we burn (e.g., food miles) and therefore the carbon footprint of conventional food systems vs. local and organic food systems. Other topics include soil science and composting, Maine agriculture, animal care, cooking, and food preservation.

Denison University,2016-02-15,2016-02-15 15:55:28,kingje@denison.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Big Red Buyers Club - Wholesale Dining,"In an effort to further support local producers and to connect Denison faculty, students, and staff with high quality, local and responsibly sourced foods the Big Red Buyers Club was created.  Utilizing the connections and buying power of Bon Appétit, Denison’s dining service provider, gives the Denison community access to the same local coffee, cheese, yogurt, milk, beans, whole grains and cereal, salsa, syrups, pasta, flour, chocolate, candy, and gluten-free snacks that are served in the dining halls.  By focusing on year round staple items, the Buyers Club complements the local produce already available at biweekly farmers’ markets without competing with them.


The inspiration for the buyer’s club was threefold: 1) add more support to Denison’s Farm to Fork partners, 2) make it easier for members to be conscientious consumers, and even 3) help shape and support better eating and buying habits on the Denison campus. College is often the first time students cook for themselves in any significant way, and by providing them with convenient, affordable access to foods that happened to be healthy, local, and sustainable, the Bon Appétit team hoped to set them on the path to lifelong conscientious eating.


The Club was started as part of an Environmental Studies senior project initiated by Jen Curry ’15 and Emily Marguerite ’15.  They worked with S.K. Piper, Bon Appétit’s Sustainability Manager at Denison to launch the club. Anyone at Denison can create an online account on the university’s CaterTrax site, and once they pay the membership fee, they receive access to the buyer’s club menu. They can order and pay online, then pick up their order biweekly at the Slayter Student Union on campus. 

In addition to these efforts, Bon Appetit/Denison Dining is getting a wholesale license to allow it more flexibility to source local products.  One of the challenges to local and responsible sourcing of foods is overcoming additional costs of products without passing those on to students who are already feeling the financial pressures of college affordability.  Bon Appetit has secured a wholesale license that will allow it to sell some f the food stuffs it obtains from local sources to other local restaurants and entities.  This is beneficial in two important ways.  First, it allows Bon Appetit to maintain positive and productive relationships with producers even when the college is not in session.  These producers do not have to deal with seasonal fluctuations of our need - when we are not in session we sell those products to other local restaurants so they can increase their local food offerings and they get the added benefit of utilizing Bon Appetit's discounted volume pricing.

The second big benefit is that it allows us to switch to things like local chicken which is more expensive, except if we are able to buy the whole bird.  We don't necessarily need the whole bird, so we take the cuts we need and then can sell things like bones - to make stock; and wings to local restaurants.  In the end, it allows us to break even on the cost difference between local and traditional sourcing.","This program effectively increases the local and responsible food spend associated with the college.  

The program allows more local businesses to source from local farms and that further supports our regional food system while also building strong positive relationships with vendors and producers.

We can also measure and track the number of students, faculty, and staff that are regularly utilizing local food options.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/64/6/582/3264/STARS%20Innovation%20Dining%20Support%20Letter.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.bamco.com/blog/denison-university-shares-farm-fork-products-big-red-buyers-club/,True,True,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--

LOCALTUNITY- We Buy: You Eat was quickly absorbed by the Dickinson culture and is growing rapidly. This local/community opportunity allows groups of three or more Dickinson employees and/or students to visit and shop at our community Farmers on the Square (FOTS) Market (Carlisle, PA) for fresh foods grown by local farmers. 

With Dickinson funding, LOCALTUNITY participants receive one $5 wooden token per person to use at the market. Groups of Dickinsonians can double the fun of LOCALTUNITY by additionally agreeing to cook a meal together with their Farmers on the Square purchases. Groups that agree to cook together and send a photo to sustainability@dickinson.edu or use #dsonlocaltunity will receive $10 each to the market.

The innovative program is a win-win for Dickinson sponsors and the Farmers on the Square Market. More Dickinsonians are attending the market (within walking distance of campus), supporting the local economy, eating healthy, local foods, cooking meals together, and spending time together building community between faculty, staff, and students.

The program was quickly supported by campus co-sponsors that include: The Center for Sustainability Education, Department of Human Resources, Office of Student Development, Wellness Center, and Farmers on the Square.
","LOCALTUNITY was received with great success amongst students, faculty, and staff at Dickinson with over 500 unique Dickinsonians participating in the program. Over 100 groups of three or more went to the market together and over 75 groups prepared and ate a meal together after their Farmers on the Square Market adventure.

The program had a direct $5,000 financial impact on the Farmers on the Square Market, with unmeasurable financial impacts beyond that. Vendors noted that LOCALTUNITY participants spent much more than $5-$10 tokens they were given.

The success was so rapid and productive that we are currently in conversation with the market's board of directors and community leaders from other organizations and employers to replicate the LOCALTUNITY model throughout the Greater Carlisle area.

This program, developed by the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative (DCOI) and its partners, helps reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the local community while also providing significant environmental, economic, and social co-benefits.  The DCOI brought together students, staff, and faculty to design, develop, and implement the program over the course of academic year 14-15.  The program provides employees with information on rooftop solar and access to the local Solarize campaign discounts.  Nearly 300 Duke employees received information about solar and/or free solar assessments and 29 employees installed a total of 152 kilowatts of solar on their roofs before the expiration of the North Carolina state tax credit on December 31, 2015.

The overarching goal of the project was to leverage Duke University’s role as an employer to remove barriers to installing rooftop solar.  These barriers included up-front cost, lack of information (including suitability of a home for rooftop solar and contractor selection), and lack of motivation to shift from the status quo of purchasing electricity from the local utility.  By creating a program that addresses these barriers, the team aimed to make it easy for employees to install solar if it fit their needs.  In turn, each solar installation reduces GHG emissions in the region and provides co-benefits such as supporting the local economy and helping lock in electricity prices for employees.  Finally, this program was designed to build upon and complement the DCOI’s employee energy efficiency pilot program that helped employees save energy in their homes by educating employees on which energy efficiency retrofits to prioritize for their homes.","This interdisciplinary project was the product of three Duke undergraduate students, two graduate students, four faculty members, and two staff members from different corners of campus. See article from the Nicholas Institute: https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/articles/program-simplifies-lowers-cost-solar-installation

Solarize Duke was a part of a regional Solarize program. Solarize Duke led to 50% of solar contracted for the entire program (152 kilowatts out of 302 kilowatts).

The group hosted four information sessions that were attended by greater than 100 Duke employees.

The hydroponic greenhouse with outdoor tidal wetland facility can process up to 400,000 gallons per day and save the University over 100 million gallons of potable water annually – over 30% of our water footprint – as well as millions of dollars in utility costs over the term of the 20-year contract. The natural, ecological treatment process uses a variety of microscopic organisms to remove the wastes, and very few chemicals are required. The facility also reduces stress on the county’s existing, aged wastewater infrastructure and reduces the energy footprint needed to move wastewater to the current, far-away treatment plant.

Endicott College,2016-03-01,2016-03-01 10:09:56,screight@endicott.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Community Meetings,"Endicott has a number of regular events that bring together all full and part-time employees of the College in order to be updated, give input, or celebrate in each other’s company.  These include: 
•	Start of Year Orientation:   At the end of August all employees gather for several hours to kick off the school year, hear updates, meet new employees, and gather for lunch.
•	All Campus January Meeting:  In January all employees gather for the morning to hear updates.  In addition, this meeting generally has some small group discussions on a relevant topic.  For example, in January 2015 all College employees discuss student retention.  The meeting is followed by lunch. 
•	Community Day:  In the week after commencement, all employees participate in Community Day during which a variety of activities are offered.  These include activities such as a golf tournament, fishing, paddle boarding, bike riding, and sitting on the local beach.  Employees then gather for lunch. 
•	Community Meetings:   All staff meetings are held monthly for 1 hour to provide updates on current issues and events. 
These monthly community meetings and semi-annual community days are innovative ways to bring the college community together. Through these gatherings members of the community are able to interact with each other to discuss events, programs and happenings put on by the college. These meetings place emphasis on interdepartmental collaboration and strive to create cohesion within the Endicott community.

Furman University,2016-02-22,2016-02-22 13:42:57,yancey.fouche@furman.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Designation of campus as an accredited arboretum,"Furman University has received accreditation as a Level I arboretum through The Morton Register of Arboreta. Furman earned the recognition for exemplifying tree conservation, species diversity, and educational resources and events focused on landscapes and trees.

The George G. Willis Jr. Arboretum, whose grounds and tree tags are accessible to the public on the Furman campus, strives to be a model for other arboreta in the Southeast and across the nation. The predominance of native species makes the arboretum representative of arboriculture in Upstate South Carolina, and provides learning and research opportunities related to the region.

A Furman Trees Committee comprised of students, faculty, grounds staff, and community partners, developed an extensive arboretum management plan to monitor and maintain tree health and safety, and increase species diversity with a focus on local species.

The arboretum is named for George G. Willis Jr., a 1948 graduate whose passion for the Furman landscape persists to fund future arboretum developments.","The George G. Willis Jr. Arboretum affords opportunities for engagement in both the natural and social sciences. Students and faculty are collaborating to research and promote the environmental and human services provided by trees.

George Washington University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 13:04:19,shannonross@gwu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Inter-University Climate Change Negotiation Simulation,"GW is now partnering with the student-run Inter-University Climate Change Negotiations (ICCN) to organize and oversee annual simulations of negotiations conducted during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Conference of the Parties. A special feature of these GW-coordinated simulations is the support and participation of the Washington embassy for the country hosting that year’s actual negotiations. These events provide students with practical experience in international policymaking, and they promote relationships with professional practitioners, relationships students can draw upon after they graduate. 
This innovative program grew out of the sixth annual ICCN simulation hosted by GW in October 2015. Connections among the diverse, interdisciplinary students and faculty of GW’s Sustainability Collaborative led to an internal partnership with GW Debate and Literary Society, which had already established a working relationship with the Washington Embassy of France, the country that would host the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Paris in December 2015. Contacted by a student, staff, and faculty team, the embassy quickly agreed to support the simulation. That support ultimately included a reception at the embassy, at which Ambassador Gerard Araud spoke, and the participation of embassy staff in in the plenary sessions that punctuated the day-long simulation on Saturday, October 10th, 2015. GW’s connections with governmental and non-governmental organizations also resulted in keynote addresses by Dr. Nathan Hultman, the Deputy Director for Energy & Climate Change at the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), and Elliot Diringer, the Executive Vice President of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES).
Impressed by the results of the embassy connection, the nearly 80 students from 10 different colleges and universities who participated in the October 2015 event agreed to make Washington, DC, the site for the larger, national simulation each year. With the help of faculty and staff from GW’s Elliott School of International Affairs, the Sustainability Collaborative, and a diverse student organizing committee, the ICCN will solicit and organize the support of the Washington embassy for the country hosting the conference of the parties that year. Conversations have already begun with the embassy of Morocco for 2016.

Green Mountain College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:55:13,ihrker@greenmtn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Spring Concert Late Night Local Eats,"The Spring Concert Late Night Local Eats was an innovative event designed to address and lower high risk alcohol and drug use after Green Mountain College’s annual spring concert event. Each April on the Saturday directly after Earth Day, Green Mountain College has traditionally held one or more music concerts. These concerts are larger in terms of attendance and budget compared to other events held at the Green Mountain College campus. In addition to current GMC students, alumni, students from other schools, and community members also attend this event.  This weekend historically also experiences a larger level of high-risk choices related to alcohol and illegal drug use as evidenced by incident reports filed with the college’s campus security. On the night of the 2014 spring concert,  a life-threatening injury experienced by one individual called into question whether the spring concert tradition should continue.    

The College Programming Board, a group of student volunteers responsible for organizing the Spring Concert held a series of conversations with faculty, students, and staff to identify whether to continue with the College tradition and ways to address the associated risks. A key idea was to offer an event or activity after the concert where attendees could have a social way to wind down and provide an activity other than going to continue the party without alcohol or illegal drugs. They also wanted to offer food so students who choose to use substances later that evening wouldn’t be partying on an empty stomach. 

The College Programming Board worked with their staff advisor, the director of Student Involvement, to recruit popular food vendors from the local farmer’s market including Ana’s Empanadas, Caroline’s Pies, Chaga Moon, Taste of Asia, and Mediterranean Mix. With their free concert ticket, each  student was provided with the equivalent of $5 worth of food tickets to “purchase” food from the vendors. The vendors were given a set amount of money from the College Programming Board for offering food after the concert in exchange for the meal tickets. Attendees could also buy additional food beyond the $5 if they wanted. Items were priced from $1-$3 so students could sample more than one item. 

","As the 2015 Spring Concert final band began its encore, attendees started to exit the concert venue and were greeted by the local food vendors and began sampling food. By the end of the show, the crowd filled the food vendor lobby space and the space was packed for the next hour. In addition, pies were also sent to the largest residence hall lobby for another location where residence staff could engage and check-in with people entering the building after the concert to offer a space to hang out and also monitor if anyone was in a dangerous or risky situation.  

No incidents or medical emergencies related to alcohol or illegal drug use were reported for the evening. Although the local eats event was not the only change made to address the safety of the event, in review of the Spring Concert, students and staff identified the food vendors after the show as a key factor in the event’s success. Specifically, students cited the variety of prepared foods offered from local producers featuring cuisines that aren’t regularly available on late evenings in the small town of Poultney as a unique and attractive draw.

Hampshire College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 09:57:40,bhooker@hampshire.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Catalyzing a Transformation in New England Food and Agriculture,"For over 30 years the Hampshire Farm Center has been the focus of academic courses for students across the Five Colleges and individual student research. The Farm Center offers a 6-week, 8-credit summer academic program in “Food, Farm, and Sustainability.” New academic programs related to food and agriculture at the other institutions include a Sustainable Food concentration at Smith College, a thematic minor in Food at Mount Holyoke College, a UMass major and certificate in Sustainable Food and Farming, a UMass certificate in Food Studies, and the new Five College Sustainability Studies certificate with a concentration in Food and Agriculture. In 2013, Amherst College began to operate a vegetable farm on campus. This growing interest in sustainable agriculture education highlights the significant opportunities for collaboration and transformation across the Five Colleges. 

Over the next four years, we plan to establish a Center for New England Food and Agriculture, which will not only enhance the current academic, co-curricular, and community outreach programs, but also serve as a conduit for the College’s 100% Local Food Challenge, among other initiatives. 

The Center for New England Food and Agriculture will be comprised of the following components:
1.	Sustainable Agriculture Apprenticeship Program. This 6-month program, initially offered to 2-3 candidates per year, will focus on Northeast Regional approaches to sustainable food systems. Upon completion of the program, participants will have a command of ecological agriculture best practices and be able to implement these fundamental skills at their own farms across the Northeast, some of whom we may be partnering with on the 100% Local Food Challenge. 
2.	Internship Program. Student internships will provide experience on local, national or international scales. Local internships will be placed at various farms Hampshire may partner with on the 100% Local Food Challenge, allowing the Center to take the lead in the coordination of agricultural internships and easing that burden off of the local farmers. Interns will also be placed with our community partners, including the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts, Community Involved in Sustaining Agriculture (CISA), and Nuestras Raíces.
3.	Collaborative Research Program. Encouraging collaboration in thematic areas, the program will provide grants for faculty research on topics like climate change and agriculture, cultural impacts of food and agricultural production, and food security and urban agriculture. Helen Scharber, professor of economics, will conduct summer research on the estimated economic and employment impacts of sourcing Hampshire's food locally, building upon her current work with CISA. Jason Tor, professor of microbiology, plans to conduct summer research on the microbiology of cheese aging throughout the region to identify aspects of New England terroir, and how it can contribute to the 100% Local Food Challenge.
4.	Cross-Institutional Initiatives. The Center will support a Five College central network, “The Real Food for the Five,” an initiative committed to procuring a significant portion of food from regional, organic or ecologically-based farms and vendors.  Hampshire is working with the other four colleges to explore the creation of a Five College Virtual Food Hub.  

POISED FOR CHANGE
If local food is the web that connects us together in the Pioneer Valley, then the proposed Center for New England Food and Agriculture will be the hub that radiates new partnerships and collaborations. Up until now, the connections with local farmers and growers and community organizations that support them have been fragmented and decentralized. Creating the Center will provide a much needed opportunity to bring people together and explore the idea of what it means to source 100% of our food locally. Hampshire College is excited and ready to take the lead in catalyzing a transformation in food and agriculture in the Pioneer Valley and at our sister institutions of higher education.

Hampshire recently received grants totaling nearly $550,000 from the Lydia B. Stokes Foundation and the Henry P. Kendall Foundation to support collaborative research programs, sustainable agriculture apprenticeships, internships, and cross-institutional initiatives that will also advance Hampshire College’s goal of sourcing nearly 100 percent of food locally. 

Hampshire recently received a National Science Foundation, Advanced Technology Education (NSF-ATE) grant— “Application of Clean Energy Technology to Sustainable Agriculture Practice.” In collaboration with Holyoke Community College and University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Hampshire College received a 3-year grant of $135K (of total $810,000), which includes support for:
•	Clean energy technology for farm operations (electric tractor, greenhouses with heat pumps, retrofitting of root cellar with temperature and humidity control).
•	Summer course offered through HCC, with 2 weeks also at UMass Amherst and Hampshire College—faculty involved:  Steve Roof, Donna Cohen, and Fred Wirth.

The Washington Center’s New York Life Higher Education Civic Engagement Award. Hampshire College was one of five colleges recognized by The Washington Center for achieving breadth and depth of civic engagement through sustained and mutually transformational partnerships that define and address issues of public concern at any level from the local to the global. The Healthy Food Transition project of the Sustainability Initiative, including the creation of a Center for New England Food and Agriculture, was chosen specifically for the award and the College was presented with the opportunity for five student internships at $5,000 each, totaling $20,000.

STAFF AND FACULTY LIFE

Food Transition
Every staff and faculty member throughout the 2013-2014 academic year received one meal per week, funded by the Hirshberg grant.   This pilot program fostered a sense of community across the entire campus.  Many reported that the program allowed them to create new relationships and collaborations, in a relaxed setting.  Others commented positively on the new dining service, Bon Appetit, and on the modest dining commons renovation.  Students were particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity to eat and socialize with staff and faculty members.  

For the 2014-2015 academic year, we offered this program again, with an aim to encourage all campus members to view the dining commons as a vibrant, welcoming community space. 

","There are many components that must be researched in order for Hampshire College and our partners to assess the situation and plan for a collaborative implementation of the 100% Local Food Challenge through the Center for New England Food and Agriculture. We anticipate the most critical research components will be identifying farms (through CISA and local farmer relationships), and the transport, storage, and distribution of food (at Hampshire College, across the Five College Consortium, and our community partners like the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts). The Food, Farm and Sustainability coordinator will work with Bon Appétit and our community partners closely to research opportunities to improve regional agricultural infrastructure and understand systems and structures needed to advance more local products and markets. The Center staff will also produce a food blog that will detail the planning process and accomplishments over the grant period, providing transparency and accessibility to our community partners.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/713/6/582/3264/JLash%20ltr%20for%20AASHE%20application2015-1.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,https://www.hampshire.edu/sustainable/a-healthy-food-transition,True,True,True,True,--,--,--,True,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,"http://sites.hampshire.edu/ffs/

Harvard University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 16:58:53,colin_durrant@harvard.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Chemical Free Flame Retardant Pledge,"In November 2015, Harvard became the first university to sign a national pledge stating a preference for purchasing chemical flame retardant-free furniture. Other signatories to the pledge include Kaiser Permanente, Facebook, Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts, and Autodesk.

See the following blog post for more on the announcement: http://www.ceh.org/news-events/blog/choosing-a-chemical-flame-retardant-free-campus/

The Office for Sustainability is partnering with Harvard capital project and planning teams, Strategic Procurement, and Environmental Health and Safety to identify and source chemical flame retardant-free furniture across the University, and in accordance with regulations.

Our University-wide Green Building Standards were updated in 2014 to include healthy material requirements for the disclosure of health and environmental impacts of products that are used on campus in order to help us assess opportunities to understand the community’s exposure to potential toxins.

Harvard is also partnering with groups such as the Silent Spring Institute, the Center for Environmental Health, and the Green Science Policy Institute to not only understand links between health and exposure to certain chemicals, but to identify and prioritize areas of concern.

In 2014, in collaboration with Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Center for Health and the Global Environment researchers and the Silent Spring Institute founded the Healthy Green Campus project to better understand the prevalence of harmful chemicals on campus and to make health an integral part of sustainability practices on college campuses.

BACKGROUND ON CHEMICAL FLAME RETARDANTS

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency there are over 80,000 chemicals in use today, most are unregulated, and only some have undergone sufficient health testing. At Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and other Harvard Schools, including engineering and design, our researchers are working to better understand how exposure to harmful chemicals can impact human health and the environment. And through the University’s holistic Sustainability Plan and Green Building Standards, Harvard is identifying and tracking chemicals of concern in our built environment.

When public health scientists conduct their research, they think about sources (where pollutants come from and how they migrate into our environments), exposure pathways (determining how chemicals enter our bodies), and adverse health effects (how those exposures impact human health). And on flame retardant chemicals this entire pathway has been worked out thanks to research at Harvard and countless other universities, government agencies and non-profit institutions. The science is clear: halogenated and organophosphorous flame retardants have been widely used in upholstered furniture and other products for several decades; these chemical flame retardants migrate out of products and enter the air and dust in our indoor and outdoor environments, causing near ubiquitous exposure; and exposure to these chemicals is associated with adverse health effects including cancer, interference with the hormone system, impairments to neurological development, and reproductive harm.

Eliminating the use of these chemicals does not weaken fire safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission found these harmful chemicals do not provide a “practically significant greater level” of safety than untreated furniture. And furniture containing some flame retardants actually emits higher levels of carbon monoxide, soot and smoke than untreated furniture. New fire safety standards that improve safety while allowing manufacturers to eliminate the use of toxic chemicals in upholstered furniture allows Harvard, and other organizations, to make good purchasing decisions aligned with what the science tells us is necessary for public health.","1. Harvard’s preferred furniture vendors and manufacturers were surveyed in March 2015 on the use of flame retardant chemicals in their products.
2. A Health Furniture Toolkit and Buyer's Guide was created for all purchasers at Harvard: http://green.harvard.edu/sites/green.harvard.edu/files/Chemical%20Flame%20Retardant-Free%20Toolkit%20and%20Buyer%E2%80%99s%20Guide.pdf

Hobart and William Smith Colleges,2016-03-18,2016-03-18 08:33:38,sustainability@hws.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Pulteney Play Park,"The Pulteney Play Park is a unique public engagement collaboration between various offices, departments, classes, and other entities at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and a local apartment neighborhood, Geneva Gardens. With the support of HWS administration, faculty, staff, and students have worked together with residents of Geneva Gardens to imagine, design and create a successful, sustainable play space and garden.

Before launching the project, Geneva Gardens had been seeking a safe and creative outdoor space for its approximately 55 youth residents, who previously were limited to playing alongside streets and throughout a parking lot. The apartments are located in an area of Geneva that does not have immediate access to healthy, affordable food.

The sustainable play space project is innovative, in part, because it has leveraged curricular, co-curricular, service-learning, and other aspects of an HWS education for public engagement. In an anthropology and sociology seminar, students completed a feasibility study for the Play Park, interviewing and soliciting input from the Geneva Garden residents, managers and nearby neighbors. A second curricular piece of the project to date has been completed by the HWS Department of Art and Architecture. Students taking a class on sculptures built and installed – with the help of the HWS Center for Community Engagement and Service-Learning (CCESL) volunteers – a wooden bridge that spans across a small stream in the Play Park. CCESL has continued support of the Play Park throughout its development by recruiting volunteers and including the project in community-service opportunities through their office. Additionally, in the fall 2015 semester, several faculty members incorporated the Play Park into the project portion of their course. Faculty leaders on the project are Assistant Professor of Art and Architecture Gabriella D’Angelo, Professor of Art and Architecture Ted Aub and Professor Emeritus of Economics Christopher Gunn.

Other innovations include:
•	The park does not contain traditional manufactured components of a “playground,” but rather uses natural elements to create natural spaces for children to have fun. The park is designed to emphasize creation of play objects sourced from clearing existing dead and damaged trees on the site to create a “natural play space” in which children can experience an outdoor environment while getting exercise. Its attractions include logs and stumps on which to climb, a path or trail through the park for children and adults to walk, and a series of logs set in a circle for a community meeting place. 
•	An area with raised garden beds has been included to help address Geneva Garden residents’ limited access to healthy, affordable food and to provide a means by which to educate Geneva Garden residents about gardening and healthy eating. The community garden is being created through a democratic, community decision-making model. The chair of the Growing Geneva Together Community Garden Project is a member of the Play Park planning committee
•	HWS owns the property where the Play Park is located. HWS has agreed to lease the land to Geneva Gardens for $1 per year. Geneva Gardens has agreed to extend its liability insurance to cover users of the Play Park 
•	Both HWS and Geneva Gardens have agreed to be jointly responsible for the maintenance and policing of the play park.

The Play Park space continues to evolve with the implementation of new creative ideas, but children already have a safe place to explore the natural world in an urban area, as well as learn more about how to grow and eat healthy food.",,**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/495/6/582/3264/PulteneyPlayPark_LA_NA.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,True,True,--,--

Our courses explore the ecological, historical, social, political, and economic contexts of global environmental problems. Our courses
prepare students to become environmental leaders in their field of study through multi-disciplinary lectures, labs and field trips, readings
and discussion, and group projects.
The STEP courses are designed to move from topic to topic based on student input. Since fall of 2007, The Institute of Environmental
Sustainability has offered three iterations of the STEP course: Biodiesel, Food Systems and Water.
STEP: Food Systems
A significant portion of IES's STEP Food Systems course focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of small group projects.
These student-led projects are hands-on and offer real-world experiences that contribute to the course's overall goal of producing
workable solutions to problems in our food systems. During the semester students work with faculty mentors and/or community
organizations to develop their projects.
Multi-disciplinary Lectures:
• The origins of agriculture
• Plant breeding and genetic engineering
• Trends in human nutrition
• The U.S. Farm Bill
• Global social impacts of U.S. agricultural policy
• Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture
• Sustainable urban agriculture and local food distribution in Chicago
STEP: Biodiesel
This is an interdisciplinary course, taking an innovative, experimental approach to teaching. In order to get the project going and keep it
going, a wide range of knowledge is needed in business, biology, chemistry, environmental science, communication and politics. No
other class is able to offer such a comprehensive insight into one subject, making it a unique and powerful practice in teaching the
students.
Lectures provide an overview of their subject area as it applies to petroleum use and alternative energy, particularly biodiesel. The
students learn the whole process:
• How to convert leftover grease into fuel.
• Economic and environmental benefits and constraints of biodiesel.
• Politics involved in using alternative fuels.
• Business strategy to aid the implementation of the project.
• How to market the use of renewable fuel sources as a progressive step in higher education.
The lectures provide necessary background information for the students to further pursue the research of biodiesel.
STEP: Water
The STEP: Water course engages students with learning opportunities presented by a multidisciplinary group of faculty and
on-the-ground experts. Students will study current and historical, global and local issues regarding water conservation, and have theopportunity to initiate and lead campus projects pertaining to those issues. The course has the following attributes:
• Water sanitation
• Economics of water
• Freshwater ecology
• The Great Lakes resource
• Global, national and local water policy
• Water and the materials industry
• Public health and water-born infectious diseases
• Spiritual implications of water
• Historical significance of water (globally and locally)
• Water and agriculture
• Water and warfare
• Sustainable water use
• Social justice and water access issues
Course Strategy
Based on these considerations, the course employs the following major pedagogical strategies:
• Multi-disciplinary lectures offered by LUC Faculty from numerous departments and local experts and innovators
• Supporting texts provide context and discussion material for topics
• Discussions allow students to ask questions, to collectively explore ideas, to hear from their peers, and to elevate their understanding
• Lab activities allow students to develop practical and technical skills for solving environmental problems
• Field trips allow students to observe and communicate with practitioners in the field
• Students maintain a reflective journal throughout the course to synthesize their experiences and understanding
• Students work in small groups on semester-long service and/or research projects
• Groups work with faculty mentors and/or community organizations
• Students present project results at a STEP Public Forum
• Many of these projects become institutionalized","STEP’s CONTINUING PROJECTS:
Water: Student Projects & Areas of Investigation
• Aquaponics and sustainable fish farming
• A pilot living machine for waste nutrient removal
• Emerging contaminants in drinking water and aquatic ecosystems
• Irrigation and rainwater collection
• Water conservation policy on campus
Food Systems: Previous topics/projects:
• Developed the business plan that led to the launching of the Loyola Farmers Market in 2011
• Investigated best sustainable farming techniques and operations which were implemented on the Loyola Student Farm at Loyola's
Retreat and Ecology Campus
• Explored and identified the need for an apiary to be part of Loyola's educational food system programs
• Campus food production plan which resulted in the Urban Agriculture Demonstration Gardens Project that donates fresh, healthy food
to those in need
• Mobilized and coordinated students to create a new student group, the Growers Guild
• Created an edible landscaping plan and mapped existing and newly planted edible flora (cultivars and native)Biodiesel Lab
Hands-on experience comes while in the lab, where students learn the process of making biodiesel. From collecting the waste vegetable
oil from the university's cafeterias to titrating the free fatty acid content, students are expected to learn and experience how to physically
convert a waste product into a renewable fuel.
The Biodiesel Lab is primarily run by student fellows and students in our Biofuels Lab Course. These students oversee the production and
sale of:
• Biodiesel
• BioSoap
• Tiki Torch Fuel
• Biodiesel Processors",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/536/6/582/3264/LUC%20STEP%20Letter_1.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.luc.edu/sustainability/initiatives/step/index.shtml,True,True,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--

NREL's ReOPT program used load and performance models to select systems that optimized cost, but Miami was also interested in determining how far they could afford to reduce carbon emissions.  NREL and Miami worked to establish emission factors inclusive of ""upstream"" emissions, and to select a central value discount rate for the Social Cost of Carbon.  The ReOPT program was thereby able to select a system that not only optimized cost, but also minimized carbon emissions.  By subsequently ""subtracting out"" the SCC, the carbon optimized outcomes could be fairly compared to the outcomes that only reduced cost, without consideration of carbon.

Michigan State University,2016-02-16,2016-02-16 09:19:15,erhardt7@msu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Spartan Treasure Hunt,"The Spartan Treasure Hunt is a five to six hour event in which staff members from MSU Infrastructure Planning and Facilities (IPF) departments, subject matter experts and building occupants break up into teams, tour a campus building and identify opportunities to increase energy efficiency and other system improvements within the building. Through observation, measurement and inquiry, the teams produce a list of resource-saving opportunities.  

This innovative process, derived from General Electric (GE) and lean manufacturing, has been adapted to suit the needs of Michigan State University as an institute of higher education. The premise is to actually “go and see” if buildings and their respective systems are functioning and being utilized in the most efficient way. Buildings are dynamic entities: repairs are made to existing systems, new systems are installed, and space use may change dramatically from time of construction up to the current date. 

To start, MSU partnered with GE to do a treasure hunt in our Engineering Building. After learning how GE uses a treasure hunt to identify deficiencies within a plant, MSU took an innovative approach and applied the model to fit in with existing building commissioning and function within the many diverse buildings on campus. To date, Michigan State University has conducted Spartan Treasure Hunts in 22 campus buildings, and with the help of 233 different building occupants identified over 3,300 opportunities for resource savings.

By including building occupants on the treasure hunt, a symbiotic relationship is formed between them and the facilities staff that maintains the building. Occupants get to see “behind the scenes” and learn how their building works, and may learn strategies to utilize building systems more efficiently. Additionally, they receive one-on-one time with the staff who maintain their area and subject matter experts to help solve chronic issues.  The facilities staff also benefits from occupant involvement. By having a building representative on a treasure hunt team, IPF staff members receive historical background of the building that may or may not be recorded in the facilities database. Building representatives also provide context of how the space is used, which shapes and forms the recommendations to address the identified opportunity. How a space is used has major implications on building systems, energy use and opportunities to save energy.

Opportunities that are identified are then validated by the IPF commissioning team to calculate energy savings, feasibility and ROI.  These validated findings are then sorted into different funding streams, and are implemented in a strategic order.
","On the occupant side, we can measure engagement by the number of participants on teams during the hunt, individual building occupant follow-up survey responses , as well as the success of individual action plans within a building. Additionally, this event serves as a great mechanism to foster relationship building between facilities staff and the occupants of the building. The occupants also learn how their building functions and learns about building issues, satisfying the “why”.

This is a significant accomplishment in and of itself. The array covers about 10.5 acres of land and is the largest solar array on any liberal arts campus in the country. The array is owned by Spear Point Energy. An aspect of this project that is incredibly unique is the financing agreement and various stakeholders engaged in the project. Oberlin College wanted to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by producing solar energy, but it had no way to move the power from where it would be produced to where it could be used. Meanwhile, the city of Oberlin’s electrical utility (OMLPS), with a network of power lines and a power portfolio already heavy on renewables, was also looking to further shrink its carbon footprint. The two entities were already in contact because of shared goals, like the Oberlin Project and the Clinton Climate Initiative Climate Positive Development Program. The solar project was a great opportunity for the College and the City to work collaboratively towards mutually beneficial goals that get Oberlin closer to our carbon neutrality commitments. 

The two of them formed an unusual union, and spawned a mutually-beneficial offspring: a 2.27-megawatt solar array located on the college campus, and connected by the city utility’s distribution lines to the power grid.","• met about 12 percent of the college’s electricity needs

The programs seeks to engage students in food diversion in relation to the economic, social, environmental and health impacts that it has. The program also seeks to help students develop some basic skill around food portioning and food diversion. Students participating in the program are surveyed 
(convenience/snowball sampling) about knowledge and behaviors around food waste, both to open the discussion and assess the program. The program success is further measured by measuring the amount of student generated food scraps composted during the same lunch period (11am-1pm) the week prior to and after the week of the intervention each term. This allows us to determine the effect of the program/volunteer 
presence in the cafeteria and whether students change their behavior in response to us or intrinsically, long-term. 

Objectives: 

1. To engage students in food waste/portioning awareness educational programming as they pass through the cafeteria and dispose of their waste.

2. To asses student change in knowledge and behavior related to food waste/portioning by comparing pre and post participation survey results and food scrap weights.

3. To help inform catering services about potential opportunities for economic savings by encouraging student food waste reduction.

Process:

The No Scrap Left Behind cafeteria intervention was run once a week each term of the academic school year. The cafeteria (wall posters, service stations, tray return, napkin holders, etc) were re-signed for the intervention to promote and inform around food diversion. Volunteers tabled to discuss and interact with students about food waste and portioning. As students came through to the tray return area their food waste was collected and curated into a food waste buffet.

This program is especially innovative due to the comprehensiveness of the program and the robust data being collected regarding student behavior change on campus. For example, the students who are in the classroom creating the cafeteria campaigns are crafting components of their efforts over the course of an entire academic year for Freshman. These students are being administered the same survey twice, once before any word is made of either “food” or “waste” in the classroom and again 9 months later in their last collective classroom time. This survey was designed to gauge both the factual awareness of students regarding the food waste issue and its possible solutions. It also served to catalog students’ personal behaviors involving consumption and food waste. One of the big ideas driving NSLB is that in attempting to make change, we often change ourselves. ","Fall term data (intervention repeated in winter and spring):
92 surveys completed including important information on student's understanding and views around food waste.
1584 diners exposed to intervention through posters, info on napkin holders, seeing the food waste buffet, and possibly talking with staff or taking the survey.
Near 50% reduction in food scraps during presence of intervention staff.

Our goal is to measure: student engagement, potential for behavior change and waste reduction. Student engagement and potential for behavior change is  measured through voluntary surveys. Surveys include 

questions on general food waste knowledge, how the intervention impacted students and how they plan to change based on the new information/resources they have. 

Potential for behavior change is measured indirectly on surveys and directly through compost audits of student food waste, preformed back-of-house by PSU Ding staff, to quantify food waste before and after the intervention compared to the waste weighed during the intervention from the food waste buffet.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/73/6/582/3264/NSLB_Innovation_Letter.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.pdx.edu/sustainability/news/green-campus-spotlight-tackling-food-waste-one-lunch-time,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--

The MPS program will decrease printing costs, as well as, reduce the University’s impact on the environment for several reasons.  
First, once fully implemented, redundant photocopiers and printers will be removed with only energy efficient devices in operation.  This change will reduce the amount of energy needed to operate those devices, as well as, reduce the amount of energy vampires, machines that still use energy in stand-by or sleep-mode, on campus.  The printing devices that are removed are also diverted from the landfill.  Saint Louis University’s electronic waste recycler, MRC, is picking up all devices and safely disposing of the units or repurposing them. 
Second, the MPS program will centralize all printing processes and proactively order toner and ink, eliminating the stockpiling of consumables.  After the toner is empty, the cartridges are safely disposed using Xerox’s recycling program.
Finally, paper consumption will be reduced through actively promoting efficient use of paper.  The Blue Prints program has set the default settings to all printable devices to double-sided printing, which will result in reduced paper usage.  
Upon successful full implementation of the program, the University anticipates a reduction of its printing carbon footprint by up to 20% annually.  Not only will there be an environmental benefit, but savings will be realized through reduction of energy and printer leases estimated at $300,000 in savings.  Employees will also benefit from a wellness activity in getting up from their desks to gather their printing materials, creating physical activity and preventing sitting in one location for an extended period of time.","A reduction of SLU's printing carbon footprint by up to 20% annually and estimated savings of $300,000.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/307/6/582/3264/IN-1_1.pdf,True,True,**,True,http://www.slu.edu/x91298.xml,--,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--

Simon Fraser University,2016-02-08,2016-02-08 23:41:39,erica_lay@sfu.ca,2.0,Pursuing,SFU's Zero Waste Initiative,"In January 2014, SFU’s Sustainability Office, in partnership with Facilities Services, launched a new ‘Zero Waste’ initiative at SFU. Existing waste bins in public spaces were replaced with new, 4-stream Zero Waste Stations. Stations now sort disposables into four streams: food scraps and organics; mixed paper; recyclables; and landfill garbage. 

SFU’s Initiative aims to double the amount of waste recycled or composted by 2015, while diverting 70% of waste from landfills. This goal was adopted in the SFU Sustainability Strategic Plan 2013-2016, and mirrors Metro Vancouver’s target in both percentage and timeline, making the program part of a wider, regional goal to have one of the highest recycling rates worldwide.

Visual cues for each material stream are consistent with the streams, colours and signage adopted by Metro Vancouver. Organics recycling has been introduced well in advance of Metro Vancouver’s landfill ban, meaning that more materials can now be recycled at SFU, and we are pioneering standardized recycling stations across all three SFU campuses – making recycling at SFU consistent, convenient and easier. 

The program launch in January featured a fun music video on Zero Waste at SFU with a local musician; a new comprehensive Zero Waste website listing materials suitable for each bin, as well as the lifecycles for each stream; social media activity; on-campus zero waste events; and in-person orientations to the new system conducted by staff and volunteer student ‘Zero Waste Educators’.

Progress is being monitored through community feedback mechanisms such as surveys, on-site waste audits, and data from waste haulers. The results of these allow us continually to adapt the program to improve performance. For example, the signs at the stations will be were changed at the beginning of the Summer semester, in May, to reflect what we have learned. 

Since the launch of this Initiative, we have been contacted by several other universities in North America looking to incorporate aspects of our initiative (e.g., our signage and even our particular bins) into their programs. Our ultimate aims are to create a no-waste culture while making SFU a leader in waste management best practice; sharing our knowledge and experience with other institutions is an important start.

The Zero Waste program is about much more than just separating waste into different bins. We know that the best way to reduce waste is to reduce consumption of items that become waste. One timely example is to find and embrace alternatives to single-serving coffee machines, an activity we are currently working with SFU’s Procurement Office, the UniverCity Trust and student groups to implement. Also in development is a “green certification program” for food vendors to encourage them to move away from the use of Styrofoam and toward more sustainable food packaging, especially less packaging.
","In the five months since the launch of the Zero Waste Initiative, SFU has gone from a 29.8% diversion rate in November 2013 to a 47% diversion rate in May 2014.  Between January and May 2014, 198 tonnes of waste was diverted from the landfill, accounting for $19,273 savings in landfill disposal fees because of this diversion.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/217/6/582/3264/STARS%20Innovation%20Point%20Letter-Zero%20Waste.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.sfu.ca/sustainability/zerowaste.html,True,--,--,True,True,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--

Reid Bertone-Johnson, field station manager, worked with many Smith students during the project. The design incorporated composting toilets and solar panels that return to the grid greater than 50 percent more energy than the building uses.

Teams are judged on ten contests ranging from juried contests like Architecture and Engineering to measured contests like Comfort Zone and Energy Balance. Since 2002, the Decathlon has demonstrated to the public and the home-building industry that solar homes can be affordable, attractive, and comfortable to live in, while also providing a once-in-a-lifetime educational opportunity for young designers and engineers entering the workforce to gain hands-on experience in an interdisciplinary learning environment.

In November of 2011, a small group of Stanford students submitted the very first proposal for Stanford University to compete in the 2013 Solar Decathlon. In January of 2012, Team Stanford was selected as one of twenty teams, including four California teams, two Canadian teams, and two European teams, to officially compete. For its sixth iteration, the 2013 Decathlon moved from the National Mall in Washington D.C. to the Orange County Great Park in Irvine, CA. After two years of design, engineering, fundraising, and construction, Team Stanford delivered its competition entry, titled Start.Home, to the Great Park and competed from October 3rd-13th, finishing in fifth place overall. The Start.Home was then reassembled at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, to replace the ranger’s residence and eventually transition to housing for long-term visiting researchers and scholars.","The project team raised over $1.2 million in cash, in-kind, and service contributions and included over 125 undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students over the course of two years, along with participation by over twenty faculty and staff and thirty departments, programs, and university groups. In addition, the project team actively engaged in outreach opportunities and media exposure, leading to a community reach of over 23,400 individuals and over forty unique publications ranging from print and radio to online and nationally televised news coverage. The Start.Home team not only constructed one of the most affordable (1st place award) and marketable (3rd place award) homes in the competition with a unique vision for a Core module that resonated with a national audience, but it also created a legacy of building innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and project-based learning that will inspire future Stanford Solar Decathlon entries in years to come.

State University of New York at Cortland,2015-10-09,2015-10-09 13:15:52,Beth.Klein@cortland.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Solar Photovoltaic Development Project,"On May 9th, 2014, SUNY Cortland symbolically threw the switch on more than 3,600 solar panels, highlighting the College’s commitment to becoming one of the greenest campuses in the nation.

The $3 million solar project is the first of its kind in the 64-campus SUNY system and could serve as a blueprint for other public colleges in New York state. It will be used as a renewable energy laboratory for students and produce 1.5 million kilowatt hours of clean solar electricity — enough to power 130 homes.

“This will generate 6 percent of all our electricity in the future,” said SUNY Cortland President Erik J. Bitterbaum, who joined state Sen. James L. Seward and an aide to Assembly Member Barbara Lifton in pulling a ceremonial switch next to one of the sprawling panel arrays. “We are very excited about this.”

The panel project, built and owned by private renewable energy company SolarCity through a New York State grant, is just the most recent SUNY Cortland “first” in the area of energy and environmental sustainability. 

Bitterbaum was one of the original signatories of the American College and University President’s Climate Commitment and the College is the first, and only, SUNY institution welcomed into the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s Green Power Leadership Club. SUNY Cortland pioneered the creation of “Green Reps,” students hired to educate their peers about sustainability, and created a professional science master’s degree program in sustainable energy systems that is unique within SUNY.

Last year, the College became the first SUNY campus to fill all of its electrical needs with green energy, largely by committing to buy renewable energy credits. In March, SUNY Cortland’s newest residence hall became the first campus building in the SUNY system to achieve a platinum rating under the national Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system.

“I think the improvements and changes that are being made here on campus really do mirror the innovative thinking of those who are enrolled in classes here at SUNY Cortland,” said Seward, who recently attended the grand opening of the College’s state-of-the-art science building. “By becoming the very first SUNY campus to operate entirely on renewable electrical energy, it sets you apart as a trailblazing campus in all of the right ways.”

The College used an innovative approach toward building commercial-scale solar arrays on campus by taking advantage of a unique state initiative designed to increase the number of solar installations throughout New York. Last year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo named SUNY Cortland as one of 79 project sites for an award by NY-Sun, a solar energy program run by the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority.  

Through the program, SolarCity built three installations with a combined total of 3,604 photovoltaic panels on campus. The project spreads 2,244 panels across a grassy area near the old west campus entrance to SUNY Cortland off Route 281, and added 680 panels each to the roofs of the Park Center Alumni Arena and the new Student Life Center, currently under construction.

Under a 20-year power purchasing agreement with the College, SolarCity will continue to own and operate the panels and SUNY Cortland will buy the power they produce at a set rate that is likely to save about $200,000 over the life of the deal. Although the College had hoped to get to 10 percent solar power by 2050, the scale of the huge solar project has allowed the campus to pull about 6 percent of its electricity from the sun already.

“In light of the most recent report on climate change, the National Climate Assessment, that once again warns us of the dire effects of global warming and the fact that we have to act now and we have to act big, what is happening here at SUNY Cortland makes us all very, very proud of you,” said Linda Smith ’82, Lifton’s chief of staff and a SUNY Cortland graduate. “It’s just another example of SUNY Cortland uniquely training the next generation to go out into the world. It gives us hope that we can face the challenges of global warming.”

The College has already incorporated the new solar installations into the studies of its sustainable energy systems students, according to Brice Smith, chair of SUNY Cortland’s Physics Department.

“Residential-scale systems are important and they are going to continue to expand, but systems of this size have their own unique aspects,” Smith said. “To be able to have a living, working system like this on campus will be an enormous help to our students. It will let them learn and really go into the world with a level of experience that very few others will be able to match.”

The solar installations have not only caught the attention of students, alumni and community residents, but also impressed job candidates brought to campus to fill a new sustainable energy teaching position, Smith said.

“Every single one of our candidates who came and looked at our campus were just amazed at how much we have been able to do, how much we were already doing, and this system was a big part of that,” Smith said. “On campus now we have solar systems at both the residential-scale size on Dragon Hall and at the commercial scale here. We have solar thermal, we have geothermal; the entire campus now is one giant laboratory for renewable energy, and that’s a real remarkable change that has happened in a very short period of time thanks to some very important leadership on campus.”

One key leader behind the push toward sustainability was not able to attend the May 9 ceremony. William Shaut, the vice president of finance and management who presided over the decision to pursue the solar project, commit to 100 percent renewable electricity and SUNY Cortland’s other green initiatives, recently passed away after a long illness. Friday’s ceremony was dedicated to his memory.

“Those who knew Bill will attest to his commitment to sustainability and energy conservation,” said Nasrin Parvizi, associate vice president for facilities management. “He was a financial officer, so he liked energy savings. But that was not why he was such a great advocate: It was because he believed it was the right thing to do.”","Estimated annual energy savings (kWh) would be calculated based on the line loss efficiency of having the on-site electricity production.  The system operating on campus will have an approximate annual production is 1,284 MWh.  The local utility, National Grid, estimates a line loss power conversion factor of about 3.34.  This equals an approximate savings of 3,005 MWh of avoided losses due to off-site power generation.
This savings represents a huge boost to SUNY Cortland achieving a reduction in the Energy Use Intensity for the entire campus, part of Executive Order 88.  The system is a unique example of Public / Private Partnership to increase utility market transition for greater diversity and increased renewable energy produced within New York State.

Sterling College,2016-01-28,2016-01-28 10:04:12,cfeuerstein@sterlingcollege.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Bird-friendly sugarbush recognition,"The Virginia Russell Maple Sugarbush, abutting Sterling College’s campus and managed by its students and faculty, is home to over 200 maple taps and numerous species of birds. Both trees and birds will be able to coexist and thrive, thanks to the Bird-Friendly Maple Project, which just recognized the sugarbush as supporting both bird habitats and sugaring activity.

The Bird-Friendly Maple Project is a partnership among Audubon Vermont, the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation, and the Vermont Maple Sugar Maker’s Association. It seeks to promote bird conservation and maple syrup production.

More than 30 species of birds are known to use maple sugarbushes as nesting habitats, including the wood thrush, the scarlet tanager, and the black-throated blue warbler. Bird-friendly sugarbushes have features that allow birds to successfully raise the next generation, including a diversity of tree species, layers of vegetation, and a plan for invasive plant control.

Sterling College, in partnership with the Russell family, is one of only six maple producers recognized for managing its sugarbush in bird-friendly ways. It is the first college to be so recognized.

“At Sterling College, we are constantly assessing how we steward the land, as well as how the land fits into the broader landscape,” said Farley Brown, Faculty in Ecology. “That includes working with the Russell family to ensure the sugarbush is managed in a way that integrates both our syrup production and bird conservation. ”

She continued, “This is a great example of the connectivity between land management and an ecosystem management approach; a healthy sugarbush is also breeding habitat for Neotropical birds. The forests of Vermont are a globally important nesting habitat for many songbirds. As Vermont’s environmental stewardship college, we are so excited to demonstrate that syrup production and songbird habitats aren’t mutually exclusive.”

“At a time when the maple sugaring industry is rapidly expanding, Audubon Vermont is excited that Sterling College and the Russell family are participating in the Bird-Friendly Maple Project,” said SteveHagenbuch, conservation biologist with Audubon Vermont. “Not only is Sterling the first educational institution to get involved with the project, it is also critical to the long-term health and sustainability of the forest and all its wild inhabitants to think about managing the sugarbush as a natural ecosystem rather than a row crop.”

“By engaging Sterling students in this process, we are educating tomorrow’s maple producers about the importance of diverse structure and composition in the sugarbush,” he continued. “It’s a win-win-win solution for the students, the forest—including birds and other wildlife—and Vermont’s maple industry.”

Stevens Institute of Technology,2016-03-24,2016-03-24 15:20:54,gotham360@stevens.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Low-Flow Liquid Desiccant Air-Conditioning at Stevens Institute of Technology,"Description
Low-flow liquid desiccant air-conditioning (LDAC) avoid problems such as reducing sensible cooling loads, unwanted solar gains and internal heat gains by providing dehumidification. LDAC is a new technology with the innovation design of deeply drying the air before it enters the main cooling system without the need for overcooling and reheating. Some of the main additional benefits it has are: (a) avoids the increased fan energy associated with solid desiccant systems, (b) allows more efficient ways to remove heat of sorption than is possible in solid desiccant systems, (c) eliminates the desiccant carryover problem, thereby reducing maintenance requirements compared to high-flow LDAC systems, etc. Finally LCAC systems offer improved product shelf life from improved humidity control and it has the ability to optimize temperature and humidity to increase worker comfort and productivity.

Building Description
Therefore, an LCAC systems was used in the Schaefer Athletic and Recreation Center at Stevens, which houses a 45 ft x 75 ft swimming pool. The major problem in pools is the maintenance of dry indoor air conditions for comfort, and the elimination of mold and mildew problems from condensation. Then, drier air increases the pool water evaporation rate, which increases the need for pool water heating. The space is conditioned and dehumidified by an air handling unit (AHU) that processes return air and OA and includes chilled water coil supplied by a central plant chiller, and preheat and reheat hot water coil supplied by a central boiler.

Implementation
The LDAC system was installed in Schaefer Center in August 2012. It was designed to condition 100% recirculation air, which was supplied to the air jets along the perimeter windows and it runs continuously because the continuous evaporation of pool water kept the dehumidification loads relatively constant. The LDAC is able to remove latent loads from the air and generate sensible energy that can be directed back to the pool water. This design uses the pool water to remove the heat of absorption in the LDAC conditioner, which reduces the energy to heat the pool and the energy to cool the supply air from the LDAC. Finally, the system can use waste heat or heat generated as part of a combined heat and power gas (CHP) cogeneration system to regenerate the desiccant.","Outcome
The LDAC performed very well at the Schaeffer Center pool. The pool condition and water temperatures were maintained at desirable levels, and more benefits were gained from the relationship between the pool operation and LDAC operation. The system provided all the pool heating (with no auxiliary heating required), space condition were as desired,and the vapor compression AHU was doing minimal dehumidification. while the outdoor conditions were hot and humid. Finally, in August 2012 the facility manager reported the LDAC system was performing better than expected and reports from pool occupants were outstanding.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/808/6/582/3264/Innovation%201_1.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/60695.pdf,True,--,--,--,--,True,True,--,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,--

Temple University,2016-02-09,2016-02-09 14:47:07,kathleen.grady@temple.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Bird Strike Mitigation Research,"Temple has been conducting research on bird collisions with campus building windows. Philadelphia is situated along the Atlantic Flyway migration route and bird collisions into windows are a major problem. Birds do not perceive glass as a solid object. They see a reflection of their habitat or nothing at all causing the bird to collide with the window and either die from impact or become injured. 

Temple has initiated the following strategies that have fostered research and collaboration among many departments on campus:

Collision Survey: In addition to Temple’s counting efforts, Audubon Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Zoo organized a survey of bird collisions in the spring of 2009 on Temple’s Main Campus. The buildings that had the most number of collisions on Main Campus are those that use highly reflective glass, buildings with vegetation situated close to windows or buildings with transparent or reflective glass walkways.

Hawk Models:  In the spring of 2010, eight 2-dimensional, life-sized models of bird eating hawks were created from photos and mounted on four collision prone buildings at Temple to see if bird collision rates were reduced in areas where the models were erected. This method of preventing bird collisions had never been tried before anywhere else in the world. This mitigation method was not effective at reducing bird strikes.

Window Film:  Research has shown that birds will avoid flying through spaces that are 2” high or less and 4” wide or less (2x4 rule). Window patterns that follow the 2x4 rule can be an effective means of mitigating bird collisions.

Window film has been tested in a variety of locations on Main Campus though student projects and research, including:

Tyler Graphic Design students designed patterns for window film in a juried competition. The winning design was installed on the Tuttleman-Paley connector walkway windows in partnership with SurfaceCare. The film has been an effective mitigation strategy.

Research project in Beury Hall, first floor west entrance and glass corridor where translucent squares and designs were installed on windows. Click to read more. 
Window Netting:  Window netting has been an effective and low-cost method of mitigating bird deaths and injuries by allowing birds to bounce off a taut net and not strike the window. A 2012 student research project aimed to test the effectiveness of window netting installed on buildings. The netting has been an effective mitigation strategy. 

Fritted Glass:  The installation of high density fritted glass has shown to be an effective method of mitigating bird strikes. Fritted glass has been installed on portions of Morgan Hall which opened in August 2013. Monitoring began in 2014 and has proven to be an effective mitigation strategy.  ","Ongoing monitoring has shown that netting, window film and fritted glass are effective bird-window collision mitigation strategies with a reduction of bird deaths found where strategies have been implemented.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/711/6/582/3264/TempleCoolSchoolLetter.pdf,True,True,**,True,Interdisciplinary,http://sustainability.temple.edu/birds,True,True,True,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--

This competition is based on the assertion that a market based solution which rewards innovation and risk taking has the potential to create a sustainable and significant new technology for addressing hypoxia.

Hypoxia occurs when excess nutrients flow from rivers to near-shore areas, depleting the oxygen required to support life. This can result in severe impairment of near-shore fisheries, consequently destabilizing the businesses, families and communities sustained by those fisheries. Further, nutrient enrichment can jeopardize the future of estuaries and coastal wetlands that depend on freshwater and sediment delivery for stability and persistence. In short, clean water is critical to the ecological, cultural and economic well-being of Louisiana, the nation and the world.

The UBC Sustainability Initiative (USI) Steering Committee, an internal governance body that provides strategic guidance and oversight to the Initiative, approved the Strategy on September 8, 2014. Following approval of the USI Steering Committee, the Strategy was presented to the UBC Board of Governors on 2 December, 2014. 

Building on 20 years of sustainability achievements at UBC, the Strategy is a response to a significant academic and operational opportunity to continue being at the forefront of the sustainability transition. The Strategy articulates a bold long-term vision and strategic goals that will catalyze next generation sustainability at UBC’s Vancouver campus, and embed it across teaching, learning and research, operations and infrastructure and the community.

The Strategy will guide institutional innovation and transformation, enabling the University to continue being a global leader that inspires not only a more sustainable campus community, but a more sustainable world. As an overall framework, it will enable UBC to further integrate dispersed sustainability efforts through the lens of regenerative sustainability, leverage the campus as a societal test-bed and create academic, operational and community collaborations and connections. 
The Strategy development process began in September 2013 with the formation of a Steering Committee, tasked with drafting the Strategy and guiding the engagement process. A comprehensive, eight-month campus-wide engagement process involved over 2,000 individuals including the Musqueam First Nations, community partners, students, faculty, and staff.

The Strategy provides an overall strategic direction for sustainability at UBC and a framework through which we operate and evaluate our activities. The 20-year Sustainability Strategy implementation will be ongoing. The Strategy provides long-term direction for sustainability and should be considered a living document to be updated in response to emerging circumstances and in consultation with appropriate stakeholders. Very few universities have such a long-term visionary document.
","The UBC 20-Year Sustainability Strategy represents a significant achievement of working with the UBC community. The development of the Strategy was directed by the 20-year Sustainability Strategy Steering Committee, chaired by the Associate Provost, Sustainability, and composed of 21 community members, including 5 faculty, 4 students and 4 staff, 4 external partners, and the University Neighbourhoods Association and the Musqueam First Nation. Feedback was sought widely from campus constituents, through an online survey and in-person workshop sessions.   

The engagement process was staged in two phases:
Phase 1 engaged the community in the development of a vision for sustainability through online and in-person opportunities for feedback that were communicated widely, including via a broadcast email. A campus wide survey indicated general support for the direction of the vision.

Phase 2 engaged the community in the development of strategic goals across the three pillars of teaching, learning and research, operations and infrastructure and community. Online and in-person opportunities to provide feedback were widely communicated.
Overall, 2,000 people were engaged, including 1,400 via an online survey and 800 through in-person opportunities. Approximately 5,000 people visited the project website. 

ENGAGEMENT ACHIEVEMENTS
- Over 2,000 people directly engaged
- 800 in-person engagement touch-points
- 1368 online survey responses (64% students, 26% staff, 8% faculty, 2% others) indicating overall support for the Strategy
- 3 integrated faculty and staff workshops with total of 100 participants
- Sustainability Coordinators (staff) and Sustainability
- Ambassadors (students) workshops
- 2 open houses for on-campus and neighbourhood communities
- 3 community booths at major campus events
- 10+ presentations to undergraduate and graduate students councils and groups, the UBC staff association, the neighbourhood association, and at several community events, including the UBC Farm Symposium and the Student Leadership Conference

In the fall of 2015, over 19,000 participants (4+% of UC’s population) took up the on-line gamified challenge to reduce their personal and campus carbon footprints, including students, staff and faculty from all 10 UC campuses as well as the UC Office of the President. The challenge included 37 different pledges, targeting actions anyone can take on an everyday basis to reduce their energy and carbon footprint from lighting, computer use, purchasing, heating and cooling, and transportation. 

The Cool Campus Challenge (CCC) is collaboration between the University of California system, UC’s Global Climate Leadership Council, and UC Berkeley's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory. Together over the last year a UC team of practitioners, in partnership with RAEL, created a university specific tool that gets at the actions that reduce the carbon footprint in offices, labs, classrooms, and residence halls.  Sustainability officers and student leaders across UC played a key role in implementing the CCC on their campuses – creating interesting and engaging activities to draw in participants.  Additionally, communications staff at UC Office of the President utilized the CCC to draw broader exposure to the UC carbon neutrality initiative and to the University and President’s leadership in this area.

The CCC is a good example of what a living laboratory means - it furthers the climate behavioral research of RAEL, engages large numbers of people in the community to action, and results in measurable positive impacts in operations.  



","Here are some exciting results of the CCC across the UC system:

   -Over 19,000 members joined in on the inaugural Cool Campus Challenge, with students and staff participating with enthusiasm. That’s 4% of the whole UC system!
    -122,000 carbon reducing pledges were taken and 6,000 related events were attended by participants.
    -Together Challenge participants will reduce 20 million pounds of carbon emissions each year with their new actions. That is 7,000 metric tons of CO2 - equivalent to taking 2,000 cars off the road.
    -The UC carbon reducing collective action grew–across the system 450 teams came together to challenge each other to knock back emissions.
    -And, we appreciated each other – 2,500 carbon heroes were nominated, ranging from inspiring staff implementers, to student leaders, to faculty mentors.
    -Creativity and communication about the Carbon Neutrality Initiative abounded on social media and through campus outreach efforts. 1,600 posts were made to #UCool.
    -UC Leadership engaged from President Napolitano, to Chancellors, to Deans and to student leadership.
    -We inspired others globally - Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme and Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations highlighted the Cool Campus Challenge at the UC Climate Summit at UC San Diego.
    -While all the campuses and UCOP made amazing efforts for which all will be recognized , UC Irvine has been honored as the inaugural Coolest UC.  UC’s smallest but mighty campus UC Merced took 2nd place and UCLA  landed cooly and inspiringly in 3rd.  

At Berkeley 1,750 faculty, staff and students joined the challenge!  Our collective actions will reduce 1,021,720 million of pounds of carbon emissions each year.  Berkeley had particularly high involvement of teams based on campus departments and organizations, and nominations of climate heroes.

UC San Diego has installed a 2.5 MW / 5 MWh advanced energy system, composed of lithium ion iron­phosphate batteries. Our goals with this project were three­fold: to save money, improve the operation & reliability of our microgrid operation, and facilitate research and education on advanced energy storage. The project saves money by reducing our on­peak and non­coincident peak demand and by shifting electricity usage from on­peak periods to less expensive off­peak periods. The system improves the operation of our microgrid by giving us flexibility to charge and discharge electricity at a moment's notice. The system provides reliability by offering 5 megawatt­hours of battery backup electricity. Ths project installed a 2.5 MW / 5 MWh advanced energy system made by BYD of China. The system is composed of lithium ion iron­phosphate
batteries. It is the first project of its kind in the University of California and California State University System, and is very applicable to every campus that is looking to increase the reliability and resiliency of its power grid.
This project received a ""Self­Generation Incentive Program"" (SGIP) incentive from San Diego Gas & Electric of $3.2 million. The incentive was capped at 60% of the total project cost. Best practices include our fire safety system, our challenges with ensuring UL ratings on the entire system, our success in securing an SGIP incentive, and our success with offsetting a significant portion of our on-­peak electricity use. 

On-­campus stakeholders included Facilities Management (High Voltage, Metering, Energy Management, & the Central Plant), Environmental Health & Safety's Fire Marshall, Facilities Design and Construction, the Budget Office, and the Center for Energy Research. The Fire Marshall and Electrical Inspectors were particularly important stakeholders, since the area of large­-scale energy storage is quite new, and codes on the safety of these systems and UL ratings are either new or non­existent. Large-­scale battery systems are notorious for being fire hazards. Rather than installing lithium ion batteries, which can generate fires that cannot be extinguished with water, the campus installed lithium ion iron­phosphate batteries. Per the Fire Marshall's requirement, the campus installed a redundant fire safety system as well. The academic Center for Energy Research (CER) at UC San Diego is also a major collaborator. CER was awarded a $3 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency­Energy (ARPA­E) to help move innovative energy storage technologies out of the lab and into the market. Using the advanced energy storage system, CER will help test and validate the performance of ARPA­E-­funded technologies through a program called Cycling Hardware to Analyze and Ready Grid­Scale Electricity Storage (CHARGES). SDG&E was also in important stakeholder, as this project offers added resilience and reliability to the San Diego power grid. In the event of an emergency, this system could dispatch an additional 2.5 MW to the San Diego power grid. The UC Office of the President (UCOP) is an key collaborator as well. Having recently become an Energy Service Provider, is subject to the CPUC requirement that energy providers procure a minimum amount of energy storage. The UC San Diego system may contribute to meeting that minimum requirement.

The advanced energy storage installation is the most recent addition to our growing East Campus Energy Park, which is designed to be an educational tool, both for students, faculty, and industry leaders who want to see their technology in action. The East Campus Energy Park is one of the key nodes of the UC San Diego microgrid, recognized by EnergyWire in their March 2014 issue to be ""the most celebrated and sophisticated of the region's microgrids.""
UC San Diego hosts frequent tours of the facility, with attendees ranging from local high school students to CPUC Commissioners and Navy Admirals. The most recent tour, in February 2016, was given to 17 graduate students visiting from Paris, France, who are studying the ""Optimization of Energy Systems"" at the National Superior School of Mines ­ Paris (known also as Paris MineTech). These education and outreach efforts are of course in addition to the DOE Research Grant mentioned in the section above.","The fuel cell has generated more than 40 million kWh of electricity since it began operation in November 2011 and runs on 100% biogas. The energy storage project received a ""Self­Generation Incentive Program"" (SGIP) incentive from San Diego Gas & Electric of $3.2 million. As a result of this project, 2.5 MW and 1,825,000 kWh/year have been shifted from on-­peak to off­-peak times, saving $490,000 a year. The advanced energy storage system may prove to have additional economic value beyond its original evaluation by allowing UC San Diego to bid available power on the open electricity market.

The Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts (ISEECI) received $1.9 million in funding, the largest of the new President's Research Catalyst Awards announced by UC President Janet Napolitano. UC Santa Cruz biologist Barry Sinervo will lead the institute, which involves all of UC's undergraduate campuses. The NRS is the world's largest system of university-administered natural reserves, offering a powerful opportunity for scientists to study how climate change will affect California ecosystems and the ecosystem services that people rely on.

ISEECI is focused around four main research themes: Climate and Land Use History; Coastal-Terrestrial Linkages; Studying the Future; and the Effects of Drought. For a snapshot of how the institute approaches its research, the Climate History focus group integrates diverse data from biological to geochemical systems and combines them to create a more detailed climate history. California climate history is well understood in broad brushstrokes but not in detail. By combining historical climate information from tree, shrub, and animal growth rings with climate information from packrat middens, pollen records in lakes and other sources, they will start to build a uniquely granular picture of California climate history. To integrate the historical data with the current conditions ISEECI is currently building a network of sensors that will measure the sensitivity of biological systems to climate change, including instruments to measure animal and plant physiology. These data will allow researchers to tease apart the sensitivities and responses of the ecosystem components to changes in climate. Increasing the understanding of the variation in these responses will enable the research to be translated into sustainable and effective land management processes in the face of climate change, and potentially generate ways in which to mitigate against future effects and allowing the sustainable management of ecosystem services.  

ISEECI researchers will assemble historical records, establish a new system for data collection, and conduct experiments and long-term monitoring studies across the state. Although there have been many in-depth studies documenting climate impacts, they have largely been done independently, with results that are difficult to compare among studies. ISEECI will pursue a coordinated approach across broad geographic scales. Researchers will develop models to predict future changes to ecosystems and potential impacts on ecosystem services that might threaten the capacity of Californians to adapt to a changing climate.

University of Colorado Boulder,2016-03-03,2016-03-03 07:49:50,dave.newport@colorado.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Sports sustainability fan engagement,"CU Athletics has begun using it leadership in sports sustainability to influence their fans to implement personal sustainability behaviors in their own lives, homes, and workplace—in order to be “part of the team.” This is a new extension of CU's ""Ralphies Green Stampede"" (RGS) program that established the nation's first zero waste athletics program in a NCAA Division 1 stadium in 2008. 

The new strategy began with eight ""Sustainable Gameday"" basketball games during Spring 2014 and will continue through Fall football and 2015 basketball seasons. Fan behavioral change targets are recycling, composting, water conservation, and energy conservation activities.

During Sustainable Gamedays, fans were informed of the ongoing zero waste activities in athletics and in the university. Fans were also exposed to messaging about how to properly separate recyclables and compostables. By various means, fans were then asked to implement these behaviors in the own ""homes, work and play.""

See:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw35kOQrHucISFdxdUVSWkJqZjA/edit?usp=sharing

Similar but stronger messaging has occurred during Fall 2014 football games. Signage and announcements in stadium and tailgate zones challenge fans to consider ""What kind of Buff will you be?"" The messaging then goes on to inform fans of sustainability activities in the stadiums--and, most importantly, how fans can ""run with Ralphies Green Stampede"" by being a ""water wise Buff"" or a ""zero waste Buff"" and practicing these behaviors at home. 

See:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYHdLamfPg&feature=youtu.be

Contests are run in ZW tailgate zones (Franklin Field) and through RGS Facebook site with winners receiving game balls, coolers, etc, for participating in tailgate composting activities, posting 'selfies' of themselves recycling, or being the first to enter time-limited contests on FB.

See: https://www.facebook.com/RalphiesGreenStampede","Measurable outcomes include increases in recycling and composting rates in fans' homes. Post activity assessment indicated that 8% of fans reported increases in recycling and 4% of fans reported increased composting as a result of the ""Sustainable Gameday"" program in basketball. Additionally, 54% of fans surveyed reported it was 'somewhat likely"" or ""very likely"" that they would increase pro-environmental behaviors in their homes as a result of learning about it and observing it during the ""Sustainable Gamedays.""

Likewise, in March of 2014, the Sustainable Gameday Fan Engagement campaign also served to organize community zero-waste stakeholders who met and discussed a ""Roadmap to Success"" related to increasing composting in the community. Fifty-four community members and partner organizations (K-12 system, Girl Scouts, other NGOs, City, and County reps) self selected a one year of doubling Boulder's composting rate. That effort is underway through RGS, Sustainable Gamedays, and leveraged through the outreach from partner community groups.

Furthermore, the 2012-2020 Strategic Plan identifies education enhanced by wellness through recreation as a key component of the UCCS campus experience.

In 2014, in support of these strategic planning documents, UCCS published the Recreational Trails Micro Master Plan, an ancillary document to our 2012 Campus Master Plan, to provide ""a unique asset for student recruitment, and a means for physically engaging students and faculty with the campus' stunning natural landscape resource while contributing to their health and wellness.""  The trail system will be open to the campus and the community for non-motorized and appropriate multi-use recreation and transportation..

The trails system supports the campus' valuable natural and cultural resources that are critical to successfully developing UCCS for future generations.  Outdoor recreation and individual wellness are core commitments for the campus community.  Trails are a crucial part of our heritage, our transportation network and our commitment to sustainability and social trails degrade the natural capital of the campus.

The goals of this initiative are:

• Create a world-class trail system engaging the unique natural landscape and contributing to UCCS's sense of place,
• Protect the natural environment by minimizing impacts to the local fauna, flora, and soils while providing a robust trail system for recreation and transportation,
• Accommodate campus development by creating a trail system that connects and unifies campus destinations,
• Integrate the UCCS trail system with adjacent public trails, parks and open spaces, as well as housing, retail and employment centers, and
• Recommend campus-wide initiatives to further the University goals of sustainability, education, and holistic health and wellness.

The UCCS Recreational Trails Micro-Master Plan envisions the campus as an area that offers all people the opportunity to experience this unique and beautiful place. The focus is on providing access through a variety of multi-use trails and the support facilities needed to serve them. Trails throughout the site are planned to accommodate a wide range of abilities and interests, and to offer a variety of experiences that will make multiple visits engaging, informative and interesting. The plan also allows for related trailside gathering areas, interpretive sites, trails with additional attributes for sight impaired interpretation and designation of themed routes (e.g. curriculum based geology, biology, wellness, etc. and a cross country venue). Trailheads have also been identified at key connections to the system.

The Recreational Trails Micro-Master Plan is a specific yet flexible roadmap that will guide creation and maintenance of a sustainable trail system for the UCCS campus community.

The efforts pursued through GCAN will promote a more sustainable community by encouraging broader involvement and connectivity between sustainability, academics, research, and co-curricular programs. For more information: http://www.ecohusky.uconn.edu/engagement/COP21Hub.html","Since its inception roughly one year ago, several collaborative projects between the UConn Office of Environmental Policy (OEP) and the members of GCAN have been undertaken in an effort to improve the University's sustainability efforts.

One professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering collaborated with the OEP to display air quality data obtained regularly from sensors located throughout campus on the interactive Energy Dashboards stationed in two of UConn's buildings.  Additionally, her students provided feedback on how to improve upon the Energy Dashboard displays to make them more appealing for students to use.

The OEP offered guidance to two professors, one in the Department of Geography and the other in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, on how to incorporate sustainability measures specific to UConn into their course curriculum.  The OEP also facilitated tours to some of the green features on campus that were relevant to the course curriculum.  Finally, the director of the OEP was invited to act as a guest lecture on the topic of sustainability for each class.

The instructor of a course in the ARE (Agricultural and Resource Economics) Department sought help from the interns and sustainability coordinators in evaluating the proposals her students brainstormed to resolve a variety of sustainability issues in and around campus.  The OEP representatives were invited to the class presentations of the proposals and were able to provide insight on the feasibility and the progress of the projects they has suggested.

Finally, the OEP collaborated with several faculty members to secure funding and develop the educational programming required to send several students, faculty, and OEP representatives to Paris during the first week of the 21st annual Conference of the Parties.  They organized a higher education networking event co-hosted by Second Nature, AASHE, and the Kedge Business School, that all of the constituents attended, and the faculty delivered morning lectures to the students involved that related to the COP21 proceedings.

In 1987, founding director Paul Chu began a legacy of innovation for the TcSUH by achieving superconductivity at the highest temperatures to date. Since then, the center has been regarded as one of the best superconductivity research facilities in the world impacting many areas of clean energy. See the section below for a groundbreaking innovation released in March 2015. ","In March 2015, a research team in the TcSUH led by Zhifeng Ren, PhD, UH physics professor, created a new thermo-electric material known as germanium-doped magnesium stannide. The new material is intended to generate electric power from waste heat with greater efficiency and higher output power than currently available materials.

The material was created through mechanical ball milling and direct current-induced hot pressing. It can be used with waste-heat applications and concentrated solar energy conversion at temperatures up to 300 degrees Centigrade, or about 572 degrees Fahrenheit. Germanium-doped magnesium stannide has a high power factor, at 55 and a low raw material cost of about $190 per kilogram, which makes it more commercially viable than currently used materials. Thus, germanium-doped magnesium stannide offers to not only efficiently capture energy from waste heat, but also make solar energy applications more cost effective.

Typical applications include use in a car exhaust system to convert heat into electricity to power the car's electric system, boosting mileage, or capturing waste heat from a smokestack to power a plant's systems. UH researchers have formed a company called APower together with collaborators at MIT to commercialize the material for thermo-electric devices.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/38/6/582/3264/REN-TcSUH_expert%20letter.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.phys.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2015/0623-clean-energy.php,True,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,"Home page for the TcSUH: http://tcsuh.com/

UIC’s Green Labs Committee works to gather students, faculty and staff together to discuss the sustainability of research labs on campus, and in a broader dynamic.  Recently formed in 2013, UIC’s Green Labs group was formed to transform the discussion and practice around research labs, and how traditional laboratory space and use can be unsustainable.  The Committee meets on a regular basis to discuss topics concerning energy consumption, disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, how to reduce the waste and energy research labs, and others.  Green Labs is an originative Committee on campus that has taken the leap into finding new and direct ways to reduce waste, energy and financial costs within research labs.

b.     In addition to the Green Labs Committee, UIC has created the Green Labs Challenge in which departments and labs are encouraged to practice sustainable behavior in regards to energy management, laboratory supplies, chemicals, waste reduction and recycling, and network and engagement opportunities, by competing with one another.  The Green Labs Challenge has not only created positive, sustainable changes within UIC’s labs but has also encouraged behavioral changes throughout campus, by raising awareness around the sustainability of research labs on campus.

University of Louisville,2016-02-13,2016-02-13 03:02:43,justin.mog@louisville.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Nutrition Navigators and the UofL SmartPlate,"Nutrition Navigators (NN) is an innovative peer wellbeing coaching program at the University of Louisville. NN is coordinated by Health Promotion Wellbeing Central (HPWBC), in partnership with Sodexo Dining Services, Sustainability Council and Campus Health Services. The purpose of NN is to improve student health, enhance academic success and promote sustainability initiatives. NNs are student health advocates, trained by HPWBC and Sodexo professional staff to provide navigation services in food service venues on campus and also in individual Wellbeing Coaching sessions. The power of the model is simplicity: NN are coaching other students to adopt a new, easy way of thinking about their food choices that builds on these four key nutrition concepts. 
1.	Nutrient Density - focus on the quantity and variety of nutrients in a food portion, relative to energy content. 
2.	Caloric Density - consider the energy content (calories) relative to portion size.  
3.	Portion determination involves matching how much you eat to your personal health and body weight goals.
4.	Local and sustainable - Choose food sourced locally and grown sustainably. 

Nutrition Navigators are on duty in undergraduate primary dining venues at strategic times throughout the week. During these times, Nutrition Navigators educate their peers about the UofL SmartPlate and the four key concepts described above while assisting them to navigate the various food station options and pointing out the locally grown foods available on the menu that day. As a result, eaters accomplish building a personalized “Smart Plate.” A major strength of this approach is that students are provided nutrition guidance at the point of decision, when they’re likely to be hungry and prone to habituated choices. This approach activates their confidence and ability to apply the four key concepts to food choices in future food-choosing situations. 

The Nutrition Navigators also aim to increase students’ nutrition I.Q. and raise nutrition awareness through the use of social media including Facebook, Instagram, and twitter. Students are encouraged to post pictures of their plates to social media sites and receive feedback on how to improve their meal selection. This promotes students’ critical thinking about their own nutrition skills and health status plus how to improve the health of our environment by the way we eat.
The overall goal of the program is to improve support students’ wellbeing through nutrition education and real-life experiences that provides students with the necessary tools to efficiently navigate campus dining venues, thus building resilience and improving academic success.  This larger goal is pursued through four primary objectives. 1. After meeting with a Nutrition Navigator, students will be able to decipher between nutrient dense and calorically dense foods. 2. Students will recognize and select portion sizes appropriate to their individual caloric needs. 3. Students will be able to assemble plates that resemble the “Smart Plate” with increasing skill level. 4. Students will report increased self-efficacy when it comes to navigating the dining hall and choosing nutrient dense meal options with local food options identified as exemplars. 
Through building relationships with key partners, Nutrition Navigators are able to contribute to the sustainability of our campus community in an even more impactful way. In addition to guiding students in the dining halls, Nutrition Navigators contribute to sustainability initiatives on campus through participating in Garden Commons workshops, coordinating NN Cooking Schools (using recipes that call for local and sustainably-grown ingredients), Belknap Campus Farmers’ Markets, bike blender smoothie demonstrations, Weigh the Waste events, National Arbor Day, and more. 
	Nutrition Navigators plan to continue to expand and build relationships on campus to contribute to the sustainability of the earth and the people who inhabit it. 
","Below is an accounting of the number of students reached by these programs throughout 2015:
Nutrition Navigators in the Ville Grill:	1850

It is intended to inform U-M administrators and others responsible for day-to-day operations of the University including its academic programs. Furthermore, it is intended to serve as a model demonstrating how behavioral research can be used to address critical environmental issues within universities generally and in other organizational settings.  Culture of sustainability is meant to reflect a set of attitudes, behaviors, levels of understanding and commitment, degrees of engagement, and dispositions among a population such as members of a university community. 

Two separate questionnaires are used for SCIP - one for staff and faculty, and one for students. While many of the questions are similar, different time frames and sequences are used in the two versions.  As a primary objective of SCIP is to work closely with the U-M sustainability goals, questionnaire modules were developed with questions focusing on transportation, waste prevention, the natural environment, food, climate change, as well as U-M sustainability efforts, and respondent demographics.  Since 2012 approximately 6000 members of the campus community have completed the questionnaires each year.  This includes roughly 4000 students and 2,000 faculty and staff.  

Annual SCIP reports are shared with the campus community noting changes since the previous year and trends over time.  A program website was also developed to share key results and materials. Between September 2013 and June 2014 there were over 1000 views of this website and the Year 1 report was one of the top ten file downloads from the Graham Institute website.  Meetings are held each year with more than a dozen campus groups to discuss results and these have already led to new initiatives and programs.  In terms of broader SCIP reach, more than 50 institutions across the US and in other countries have requested copies of the survey instruments.  Three book chapters and three journal articles have been produced on the SCIP process and results, and SCIP has been share at 12 major conferences. http://graham.umich.edu/leadership/scip",,**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/344/6/582/3264/STARS%20support%20letter%20for%20SCIP%20-%20R%20Wener.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,--,True,--,True,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,--

With its proximity to both strong academic departments and pioneering private and nonprofit enterprises, the STFS offers students the opportunity to pair academic studies in the environment, urban planning, geography, health, and related fields with practical experience delivered through internships and Capstone research projects.

The STFS is a unique and flexible field program that serves students in residence at UNC. Rather than spending a semester at another location with a small cohort, students participating in the STFS retain their established Chapel Hill residences, relationships and school base. They learn and grow as a group through common courses, Capstone team projects, field experiences, weekly dinners, and seminars. Internships place students at nonprofits, governmental entities and private companies around Chapel Hill and in nearby communities. Through these internships, students may take part in sustainability research, craft environmental education programs, or help develop a sustainable business model. By exploring how sustainability is practiced on and near their own campus, STFS students gain an understanding of how communities, industries, government and nonprofit organizations can work together toward a sustainable future.

The STFS accommodates up to 16 students each spring semester.","Around 45 students have participated in the Sustainable Triangle Field Site since spring 2011. Students have the opportunity to work with local businesses and organizations and complete a project and report during the internship. These partnerships prepare students for careers in sustainability and provide a service to local organizations.

"University of North Carolina, Greensboro",2016-01-26,2016-01-26 15:33:15,cgcarwei@uncg.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Peabody Park Soundscape Project,"The Peabody Park Soundscape Project centers around the concept of soundscapes. The term “soundscape” refers to the acoustic component of a landscape, unique to each and every place on Earth. Soundscape ecology is a new and developing area of research, especially with regards to campus soundscapes. In a way, the soundscape can be thought of as binding us to our environment. Engaging with soundscapes is therefore an important part of engaging with nature.

In February 2015, UNCG installed three interpretive signs in a natural area of its campus to raise awareness of soundscapes and call attention to issues of soundscape ecology.  The signs were conceptualized and designed by UNCG student William Hueholt, and funded in part by a competitive grant from UNCG’s Office of Sustainability. The signs are made of high-quality aluminum and are a semi-permanent installation, serving to draw attention to a unique part of campus in an innovative context.

The purpose of these signs is threefold: first, to simply help inform students of the existence of Peabody Park and the Park’s prairie; second, to elucidate various details of the distinctive soundscape of the Park; and third, to encourage students to listen deeply within the Park and other environments they experience.

Peabody Park is an ideal location for experiencing soundscapes not only because it contains a wide variety of plant and animal life but also because this life is easily observed by university students and visitors alike. The Park is home to a carefully-maintained Piedmont prairie, a fragile and rare native habitat that was recreated on campus through a partnership among Biology students and faculty, Grounds staff, and the Peabody Park Preservation Committee.  Beyond the prairie habitat, dense barriers of plants block significant amounts of traffic rumble, and the small size of the prairie keeps animal activity close to the path. Even the fragmented nature of the habitat within the Park lends itself well to sonic exploration, because very different soundscapes can be encountered within mere feet of each other. This underscores the importance of small habitat as well as provoking the question, “How would this sound if it were bigger?”

The primary outcome of this project is the installation of three 24”x30” informational signs throughout the western section of Peabody Park. The first sign, installed at the at the head of a path leading past a golf course, introduces and defines the term “soundscape,” gives an example of soundscape (via a visual graph), and touches on the ecological importance of soundscapes.  The second sign, placed just before the prairie, near a stream culvert, includes a colorful map of Peabody Park Prairie’s soundscape and information relating to the prairie’s sounds.  The third sign, placed just before the crest of a hill on the golf course, covers sustainability-related topics, including the developing concepts of sound equity and acoustic niches.  Each sign also includes a trail map, giving the Peabody Park recreational area some badly-needed visibility.

The theme of the Project is “what’s good for bees is good for people.” Honeybees thrive in a healthy environment, free of pesticides, herbicides, and pollutants, and with a rich variety of plants close by for collecting nectar and pollen. An aspect of this project is to create awareness of the human responsibility to maintain environments good for bees so that they can benefit us by pollinating plants and producing honey. This relationship is the very definition of sustainability. Participants in the monthly beekeeping workshops at the Apiary learn step by step how to take care of honeybee colonies and gain appreciation of the role of honeybees in local ecosystems. The USF campus and its ecosystems are the home range for the Apiary’s bees. In 2013 the class extracted 18 gallons of honey from seven of the Apiary’s hives. This honey was bottled and sold at the Botanical Gardens Gift Shop. Bee Class students also learn to tell the change of seasons by observing the kinds of pollen coming into the hives. One purpose of the bee workshops is to prepare students to become real beekeepers. In the March class they build their own hives. In April they take home live bees in a starter colony. The USF Apiary Project hopes that honeybee populations will increase by encouraging people to become responsible, informed beekeepers. This is of crucial importance now in the face of bee population decline worldwide. The USF Apiary Project is the only project of its kind statewide, based at a university and designed as community outreach and public education.

The initial concept for bike share at UVa was developed by students in the McIntire School of Commerce. 

UBike opened to the public in January of 2015 and consists of 18 stations and 120 bikes focused along the main travel corridors of campus and are strategically placed along primary bicycle, pedestrian, and transit routes.   Several stations are located within the Medical Center.

Members are able to find bikes at hub locations scattered throughout UVa’s campus or by looking online. They can reserve bicycles online, from SoBi’s mobile app, or directly from the keypads on the bikes.  At the end of their ride, members can park the bikes at any bicycle rack in the system area and share statistics about their ride with other riders. 

UBike enables point to point bicycle travel over short and medium distances.  It offers an innovative way to improve mobility, reduce overcrowding on transit, and improve safety.  UBike functions as an integral part of UVa's multi-modal transportation network, offering a new and sustainable means of moving around the University Grounds.  The system functions in coordination with other modes to enhance the
overall efficiency and effectiveness of the network.  UBike is one of only a few bikeshare systems servicing and operated by a University or College.  In addition, the gps and software technology that operates the system is innovative among bikeshare types because it is self-contained on the bike.  This means that the modular docking stations do not require a power source and can be easily moved and set up in alternate locations if demands patterns show a need.  It also means that ride routes can be mapped and analyzed and used to improve the system layout and provide valuable bike infrastructure planning information.
","As noted above, the UBike system allows for detailed tracking of system usage beyond typical origin/destination information.  Since launching the system in January until the middle of April 2015, the system has experienced 1,725 total trips and 1,095 miles traveled.  This equates to $519 dollars saved and, more importantly, 789 lbs of carbon avoided versus driving.

The clinic relies on volunteers and a small paid staff, who reach out to people of all ages and walks of life that have difficulty accessing medical care due to financial constraints and lack of insurance coverage.  The clinic and its staff are committed to providing quality care, in a nonjudgmental environment to anyone in the community who is without access to basic care.

The LHCC provides the following services free of charge:
-Primary, non-emergency, medical care for health problems.
-Medical care for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiac issues. -Limited dental care.
-Prescription medication (no controlled substances).
-Health education and promotion
-Orthopedic Injections
-On-Site Mental Health counseling

The UW Oshkosh College of Nursing operates the Living Healthy Community Clinic with the support of community agencies. The clinic provides confidential, cost-effective medical care to underinsured people with high deductibles and uninsured people who currently do not have the money to pay for traditional health care. Services are provided on a sliding fee scale based on each individual's ability to pay.","            The LHCC is a model for addressing local needs at the local level by forming partnerships and strategic alliances within the community.  The clinic continues to exist because the community takes their “social contract” to heart with their pocketbook. The three major health care providers in Winnebago County include Affinity Health Care, Aurora Medical Group ($60,000), and ThedaCare ($30,000), all three are active financial donors to the clinic.  In addition, they donate lab and basic diagnostic services on a quarterly rotation.  The clinic pays $1 a year in rent to Affinity Health Care and Aurora Medical Group provides housekeeping, medical waste removal, and outside maintenance with no charge to the clinic.   
Other major funders include the Mercy Health Foundation-MHF ($100,000), Oshkosh Area United Way ($23,000), the Oshkosh Area Community Foundation ($10,000), and the City of Oshkosh through a Community Development Block Grant ($10,0000), Winnebago County ($124,600-reducing funds by $25,000 a year over next four years), The Kuenzl Foundation ($10,000), Fisk Gallop Fund ($10,000), JJ Keller Foundation ($25,000-included in MHF funds), US Venture ($25,000-included in the MHF funds), and the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.

Historically, the Eastern Oyster was a significant part of the Chesapeake Bay economy and by the late 19th century the harvest was approximately 17 million bushels of oysters per year. Today, the population is estimated to be at only one to two percent of the peak number. The most recent harvest numbers of oysters was in excess of 400,000 bushels, which is a significant increase from the 2001 harvest of 23,000 bushels; however, this is still far from the historic sustainable population. The 400,000 bushels generated an estimated $42 million in revenue for the 2013 year and is a growing employer helping the local coastal economies.

VCU Rice Rivers Center piloted a successful Richmond regional effort to collect restaurant-generated oyster shells for the purpose of enhancing the Chesapeake Bay oyster restoration efforts at sanctuary sites, called the Virginia Oyster Shell Recycling Program (VOSRP). Beginning in May, 2013, VCU partnered with the Virginia Green Travel Program, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, City of Richmond, Tidewater Fiber Corporation, Virginia Master Naturalist Program, Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program, and four Richmond-based restaurants (Rappahannock Restaurant, Lemaire at the Jefferson Hotel, Acacia Mid-Town, and Pearl Raw Bar) to collect used oyster shell that was being directed to the landfill. The purpose of this pilot was to demonstrate a proof of concept and feasibility analysis to determine if the necessary components could be developed to collect this restaurant-generated shell. The pilot project was essentially a zero-budget approach to coordinate partners around the single vision, to collect and return used oyster shell to the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay for the purpose of wild oyster restoration. The VCU Rice Rivers Center, partnering with the Virginia Green Travel Program, coordinated the initial efforts to obtain participation from the restaurants and the Virginia Master Naturalists.",,**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/260/6/582/3264/STARS%20oyster%20letter.pdf,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.vcu.edu/rice/education/vosrp.html,True,--,True,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--
Warren Wilson College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:29:57,aclimo@warren-wilson.edu,2.0,Pursuing,WWC Campus a National Wildlife Federation Certified Wildlife Habitat,"Through careful stewardship, the 1,100-acre Warren Wilson College campus has long been known as one of the nation’s most beautiful and environmentally sustainable. Now the picturesque campus has achieved another distinction: National Wildlife Federation Certified Wildlife Habitat.

The NWF certification specifically recognizes efforts to improve habitat by providing essential elements needed by all wildlife: natural food sources, clean water, cover, host plants and places to raise young. Students in WWC biology professor Jessa Madosky’s fall semester Ecology class prepared the successful certification application after collecting data documenting work done by the College’s student landscaping crew.

“I chose to go to this school because of how it views the environment,” says Adaline Pann, a junior in the Ecology class who took photos as part of the application she and other students prepared. “Our landscaping crew takes special care to incorporate native plants and places for wildlife, as well as keeping it safe for people.”

Ecology classmate Caroline Franklin, a Warren Wilson sophomore, says she now sees the campus in a somewhat different light after working on the application.

“After looking around the school for things that were required for a suitable wildlife habitat, I have gained an appreciation for many of the trees, rocks and small streams,” she says. “It’s very humbling to know that there are animals that call this campus home just like we do. Of course we see squirrels and birds everywhere, but knowing that they have dozens of places to hide, raise young, eat and drink makes me feel like the school has done its part in aiding wildlife.”

One strength of the application was the heavy emphasis on native plant material on the Warren Wilson campus, including the landscaping crew’s continuing labor-intensive efforts to remove exotic plants.

“This certification highlights the amazing work Tom LaMuraglia and his landscaping crew have put into the campus,” professor Madosky says. “It has been a great learning experience for my students to learn about all the things they do to support wildlife on campus. It also was a great example of integrating work and academics in a way that benefits the learning experience.”

LaMuraglia, Warren Wilson’s longtime landscaping supervisor, says it’s gratifying to see the College’s efforts recognized by the National Wildlife Federation.

“I think it’s a symbol of our goal to reach the highest level of environmental stewardship we possibly can, especially in a learning environment,” LaMuraglia says. “We need to lead by example, and this gives us validation by a well-known organization that we’ve reached our environmental commitments in creating safe space and habitat for wildlife on our campus.”

The NWF Certified Wildlife Habitat program has helped people take action on behalf of wildlife for more than four decades. The program engages schools, businesses, churches, homeowners, parks and other institutions that want to make their communities suitable for wildlife.

Wartburg College,2015-04-27,2015-04-27 09:07:58,anne.duncan@wartburg.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Advanced Waste Management,"Although recycling in higher education is not innovative, we believe we have taken several steps which are not common practice. 

In spring 2014 our recycling partner, the City of Waverly, began transitioning their curbside recycling to single stream, placing plastic, paper, and metals in one container. Prior to this change items needed to be sorted. This sorting requirement meant we were able to place few recycling stations in academic areas as they took a lot of space. Most colleges would stop at just adding more containers, but we took the opportunity to make major changes. 

Our goal of the changes was to increase diversion by placing the waste management process in the hands of the user.

First, we added more Recycling and Waste Stations in public areas, within 50 -100 feet of every workspace, allowing easy access for recycling and landfill (trash) items. Prior to this change we had 1-6 stations per building, usually tucked in a corner, away from traffic. The containers are in main traffic paths, and now a very visible part of our campus. 

The second change was adding side-saddle receptacles, attached to existing containers in offices for waste diversion. Instead of purchasing all new containers, we cleaned up the existing trash containers, added a recycling label, and hung the side-saddles on them for trash collection. The second part of this change asked users to empty their recycling and waste at the stations hallway. Prior to this change, cleaning staff emptied trash containers, but not recycling, and process which deincentivizes users to divert by making it easier to throw stuff away. Our change put landfill and diversion as equals, leaving it to user to chose how to handle their waste. Our cleaning staff no longer have to visit each office to empty trash, saving them time, allowing us to save costs of staffing, which was done through attrition, not layoffs.

Third, waste containers were removed from lecture classrooms. Our classrooms do not generate waste, it was not logical to collect waste from them. Just like the national parks service, we ask our student to take out anything they bring in. Signs were provided to help during the transition.

Although some colleges have adopted some of these practices, we are unaware of any which has adopted all of them. Asking all your staff, including faculty and administration, campuswide, to take out their own trash, is not common practice and demonstrates the innovative change on campus.","We saw an 86% increase in recycling from 12/13 to 13/14 years. Considering the recycling changes did not actually change until 3/4 of the way through the fiscal year, the changes are more reflective of the increased awareness. Once the changes actually happened, we were unable to get accurate measurements on recycling due to a malfunctioning truck scale. However, we have seen reduction in landfill collection, and believe this is an indicator of changes to come. The equipment has been fixed, and as of January 2015 we have started collecting weights to have data going forward.",**,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/516/6/582/3264/Innovation%201%20letter%202015.docx,True,True,**,True,--,http://www.wartburg.edu/recycle,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--

Across campus, WMU has incorporated both retention and detention basins into the campus landscape providing retention basins for over 432 acres comprising 53.6% of campus as of 2012. These basins collect and retain water during periods of heavy precipitation and release it over time thereby reducing erratic flows, flooding, erosion, and generally improving the sustainability of our community and landscapes (on- and off-campus). Some of these basins are above ground and easily located, while others are below ground such as the massive infiltration basin beneath the Sangren Hall parking lot. WMU also showcases its dedication to proper management by partnering with other community stakeholders on stormwater programs within the  Kalamazoo River watershed.

As a state-permitted storm water entity, WMU falls within the nonpoint source load allocation of a phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) developed for the Kalamazoo River and Lake Allegan. To achieve the TMDL goal, loads were targeted in 2001 for a 43% reduction from April-June and 50% reduction from July-September. 
 
A TMDL compliance plan documents that WMU has implemented best management practices (BMPs) and achieved total phosphorus (TP) load reductions sufficient to meet TMDL Load Allocation compliance goals. The plan also provides a ‘road map’ relative to implementation of on-campus and off-campus stormwater BMPs to move WMU into a position of becoming ‘Stormwater Neutral TM’. 
","Recent outcomes include: 
-1998 baseline TP load = 764 lbs/yr 
-13 BMP projects installed since 1998 
-53% of WMU campus is presently treated 
-WMU cumulative TP reduction of 521.3 lbs/yr 
-68.2% reduction of 1998 baseline load
