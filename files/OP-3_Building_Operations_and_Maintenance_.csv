ASU's comprehensive Green Purchasing Policy covers energy, water, toxins and pollutants, biobased products, forest conservation, recycling, packaging, green building, and landscaping. http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/pur/pur210.html

All university buildings are covered by a Green Cleaning contract. The contractors are required to utilize green cleaning products and procedures.

Indoor Air Quality

The sustainable maintenance guidelines included within Arizona State University's Sustainable Design Guidelines apply to all buildings.

Approximately 75% of Arizona State University's buildings at the Tempe campus can be scheduled through the building automation system. This is a Johnson Controls Metasys system that is used to turn air handlers and pumps, etc. on and off according to the scheduling needs for a particular building, or zone within a building. Building occupancy needs are determined by academic, research, and administrative staff, then equipment schedules are optimized to prevent unnecessary run-time.

Room Temperature Conservation Guidelines – ASU's Tempe campus classrooms and offices are heated to no higher than 68° F, and cooled to no lower than 80° F to reduce the amount of energy used for space conditioning.

An evaluation and testing system is used to determine the best performance and packaging from companies' green products.  Products that have a high concentrated dilution ratio and metered with a handle dispenser are preferred because it reduces plastic packaging and product waste.  Rapid renewable and 100% recycled paper products with a green seal certification are used.  Additionally, motion sensors and upgraded LED lighting are a standardized practice for building maintenance.  i.e.
Sierra Hall Renovation:
• Replacement of all corridor 13 watt compact fluorescent
lamps with motion sensor LED fixtures.
• Replaced old plumbing fixtures with low flow fixtures.

Sutter Hall Renovation/Refresh:
• Replacement of all 13 watt compact fluorescent corridor lamps with motion sensor LED
fixtures.
• Replaced old plumbing fixtures with low flow fixtures.

Also, whenever practical, projects reuse materials such as ceiling
tiles and carpeting to minimize amount of materials being
thrown away needlessly.
Example: California Department of Public Health (2nd
floor of Folsom Hall), carpet tiles & ceiling tiles reused
along with furniture partitions.
Facilities Management will select more energy efficient fixtures, techniques and materials when an option exists.
Examples: Library 1001 for Global Education, various “Smart”
classrooms around the campus.","The campus complies with the CSU-wide Chancellor's Office sustainability policy that covers sustainability building practices for operations and maintenance.  The policy encourages all CSU campuses to continue to adopt an integrated design approach that includes sustainable materials and practices. It also requires new goals for energy conservation, and the purchase and generation of renewable power.  The following is an excerpt of the sustainable building practices policy:
Sustainable Building Practices
1. All future CSU new construction, remodeling, renovation, and repair projects will be designed with consideration of optimum energy utilization, low life cycle operating costs, compliance with all applicable energy codes (enhanced Title 24 energy codes) and regulations. In the areas of specialized construction that are not regulated through the current energy codes, such as historical buildings, museums, and auditoriums, the CSU will ensure that these facilities are designed to consider energy efficiency. Energy efficient and sustainable design features in the project plans and specifications will be considered in balance with the academic program needs of the project within the available project budget. (78-Adopt; 88-Revise; 01-Revise; 04-Revise; 14-Revise)
2. Capital Planning, Design and Construction in the Chancellor’s Office shall monitor building sustainability/energy performance and maintain information on design best practices to support the energy efficiency goals and guidelines of this policy. The sustainability performance shall be based on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) principles with consideration to the physical diversity and microclimates within the CSU. (05-New; 14-Revise)
3. The CSU shall design and build all new buildings and major renovations to meet or exceed the minimum requirements equivalent to LEED “Silver.” Each campus shall strive to achieve a higher standard equivalent to LEED “Gold” or “Platinum” within project budget constraints. Each campus may pursue external certification through the LEED process. (05-New; 14-Revise)",http://www.calstate.edu/cpdc/sustainability/policies-reports/documents/JointMeeting-CPBG-ED.pdf,--

Focus has been on new construction, retrofits, and new utility plants. Controls modifications and purchasing high efficiency equipment are routine practices. Emory's Utility Reduction and Energy Conservation Agreement (URECA) launched in 2011 in three phases to focus on controls changes, building envelope sealing, ductwork sealing, lighting modifications, and water conservation. URECA has covered 27 buildings in phases I, II, and Phase IV is underway.

To date, 8 of Emory's buildings have been retro-commissioned, and 6 more will be by Summer 2014. To date this has amounted to $1.5 billion in annual energy cost savings. The Sustainable Performance Program keeps these retro-commissioned buildings running efficiently by finding the building's optimal performance level through monitoring, testing, and automated alarming. The SPP will initially focus on HVAC and HVAC controls, but will also evaluate lighting and other electrical loads. 8 buildings have undergone SPP measures since 2012, and 6 more are on the docket for 2014.


Emory's Temperature Policy requires that controls be set for temperature between 68-76 degrees Fahrenheit. 

HVAC system shutdowns are scheduled during unoccupied time periods in many buildings. 

Laboratory air exchange rates were lowered from 10 ach to 8ach during unocuppied times, and sensors are installed in newer labs to adjust air exchange rates higher or lower depending upon the activity and the quantity of air contaminants.

Green cleaning practices apply to all Emory University buildings maintained by Campus Services' BRS team.  At a minimum this is managed through the environmentally conscious purchase, use and disposal of materials and equipment to ensure a safe and healthy environment for not only building occupants but staff, as well.

","The Sustainable Performance Program ensures the continuation of sustainable building operation through its ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and documentation. 

All green housekeeping products are purchased and managed through procurement who ensure only approved products are bought and utilized by the BRS staff.   Training is performed regularly to keep staff safe during application.

Through these projects, GW aims to reduce energy use from the buildings by 15%. 

GW has also engaged a number of energy services companies to more closely monitor and manage the real-time energy use of our buildings and to employ demand response more effectively.

In addition, all on-campus buildings are cleaned using green cleaning techniques and are transitioning to blue cleaning techniques.  The university has been certified by a third-party organization for its green cleaning techniques used at the Mount Vernon and Foggy Bottom Campuses. 

GW contracts its housekeeping management through ARAMARK and exclusively uses Green Seal certified cleaning practices, which have been used on campus for more than five years. GW and ARAMARK are in the process of transitioning all of its purchased cleaning products used on campus to ""blue cleaning"" products that substitute electrically activated water (EAW) for chemicals used previously in its green products (see: http://www.aramark.com/~/media/Files/next-generation-of-blue-cleaning.ashx). Please refer to the link above to learn more about ARAMARK's blue cleaning program, and the health and environmental benefits it offers beyond those of existing green cleaning products. Additional links are provided below on the specific blue cleaning technology implemented to date on GW campuses.

In FY13, we made our most significant investment in using blue cleaning EAW solutions in lieu of Green Seal, chemical-based cleaning products. To date GW has installed 8 Orbio machines (see: http://www.tennantco.com/am-en/equipment/innovations/innovations/5000-sc) and 25+ ec-H20 machines (see: http://www.tennantco.com/am-en/equipment/Innovations/Technology/ec-h2o) to process tap water into a electrically charged blue cleaning water solution. In addition, GW implemented microfiber cleaning at its Mt. Vernon and Virginia campuses to cut down on use of chemicals and paper-based cleaning cloths/towels. Such measures have reduced GW's total expenditures on cleaning products by more than $20,000 in FY14 relative to FY12.",The Office of Sustainability works within the Division of Operations to ensure that the university continues to make progress on sustainable building operations. In particular the Office tracks progress on GHG emissions resulting from the Eco-Building Program. The Office also maintains connection with and an understanding of sustainable cleaning techniques in operation in the university buildings. ,http://sustainability.gwu.edu/green-building,"Energy use in existing buildings comprises 80 percent of the university's GHG emissions. In the first years of implementing the Climate Action Plan, GW prioritized improving building energy efficiency and enhancing IT systems that result in energy use reductions.

When managing and retrofitting its buildings for sustainability, GW deals with many complexities due to the diversity of buildings. GW owns and operates more than 150 buildings on its three campuses. Some pre-date the turn of the last century, and most require historic preservation during upgrades.  The sizes range from less than 10,000 square feet (historic town houses) to more than 200,000 square feet. "

Over the past 10 years, the Facilities Management Department at LUC has constructed new, high-efficiency buildings and completed major retrofits and renovations to improve older and historic buildings. In fact, Loyola's electric and natural gas usage and cost per square foot has dropped by 62% since 2001 and continues to decrease. To illustrate, this decrease saves almost 30,000 metric tons of CO2 from being emitted to the atmosphere each year. This is equivalent to saving the burning of 150 rail cars full of coal or 360 tanker trucks full of gasoline!

In recent years, Loyola has committed all new construction & renovations, where possible, to at least a Silver rating through the US Green Building Council's LEED certification. 

For existing or historical buildings on campus, Loyola encourages the development of innovative opportunities for energy savings. For example, a collaboration between Solomon Cordwell Buenz (architects), Argonne National Laboratory (building science), Elara Engineering (mechanical and electrical engineering), and Loyola, Dumbach Hall was retrofitted to achieve at least 30% improvement in energy performance.

2.1 Campus Development
In campus planning NC State will minimize the environmental footprint of
campus, consider the needs of present and future generations, and be aware of
connections with the greater Raleigh area. New development requires efficient
use of existing space through the implementation of space and utilization
standards, effective management strategies, and strategic reinvestment.
For development, NC State incorporates sustainability into comprehensive
master plans and design and construction guidelines. All buildings are
constructed in accordance with comprehensive master plans, design and
construction guidelines and high performance building standards. Capital
investment decisions utilize life cycle costing.
• The Physical Master Plan guides the future, physical development of
campus, holistically connecting natural systems, utilities, structures and
roads.
• Updates to the Physical Master Plan occur on a cycle of five to seven
years and modifications to Sustainability Guiding Principles and standards
will be incorporated with the update. Campus expertise assists with the
master plan update.
• Space needs are assessed every three to four years. This includes space
projections by space type (classroom, class lab, office, research, studio,
library and other) based on enrollment projections and academic plans.
Space utilization is evaluated using the University of North Carolina
General Administration space standards for teaching spaces and office
space. The University Space Committee determines space reallocation or
reassignment for under-utilized space.
• Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) silver certification
must be met or exceeded in all major campus construction projects. State
statutes for high performance buildings includes new construction and
renovations of buildings when the cost is greater than 50% of the
insurance value and the project is larger than 20,000 gross square feet of
occupied or conditioned space, as defined in the North Carolina State
Building Code.
• All projects not subject to the LEED mandate must adopt a sustainability
statement in the scope of project. This applies to new construction projects
and renovation projects in publicly owned or privately owned buildings as
well as leased and partnership properties.
• Priority is given to holistic building and property modifications that
maximize efficient and effective resource use.
• The Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan establishes projects to create a
pedestrian-friendly campus that encourages walking and biking.
• The Heritage Tree Plan is revisited every five years.
• Design and Construction Guidelines and other design and construction
contract agreements must advance sustainability. ","There are departmental operating documents that fall under the sustainability SOP, and we are evaluating LEED for Existing Buildings through the LEED Lab course to learn best practices for operations and maintenance for Facilities, Colleges, and Campus Life.",http://policies.ncsu.edu/sites/default/files/Sustainability-SOP.pdf,LEED Laboratory Course is helping with this effort.

Green cleaning chemicals are used when the option is available and equally as effective as its conventional counterpart. Currently, Green Seal certified products are used for all daily cleaning needs. The paper products that we stock are manufactured by Eco Soft and are Green Seal Certified. Both our tissues and paper towels are made from 100% recycled materials, as well as the core and box are 100% recycled material. Our hand soup products are GS-41 certified. All vacuums on campus meet or exceed the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) requirements for efficiency. The college is in the process of 100% conversion to Windsor Sensor vacuums. The Windsor vacuum is LEED qualifying with CRI SOA Silver Performance and noise levels less than 70 dBA. 

Oberlin College recycles carpet after its use on campus. In 2003 the college won the State of Ohio Department of Administrative Services STS Recycler of the Year Award for the amount of carpet it recycled. 

Oberlin College uses Sherwin Williams paints in all campus buildings. These paints have no odor, no silicates, and no volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Oberlin protects the health of the campus community by carefully selecting products such as these that will not negatively impact indoor air quality.","Oberlin College has developed a Building Construction Standards and Performance Guidelines document for building construction and management. This document lays out standards and guidelines (in addition to USGBC LEED) for selecting materials, vendors, and contractors during construction projects. The document includes sustainability provisions such as proper waste disposal, preferring the use of recycled carpets, protection of trees, erosion control, “no incandescent fixtures”, low VOC finishes, ensuring safety and security, building automation controls, Oberlin College’s diversity and non-discrimination policy.
As stated, the Oberlin College Board of Trustees adopted a policy that all new construction and major renovations on campus have to be designed and built in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) silver standard or equivalent.
Current LEED buildings on campus include: William’s Field House (2009): LEED NC 2.2 Gold, Bertram and Judith Kohl Building (2010): LEED NC 2.2 Gold, Allen Memorial Art Museum (2011): LEED Gold, and Kahn Hall (2010) NC Silver. Kahn is sustainability-themed first-year residence hall. Its sustainable design and in-depth energy metering through the Campus Resource Monitoring System provide students the opportunity to explore how their actions affect their resource usage. The historic Apollo movie theater renovation was LEED certified in 2012.  In addition:
•	In the fall of 2006 a group of students brought the idea of a sustainable living theme house called SEED, Student Experiment in Ecological Design, to the administration. The first phase of renovations were conducted in the summer of 2007 and students moved into the house in fall ’07. Additional renovations and retrofits are anticipated over the coming years. The house accommodates a total of eight students and is designed to spread the advantages of sustainable living into the local community.
•	Oberlin College’s most impressive green building, however, isn’t LEED certified – it was built prior to LEED. The Adam Joseph Lewis Center (AJLC) for Environmental Studies was one of the first and most innovative green buildings on a college campus. It helped launch the green building movement of the mid-1990s and its innovative systems have since inspired green buildings in many other locations and settings. In 2010, Architect Magazine polled 150 green building experts and named the AJLC the top green building built since 1980. The Living Machine processes wastewater into reusable grey water via the natural cleansing methods that occur in a wetland—plants, bacteria, protozoa, and other aquatic microorganisms are used to clean and condition the water for reuse. It is operated by a group of about 10 students. The Living Machine provides excellent opportunities for Oberlin College students and the community to explore issues of wastewater, wetland ecology, microbiology and plant dynamics. With the installation of a solar parking pavilion adjacent to the existing photovoltaic (PV) array on the roof of the innovative AJLC, Oberlin had the largest PV array in Ohio at the time, with a total rated production of 159 kW. By using the solar energy produced by the PV array and (geothermal) ground source heat pumps, the building produces most, if not more, than the energy it uses. Oberlin College hopes to continue our legacy in ecological design into the future.
Facilities Planning and Construction (FP&C) uses the principles of LEED Silver as a starting point, but then takes the principles of good, holistic design to push beyond LEED points, because after all, a building that people don’t like to be in is not a sustainable building regardless. The office employs skilled architects that can manage projects in order to create a holistic environment that is healthy and pleasing to building occupants. FP&C aims to ensure that all building users enjoy their experience in the building; this includes things that cannot be easily codified like creating a balanced atmosphere with pleasing colors, comfortable chairs, etc. Thus, because every project is different, each project is approached differently and customized for that project.

While Stanford has not formally pursued LEED-EBOM certification for any buildings where it doesn't align with the department's academic mission, a comprehensive LEED-EBOM (2009) equivalency analysis was completed in 2011/2012. The results of that study confirm universal certified-level equivalency with many buildings operating equivalent to a LEED-EBOM silver, gold, or even platinum performance. Stanford has not gone through the certification process for these buildings because this process has not been deemed compatible with the university's academic mission. In addition, in 2012–13, the Office of Sustainability began to develop a campus-wide sustainability Building Rating System. The vision for this project merges best practices from the LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations and Maintenance (EBOM) rating system with Stanford-specific metrics to tell a more complete story of building performance on campus. In 2015, the rating for each building was packaged into a school-level report card that quantifies sustainability performance for academic departments in six topic areas: energy, water, waste, transportation, purchasing, and occupant engagement. It also provides an action plan on how to improve the department’s sustainability performance using existing campus programs, providing a business case for each one. These school-level report cards were launched in early 2016.

Because of this, we have guidelines and policies around how are buildings are maintained, operated, and renovated that don't particularly fall into LEED and/or other green building councils. 

The buildings owned and operated by Sterling College are mostly an assortment of traditional and classic New England buildings. Because of this, Sterling puts more value in the energy contained within the living structure. By not pursuing LEED and other certifications, Sterling College not only saves money but also is able to reinvest and bring value back into the buildings. For instance, instead of investing in equipment required by LEED certifications, Sterling will invest in local companies to renovate the building to better standards. If a new building were built from the beginning, a large amount of material would have to be used and processed and shipped for the construction. Instead of this, Sterling renovates existing structures to become Net-Zero buildings, or buildings and structures that produce more energy than they expend. 

Net-zero buildings go beyond LEED and other certifications. Not only do they not cost as much to the community and environment with materials, but the energy that they save also saves the community. Overall, this policy has proved most effective and adheres to Sterling College's mission of environmental stewardship. 

Below is a statement from the 2013-2108 Strategic Plan that includes our mission related to Buildings and Maintenance:

""Sterling College will have well-maintained facilities appropriate to the aspirations of our community, our curriculum, and our values including environmental stewardship. To sustain such a campus will require that the College develop adequate funds to maintain and repair its facilities, equipment, tools, and other physical resources. The campus will be integrated into the community of Craftsbury Common and will present an appealing appearance to our neighbors with whom we will seek to share our resources.

Specifically, the College will endeavor to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and will commit to increasingly live by its commitment to environmental stewardship.

Goal: To restore and renovate the campus so that all buildings are efficient and attractive and serve the needs of the community and a population of approximately 120 students.""","Sterling College adheres compliance with these principles by purchasing only used buildings and renovating them. In the very rare case of building new buildings, Sterling believes that most resources can be had on campus. For instance, wood harvest by the college forestry crews and classes is then processed and turned into lumber for new buildings. A small shed built in the spring of 2014 is an example of this. All lumber was harvest on site and the building was built on site with almost not outside materials needed. The building may not be LEED certified, but is definitely more environmentally sound than most certified buildings. ",--,--

The team is a partnership between Design and Construction Management, Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, and the Facilities Management Energy Conservation Office. The team also works to implement campus-wide policies and programs that comply with LEED standards for building operations and maintenance. ","Here are some of the ways that UC Davis ensures compliance with sustainable building operations and maintenance guidelines and policies, as they relate to the areas in the criteria of this credit:

Building maintenance staff service a wide variety of equipment ranging from package AC units, chillers, gas heaters, walk in boxes, ultra-low freezers, supply, return, exhaust fans, cooling towers. They perform weekly, monthly and yearly preventative maintenance checks on equipment. They also repair and install new HVAC/R equipment for better temperature control and energy efficiency.

Facilities Management lighting technicians maintain the tens of thousands of lighting fixtures throughout campus classrooms, laboratories, and greenhouses. They provide proper disposal of hazardous waste generated by lamp and ballast replacement. They keep abreast of the rapidly changing technologies in lighting systems and equipment and play an integral role in the Smart Lighting Initiative, the goal of which is to reduce energy used for campus lighting by 60% by the year 2020. Facilities Management works in close collaboration with Utilities, Environmental Stewardship & Sustainability, and the California Lighting Technology Center to improve illumination while saving energy.

In 2006-08, UC Davis completed 35 infrastructure projects for an annual savings of 8.5 million kilowatt-hours per year and 2.8 million therms of natural gas. Cost savings for these projects are estimated at $3 million per year. The renovations have included air conditioning, monitoring systems, steam traps, central chilling plant conversion and lighting upgrades.

Facilities Management utilizes a holiday setback schedule in December to reduce energy waste during low-occupancy in many buildings. Additionally, many Air Handler Units (AHUs), Exhaust Fans (Efs) and associated zones (room temperature controls) are already being turned off or setback on a daily basis.

Custodial Services provides cleaning services for classrooms, conference rooms, halls and lobbies, laboratories, offices, restrooms, and stairways, as well as collect and manage the recycling throughout campus. UC Davis is planning for the entire campus to meet the goal of zero waste by 2020 and Custodial Services provides support services for zero waste events, including set up and clean up of special bins for recycling and composting. They even provide bins for office composting.

UC Davis administrative personnel are making an effort to reduce waste with a strategy called environmentally preferred purchasing. Departments are encouraged to consider existing resources, buy surplus or buy recycled products before considering other purchases. The campus purchasing system is online and prioritizes recycled products. Employees are instructed to consider an item's cost over its whole life cycle, including energy use, water efficiency, how quickly the product will need to be replaced and whether it can be recycled. Energy Star products certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are prioritized, and campus has been successful with campaigns to buy back inefficient refrigerators and freezers as well as exchange older Hewlett Packard printers. According to UC Davis Policy, paper purchases and publications should have a minimum of 30 percent post-consumer waste recycled content; e-mail, electronic forms and paperless transactions are encouraged.

UC Davis is committed to fostering sustainable places that wisely steward the campus's natural resources, while creating a healthy, enriching physical environment for learning and discovery. That commitment includes the outdoor campus landscape, gateways to the Davis community and a network of natural reserves elsewhere in California that UC Davis manages. UC Davis has automated and centralized its landscape irrigation control to meet the demands of campus weather. Computerized central controls have trans­formed campus water conservation, saving an estimated 49 million gallons of water per year, almost one-third of total utility water used on campus.",http://sustainability.ucdavis.edu/progress/buildings/index.html,The various guidelines and policies related to sustainable maintenance and operation of UC Davis facilities have been adopted over a period of time.

This approach to building operations and maintenance was adopted campus-wide in 2013 through the Sustainable Building Operations & Maintenance Program. This program has set goals to conserve water and energy, reduce or eliminate waste, promote healthy indoor air quality, and support the purchasing of environmentally preferable materials and supplies. The following practices are being implemented in support of these goals:

1. All facilities will be managed and monitored with an emphasis on deep energy efficiency consistent with UC Policy and UC Irvine’s Energy management programs (http://www.fm.uci.edu/units/utils_energy.html). This includes the goal of exceeding UC policy of 20% reduction in energy use in all buildings through efficiency and conservation programs. Building level metering and sub-metering will be installed and monitored on all campus buildings where financially viable. 

2. All facilities will be managed and monitored with a goal of deep water efficiency consistent with UC Sustainability Policy and UC Irvine Water Action Plan (www.sustainability.uci.edu) to exceed UC Policy of 20% water savings and achieve UC Irvine’s stretch goal of 30% water savings from 2005-2007 baseline condition.  Building level water metering and sub-metering shall be installed in all facilities where financially feasible to provide detailed use data. 

3. Environmentally preferable materials, including cleaning, maintenance, and painting and coating supplies, shall be purchased and used in all building operations and maintenance to protect the health of building occupants and the surrounding environment. Products meeting Green Seal, Environmental Choice or similar approved third-party certification shall be used.    

4. All indoor pest control shall adhere to UC Irvine’s Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program (http://www.fm.uci.edu/units/pest_mgt.html) to protect the health of building occupants, the surrounding environment, and ensure that least toxic materials are applied.  

5. The indoor environmental quality of campus buildings shall be managed in conformance with EH&S Clean Air Program   http://www.policies.uci.edu/adm/pols/903-10.html to ensure the health and safety of building occupants. 

In 2012 UC Irvine completed the certification of a LEED EB:OM Master Site which awarded points on a campus wide basis for Integrated Pest Management, Erosion Control, and Landscape Management Plan (SSc.3) , Site Development- Protect or Restore Open Habitat (SSc.5), Water Efficient Landscaping (WEc.3), and Green Cleaning - Indoor Integrated Pest Management (IEQc. 3.6).

Achieving LEED Silver certification in 2012, Croul Hall exemplifies sustainable building operations and maintenance at UC Irvine. Home to the Department of Earth System Science, Croul Hall features efficient plumbing fixtures, efficient landscape irrigation, energy monitoring and improved indoor air quality. Ongoing operations of the building include sustainable purchasing of ongoing consumables, durable goods, and green cleaning products as well as the implementation of green cleaning practices and solid waste management.","UC Irvine’s performance with respect to sustainable building operation and maintenance is measured against metrics established by the campus as well as those delineated in the University of California’s Sustainable Practices Policy, originally issued in July 2004 and most recently updated in June 2015. The policy establishes goals, metrics, policies, and procedures in eight areas of sustainable practices:  green building, clean energy, sustainable transportation, climate protection, sustainable operations, waste reduction and recycling, environmentally preferable purchasing, and sustainable food service. Compliance with these policies and procedures is ensured through annual tracking and reporting of adopted metrics.

Through the use of the UCSB Low Environmental Impact Cleaning Policy, it ensures that all buildings on campus are cleaned with products that meet Green Seal 37 certification, i.e., which contain low or no volatile organic compounds. To conserve water and energy, Custodial staff will use cold water for cleaning when hot water is not necessary. Manual powered equipment and cleaning strategies will be used and equipment filters will be cleaned/changed frequently, to reduce the energy and water consumption of the equipment. 
The Facilities Management Department utilizes xerophytic vegetation that is adaptive to the Santa Barbara climate and requires little or no additional irrigation beyond average rainfall. Furthermore, they use fertilizer from organic agave and measure the phosphorus runoff from the fields to maintain safe levels. The Integrated Pest Management Program deals with intrusive plants and animals through their tactics of habitat modification, exclusion, sanitation, baiting, and, monitoring. They only use pesticides when necessary for source or spot treatment outdoors. Furniture is supplied using the cradle to cradle purchasing standard. This is a method that is essentially waste free.

c. Preventative Maintenance practices improve equipment performance. Vibration analysis has just been added to our maintenance practices for critical equipment. Building filter replacement is scheduled and implemented using our CMMS system.
d. Two cooling towers were recently replaced thus improving operating performance and water usage. Sub-meters will be added to measure water usage.
e. Urinals, toilets and sinks will continue to be replaced with systems using less water.
f. Solar panels have been added to Centennial during the remodel
g. Electrical light sensors continued to be identified and added
h. Led lighting continues to be added when previous systems are scheduled for change. Example – lamp replacement at the TRW parking lot exterior fixtures.","The university develops and maintains three documents related to sustainable building operation and maintenance guidelines and policies: Campus Design Guidelines, Campus Construction Standards, and Campus Landscape Guidelines.

1.Impacts on the Surrounding Site
The campus landscape must be sustainable. On the land at UCCS, the existing vegetation is that which nature long ago decided was best suited to its elevation and micro-climate. It requires little maintenance and its continued use is evidence of good stewardship of the unique land of the UCCS campus.

2.Energy Consumption
Energy conservation must be given special consideration in the design of new or remodeled University buildings. UCCS requires a life cycle cost analysis, where appropriate, on major components of new facilities and renovation projects. 
The University is therefore dedicated to the principle of conserving energy and will scrutinize proposed construction  for  means of reducing  initial  cost, as well as life cycle analysis to inform the design decision.  The Architect shall work in close cooperation with the Engineers to provide an integrated design.

3.Usage of Environmentally Preferable Materials 
Selection of exterior building materials should consider insulation value, high recycle content, low emissions, reduced job-site scrap, regional manufacturing source, sustainability, durability, reduction of energy costs, occupant comfort and aesthetic contribution.

4.Indoor Environment Quality
The benefits of improved indoor air quality, energy conservation and enhanced visual surroundings promote a healthy and productive environment for inhabitants. System Design Requirements: System selection shall consider the environmental requirements for thermal control, indoor air quality and energy use.

5.Water Consumption
Consideration of mechanical and lighting system efficiency, daylighting schemes, reduction/elimination of environmentally harmful substances, regional material availability, water conservation, and indigenous or xeric plant usage are general strategies that should be evaluated.
