Ethical Issues in a Changing World: John Morris
This course will examine some ethical themes in Western Literature and Philosophy through works such as Sophocles’ Antigone, Aristotle’s Ethics, Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, George Eliot’s Middlemarch, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, and Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway. These authors all raise important ethical questions in quite different ways. They ask not only how we should relate to one another but also reveal how ethical questions relate to our understanding of ourselves as part of an evolving world.
Tuesdays, May 6, 13, & 20 from 3:00 – 4:30 pm at the Hamilton Public Library

Active Listening: The Skill of a Lifetime: Thad Mantaro and Mark Thompson
As we become busier, and life becomes impacted by technology overload, the art of effective listening becomes more and more valuable. The difference between hearing someone and listening to someone is enormous. Effective listening skills help us to be fully present for another and to be grounded in the moment. Showing friends and family members you deeply understand not only their words but their unique life experience, can change relationships in a profound way. Active listening helps those you are communicating with feel valued and understood. In this interactive workshop participants will learn the theory behind active listening and also engage in participatory exercises and activities to practice the skill of active listening.

2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Explore both the structure and practice of community development around the world.  Engage in a critical analysis of different approaches to community development, their historical development and underlying assumptions. &nbsp;Gain an understanding of the structural and practical issues that promote or detract from the goal of community empowerment.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Outline the historical development and underlying assumptions of different approaches to community development.
•	Identify the issues faced by the rapidly changing field of community development.
•	Distill key structures and practices for becoming more effective.

Community-Based Food Systems
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: The cultivation, preparation, distribution, and consumption of food are practices that shape how we organize ourselves socially, economically, and politically. Control over food is central to the sustainability and self-determination of communities. In this seminar, you will learn about different approaches to building community-based food systems and movements for food justice around the world. Together, we will evaluate various strategies for protecting community food resources and rebuilding local food economies, as well as the factors that threaten these efforts. With special consideration for marginalized communities in the global North and South, students will develop a conceptual toolkit and set of resources to help them assess the limitations and possibilities of their own community’s food system.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Understand the historical and economic “root causes” of global hunger, peasant displacement, and environmental degradation.
•	Understand the key differences between the “dominant paradigm” of food system change and alternative models based in food sovereignty and food justice.
•	Identify concrete examples of political and practical strategies, in the global North and South, for promoting community-based food systems and evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies.
•	Support local and global movements for community-based food systems by engaging in informed activism.

Community-Based Health
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Access to health care and other resources, such as nutritious foods, employment, clean water, safe housing, education, etc. are crucial to maintaining health and well-being.  In an ideal world, everyone would have access to these essential means for survival; however, it is all too apparent this is not the case for many communities and populations around the world.  It is desirable, therefore, for those groups who are not supported by a formal health care system to seek alternative solutions for the resources they lack.  Using case studies and other readings, along with group discussion, this course will explore the global, social, political, economic, and cultural factors that contribute to poor health.  It will also look at methods for empowering communities who lack access to health care to create practical solutions that are relevant to their unique situations.  Community-Based Participatory Research will be one of the key strategies dealt with in this course due to its focus on promoting change at the grass roots level.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Identify micro and macro level factors that affect health and well-being.
•	Collaborate with communities to evaluate their needs in regard to health and cultivate ideas for appropriate actions to address those needs.
•	Provide support for community-based solutions to health issues by establishing connections to information and resources.

Community-Based Mapping
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Mapping can be a powerful tool for communities to use to better manage their resources, plan for the future, record and utilize local knowledge, raise awareness about areas of concern in their environmental and social landscape, and communicate their priorities and concerns to external agencies or government officials. This course will explore theories, ethics, applications, and methods of community-based mapping and its role in participatory learning and action as well as larger processes of integrated community-based development. This course, while drawing on many of the recent case studies, academic writings, and reports from the field, will be highly interactive and will emphasize the sharing of experiences, ideas, and insights from course participants.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Understand the basic principles, theories, and ethics of community-based mapping and its role in community-based development.
•	Identify which mapping methods and tools are most appropriate to achieve the desired objectives in your community.
•	Locate and utilize existing geographic information data sets, online and elsewhere, for specific project areas.
•	Learn some basic mapping functions (including projecting GPS coordinates onto a map, downloading and projecting satellite images, creating features from aerial imagery, and more).

Community-Based Organizing
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: The importance of an approach to community development that increases the rights of poor and marginalized people within governing structures has never been more apparent. Situations of severe oppression and marginalization demand organizing techniques that go beyond a traditional “hand-out” style approach to development. Taking a practical hands-on perspective, this course will explore the theories, tools, styles, and challenges of community-based organizing. It will discuss practical strategies for developing community leadership and working with marginalized communities. Together, we will discover the impact that ordinary individuals can have on the world.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Apply basic organizing techniques, such as popular education and direct action.
•	Understand the role of privilege, race, gender, and class in struggles for change.
•	Understand the history and basic principles of community organizing.
•	Design methods to help support and organize the local community.

Community Participation and Dispute Resolution
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Over the last three decades, community dispute resolution has become a worldwide export, embraced by many organizations throughout the world. This practice includes community mediation, facilitation, collaborative problem solving, conflict resolution, conflict transformation, and even conflict transcendence. Looking closely at these processes and practices, we will explore their social and cultural significance and applicability in various communities. We will ponder the power dynamics of disputes and their contexts and how we seek to find our own center in relation to such disputes. The course will be largely issue-focused, with an eye toward working with indigenous communities and in other sensitive cultural contexts.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Examine the nature of community dispute resolution processes and practice.
•	Reflect upon cultural assumptions about dispute resolution.
•	Explore the dynamics and contexts of power in disputes.

Community Mobilization
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Explore what turns a group of individuals into an organization or social movement.  Consider what structural, social, or psychological barriers inhibit or prevent individuals and groups from getting involved and working together for change.  Examine the definition of community mobilization as both an initial and ongoing process central to any community and social change effort with a common goal or vision that seeks to build support and participation of individuals, groups, and institutions. Learn from the theories and methods of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, whose work has guided some of the most successful development and education programs around the globe, including the Orangi Pilot Project in Pakistan, the NAAM movement in Burkina Faso, and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement in Sri Lanka, among others.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Identify the role of community mobilization in the context of human rights-based approaches to community development.
•	Outline the causes and psychological effects of poverty oppression.
•	Communicate with individuals and communities to enhance trust and solidarity.
•	Assist communities in the analysis and transformation of their world.

Development and the Politics of Empowerment
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Over the last few decades, many scholars have begun to challenge traditional conceptions of development. Their work has generated an intense debate between those that attribute “underdevelopment” to cultural factors, and those that dismiss such ideas as racially motivated and instead recognize poverty and marginalization as primarily structural and systemic issues. Indeed, the concept of poverty itself has been challenged. Employing this critical lens, the course will examine the assertion that development should not only be seen as an economic process of wealth accumulation, but rather as a socio-political process of empowerment. This realization has major implications for how NGOs approach development, as it brings to light the fact that this work has a substantial political component. In order to overcome the disadvantages of poverty, structural barriers to success must be addressed. Through a careful investigation of the historical applications of development, we will explore the idea that development is an inherently political process and challenge the claim that any development NGO is apolitical. Additionally, we will strive to identify successful methods of community empowerment through political organization.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Analyze the underlying political implications and perspectives of seemingly apolitical actions in development work.
•	Apply and refine techniques of empowerment and advocacy.
•	Explain the history of development thinking as it relates to politics.
•	Articulate a broader understanding of key terms, such as empowerment, participation, politics, and power.

Gender Equity in Development
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Women’s participation and empowerment in development is one of the major Millennium Development goals and has become an important ideal in a lot of development policy and theory. Yet there has been little dialogue as to how gender equity can actually be implemented in practice.
Women centered projects, such as microcredit and cooperatives, create new assets and enlarge the amount of available resources to communities but often do not address control of existing resources. Genuine gender equity must take into account existing relationships as well as newly developed ones.
This course will seek to understand and recognize the various forms of women’s power, potentials for disempowerment in many development initiatives, and how practitioners can facilitate gender equity in community-based sustainable development.
The course will be highly interactive and will emphasize the sharing of experiences, ideas, and insights from participants. Participants will be encouraged to test the ideas discussed by applying them to their own communities or development projects. This course will use case studies and readings to understand gender equity in development.

Upon completion of this course participants will be able to: 
•	Compare women in development vs. gender equity approaches.
•	Incorporate gender equitable methodologies into community development activities.
•	Design a gender equitable project for your community or project area.

Local Communities and Climate Change Mitigation Strategies
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description:
“The environment and the economy are really both two sides of the same coin. You cannot sustain the economy if you don’t take care of the environment because we know that the resources that we use whether it is oil, energy, land … all of these are the basis in which development happens. And development is what we say generates a good economy and puts money in our pockets. If we cannot sustain the environment, we cannot sustain ourselves.” -- Wangari Maathai 
This course provides an overview of how climate change is impacting the livelihoods of local and indigenous communities and looks at mitigation strategies proposed to combat climate change effects while promoting sustainable livelihoods. We will examine the role of science and local traditional knowledge in mitigating climate change. We will look at carbon trading, carbon offsets and REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) and PES (Payment for Environmental Services), and we will analyze the international policy context in which these solutions were born. We will critically analyze mitigation solutions and various projects, assess their local impacts, making sure we capture the community’s perspective. Our planet is heating up due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This is manifesting in different ways and all around the Earth: weather patterns are changing, desertification is expanding, sea level is rising, oceans are becoming more acid, and many species are on the brink of extinction. In an effort to mitigate climate change, economists, governments, corporations and environmentalists have proposed, since early 1990s, the use of ‘offsetting’ mechanisms to help polluting industries to compensate for their CO2 emissions by either expanding or protecting forests somewhere else. The idea of offsetting industrial carbon emissions through biological carbon sequestration and storage has been fiercely debated since it was first proposed, as well as putting a price on nature and on the “services” provided to our planet. Big conservation organizations, developed country governments and lately the private sector see these mechanisms fit to help combat climate change, whereas some NGOs, developing country governments and many local communities remain skeptical to their efficiency and even see them as dangerous and working against locals.

•	Make informed decisions when analyzing carbon offsetting/REDD projects.

Micro-Finance Projects: Sustainable Community Development and the Role of Women
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: In the context of developing communities across the world, the role of microenterprise is crucial. Identification of people who would undertake micro enterprise is the first important step. Identification of projects to fit the people and their needs and equipping people with the basic skills to run micro-enterprises profitably is the next step in the process. Women-oriented projects are vital as self-esteem building activities for women whose micro enterprises typically, in the long run, produce far reaching economic and social impact for the entire community.
Micro-enterprises have become an important vehicle of development for developing economies. They are small-scale, low-investment projects that provide fulfillment and fairly immediate income generation. This has a great impact on boosting self-confidence which in turn affects family and social life.
Micro enterprises greatly influence the women who, in developing economies, are generally uneducated or semi-educated, are dominated by men, and have relatively low societal status. Micro enterprises energize women to become economically self-sufficient, empower them to be emotionally self-confident, and enable them to have a voice in society. Their newly acquired influence reflects in improved living conditions at home and better prospects for their children’s futures.
Upon completion of this course students will be able to:
•	Explain the role and impacts of micro-finance.
•	Recognize the different types of micro-enterprises: manufacturing, agricultural and non-agricultural based industries, marketing and providing services.
•	Develop a microfinance pilot project.

Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Discover participatory methods in monitoring and evaluation for community development where multiple stakeholders are involved in the process of planning, collecting, interpreting, communicating, and using information. Gain skills in using regular monitoring and evaluation processes in order to lead to continuous improvements.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Plan a monitoring and evaluation project.
•	Develop evaluation questions that address stakeholders’ needs.
•	Select the most appropriate data collection method for a given situation.
•	Effectively communicate monitoring and evaluation data.
•	Use monitoring information for effective feedback and improvement.

Participatory Water Resource Management
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Millions in both urban and rural communities worldwide are becoming vulnerable to water scarcity, social exclusion from access to water, and polluted water sources and water-borne diseases. Overpopulation, falling groundwater tables, the mismanagement of water sources, pollution, and over-extraction all threaten to exacerbate the already severe decline in available water resources. A community-based and participatory approach involving and empowering users and managers of local communities is necessary to balance the various needs and demands on available resources. This course will explore important concepts and strategies for successful participatory water conservation strategies to ensure long-term, sustainable solutions to managing water resources effectively in communities around the world.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Work with communities using tools such as social asset mapping to identify value-based water and sanitation priorities and implement these into their community development plans.
•	Deliver training and develop capacity of local communities.
•	Understand how to integrate users and managers of local communities, government bodies, and various stakeholders into all components of effective water management plans.

Social Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: One of the biggest challenges we face in today’s global economy is the alleviation and ultimate elimination, of poverty. Unemployment, lack of economic opportunities and the inability to provide for one’s needs and those of one’s family, lead to destructive consequences at the individual level and can lead to crime and armed conflict at the social level. While the latest development theory recognizes the importance of entrepreneurship and micro-enterprise generation in combating poverty, providing employment and increasing income, in order to address poverty at the grass-roots level, we need to explore the intersection of traditional business concepts with social venturing. This course aims to provide an understanding of social entrepreneurship that will help us put theory into practice in a meaningful way.
This course will examine entrepreneurship and enterprise generation as a key foundation of the development of both economic and social capital, as well as individual and community empowerment. Its main emphasis will be the exploration of entrepreneurship with an imperative to drive social change and build sustainable ventures. Its focus will be on designing enterprises for the base of the economic pyramid in the context of disadvantaged communities. We will participate in the unfolding dialogue about what constitutes a “social entrepreneur”, develop an understanding of the power of “disruptive innovation”, and study success stories from around the world, thereby gaining valuable insights into how to develop our own enterprises.
This course will require critical thinking, be highly interactive, and students will share their experiences, ideas, insights and challenges. Participants will be able to apply the learning from this course to their own start-ups and field projects.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Understand the role of enterprise development in poverty reduction.
•	Identify key elements to designing a successful social venture.
•	Analyze social entrepreneurship in the context of developing sustainable businesses.
•	Network with resource organizations for social enterprise development projects.

Technology and Community Development
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Explore how technology, both a blessing and curse, is critical for individuals and communities accessing and managing resources. Consider equitable distribution of technology and its productive gains, environmental impacts, debt burdens, health consequences, and impacts on the social and cultural fabric of a community.  Examine some of the practical and ethical challenges faced by communities and community workers in their efforts to develop or introduce new technologies to enhance human well-being. Discover important concepts and strategies for successful participatory technology development, emphasizing principles developed by thinkers such as Ghandi and E.F. Schumacker.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Outline the history and basic principles of appropriate technology.
•	Work with communities to analyze their situation, develop strategic directions, and generate appropriate technology packages.
•	Support community-based technology generation efforts by creating linkages to information and resources.

Tourism and Development
2 CEUs
Duration: 5 Weeks
Description: Globally, tourism initiatives receive considerable public funding and private investment as a means of economically developing low-income communities. NGOs are taking on a growing role in local tourism initiatives, as well as voluntourism, in hopes of injecting capital into the communities where they work. Amongst proponents, tourism is seen as a mechanism for local communities to capitalize on assets such as the natural environment and cultural heritage. Yet critiques often note that tourism can be destructive, elite and at times oppressive. In light of this critical lens, we will explore both successful and problematic tourism initiatives. We will critically examine the nature of tourism, its impacts on communities and considerations that must be taken into account in order for a tourism project to have the desired impact of development without destroying.
Upon completion of this course participants will be able to:
•	Identify best practices for successful tourism initiatives.
•	Work with a community to evaluate how tourism may impact their lives.
•	Network with private, public and non-profit institutions in the field of tourism and development.
•	Understand common challenges and issues with eco-tourism and voluntourism.

THE WORLD TODAY
This course is for those who are interested in current events. Each week we discuss news from the United States, the world, and the Triangle. We begin each class with a list of proposed topics and discuss those
of interest to the group. Class members also offer topics for discussion.
Active participation by class members is encouraged (but not mandatory), as it expands our mutual
understanding of the many events that might affect us. Discussions are enriched by the variety of backgrounds,
expertise, and viewpoints of class members. Topics are discussed knowledgeably, respectfully, and sometimes
with passion, but we always end with humor, looking forward to the next class. We offer two sections of this class. The discussion leaders will rotate between the two sections. While not necessarily experts in the field, each has participated in “The World Today” discussions many times; each brings a distinctive style and background to the class, and most important, each will elicit a wide spectrum of views from class members.

ENERGY UPDATE:
Our National Addiction Continues
We have become a nation of energy addicts. Without electricity at the flick of a switch and gasoline at the
pump, our comfortable world would collapse into a miserable struggle for subsistence. Is that overly dramatic?
Think about it. In this course, we will discuss how we reached this state of dependency over the past
couple of centuries and what is being done to prepare for the day when we begin to run short of the ancient—
and nonrenewable—reserves of fossil fuels that provide most of today’s energy and contribute to major
environmental problems. We will mix a bit of history with a dash of technology, add some simple economics,
and, of course, throw some politics into the stew. By the end of the course we should know enough to try
to understand whether the United States has a rational energy policy.

CURRENT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES—2014
This course will explore public policy issues that are currently areas of contention between conservative,
liberal, and other groups. We will begin with forty minutes of presentations followed by fifty minutes of
class questioning and discussion. Among the topics will be the following:
•	l K-through-12 education—what is the best way to educate our children?
•	l workforce training—preparation for employment
•	l fiscal policy—growth, deficits, and taxation
•	l monetary policy—the Fed, inflation, and asset bubbles
•	l foreign policy and defense—vital national interests and defense of the homeland
•	l healthcare—optimizing quality and access
•	entitlements—Social Security and Medicare nonmeans tested programs going broke
•	l immigration—by ability and skills or uniting families and refugees
•	l energy policy—cheap energy to grow economy or expensive energy to reduce pollution
•	l federal regulations—rationale for costly market interference (OSHA, EPA, FCC, FDA, etc.)
•	l elections—the new law explained

THOMAS BERRY’S
DREAM OF THE EARTH:
Foundations of an Ecological Civilization Thomas Berry, formerly of Greensboro, is the leading
thinker in human ecology of our time. 2014 is the 5th anniversary of his death and the 100th anniversary
of his birth. The Dream of the Earth, his landmark book, has sold over 100,000 copies. First published in 1988,
it is still regarded as the key source for his thought. Berry taught that the universe expresses itself as a
succession of dream experiences and that humans are part of the dream of the Earth. The question, then, is
not what do we want Earth to be, but what does Earth want us to be? Drawing on the wisdom of Western
philosophy, Asian thought, and Native American traditions, as well as contemporary physics and
evolutionary biology, Berry recasts our understanding of science, technology, politics, religion, ecology, and
education. In this course, we will explore Berry’s ideas and how he speaks to us today.

NATIVE AMERICAN VIEWS OF LAND:
Space and Place as Sacred
Almost all of the Native American tribes have a traditional concept of land as a mother held in sacred
esteem. This course will explore how space and place are central to different tribes’ spiritual philosophies
and practices, as well as how animals and plants fit into their sacred ecology. These views will be contrasted
to those of European colonizers who viewed land as property and nature as resource. We will examine how
conflicting views played out historically, from Europeans’ “legal” justifications to appropriate native land in
early colonization to the nineteenth-century Allotment Act’s attempt to teach Indian people the concept of
“private property.” We will also look at how these conflicting views are evident in contemporary land
and resource issues affecting American Indians. Throughout the course, we will bracket the deeper
question of what these indigenous traditional sacred ecologies might teach mainstream America about the
environmental issues facing us today.

ENERGY & THE ENVIRONMENT:
Exploring Paths toward a Cleaner Future
To frack or not to frack? Is clean coal an oxymoron? Nuclear energy—a cleaner choice or a catastrophe
waiting to happen? These are central questions to the great energy debate that rages in our country. In this
course, we’ll study the historical and economic events that frame the current energy debate. We’ll learn about
the scientific basis for the most controversial forms of energy generation, and we’ll examine the environmental
impacts of these processes with a special focus on North Carolina. The end goal is to become informed
citizens so we can participate in the debate with full k [TRUNCATED]",True,"The Sustainable Community Development program offers online, noncredit courses designed for people who currently work in community development and desire to advance their careers as well as those who plan to work or volunteer in this field.

The program examined the role of planning in federal land management. Each of the principal federal land management agencies is required to engage in planning under its organic statute. The agencies also must conduct planning to comply with requirements under cross-cutting environmental and natural resource management laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. It explored how successfully the federal land management agencies and other agencies whose missions include protecting federal lands and resources have incorporated long-term planning practices into their resource management strategies and whether Congress’s vision of a management regime based on planning has improved protection and use of federal lands and resources. It also identified opportunities for improvement and innovation in current planning practices.

On September 19, 2014 the Law School held a program on ""The Role of Adaptive Management in Addressing Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making.""  A description of the program follows:

The purpose of the workshop was twofold.  First, Professors J.B.

They will present their ideas and seek the responses of the workshop participants.  Second, the workshop will provide an opportunity for participating government personnel in to share the latest thinking and developments in adaptive management in a roundtable format.  These sessions will provide a unique opportunity for the participants to understand how agencies are using adaptive management tools, the challenges being faced in utilizing adaptive approaches, and to share ideas about how to address these challenges.

On October 23, 2014 the Law School held a program on ""Submarine Cables in the Sargasso Sea.""  A description of the program follows:

The objective of the workshop is to start an informed dialogue between the Submarine Cable Industry and the newly established Sargasso Sea Commission regarding best environmental practices for the laying and maintenance of cables in high seas areas, such as the Sargasso Sea. The intended outcomes are a published report of the Proceedings and an Agreed Statement of ""Best Practices"" that might form the basis of an MOU.",--,,--,--,"(1) Our numerical response is specific to the Law School.

A Tibetan Renaissance: The Role of Dalai Lamas & the Tibetan Intellectuals
The 17th and the 18th centuries in Tibet marked the beginning of a Tibetan Renaissance movement that left a lasting imprint on the culture and society of Tibet. Tibet in this period witnessed a sudden leap in printing, production of knowledge, painting, and poetry. We will explore the works of major literary figures of this period including: the Fifth Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (aka ""the Great Fifth,""1617-1682), Dokhar Tsering Wangyal (1697-1763), Situ Choekyi Jungney (aka Situ Panchen; 1700-1774), and Doring Pandita (1721-1792).

The Power of Words-and Pictures: Exploring the Graphic Novel
Join us as we explore the graphic novel format as a medium for transmission of important historical, cultural, and human experiences. Our conversation begins on September 10, with award-winning graphic novelist and Bloomington resident Nate Powell, who will share how he approaches a project, with a special focus on his work on the March trilogy with civil rights icon, John Lewis, and co-creator Andrew Aydin. He will share how he conducts research and works with the historical record and translates them into the compelling graphic images that have been hailed by critics for creating ""an astonishingly accomplished graphic memoir that brings to life a vivid portrait of the civil rights era, Lewis' extraordinary history and accomplishments, and the movement he helped lead... its power, accessibility and artistry destine it for awards, and a well-deserved place at the pinnacle of the comics canon."" In the second session, the MCPL's community engagement manager and long-time reader and student of comic books, Josh Wolf, will help us gain a broader understanding of the graphic novel format, as he places Nate Powell's illustrations and the March trilogy in the long tradition of visual storytelling that began with cave paintings and continues through digital media.

Noon at Noodles on the East Side
Features three diverse topics, two of which are:
Severe Weather: What Is It and What Can We Do About It?
Weather disasters costing at least $1 billion impact the United States five to six times each year. Worldwide, that number is over two dozen events annually. Why are these events so costly? Can we do anything to lessen their impacts? In this class, we will discuss some of the types of severe weather that produce major disasters-hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and wildfires. Topics will include the science that causes these phenomena, how they move, how they produce damage, and how we can anticipate and prepare for them. We will also explore the tools that scientists use to monitor and track these disasters-including weather radar and satellite; among others.
Food, Sex, and Gender
A headline asks ""Is Food the New Sex?"" Marketers decide to sell bottled water with pink labels for women and blue labels for men. An artist carves a nude male torso out of butter and then lets it melt in the sun. What is going on here? Why is food such a deeply moral and political issue in so many cultures? This lecture will explore the way food is used to reflect and create gender and to promote (or inhibit) and express sexuality.

Lake Monroe Revealed!
The next time you drive across the Lake Monroe causeway on Highway 446, you might be surprised to learn that there is a lot more to the story than a scenic view. Join us for a boat ride on Lake Monroe this fall and learn about Indiana's largest lake, how it is a flood savior, it's value as Bloomington's water source, and is one of the few places for water-based recreation in southern Indiana. And guess what? Lake Monroe was not built by nature. Originally home to the Delaware and Miami tribes, followed by early settlers and farmers, the lake eventually flooded homes, roads, cemeteries, even whole towns. Why did this happen, how does it work, and what are the downsides of an engineering endeavor of this magnitude? Join us for a great day of learning on the lake!

Habitats of Southern Indiana and Their Inhabitants
This course, for interested nonexperts, will review the major habitat types of southern Indiana, changes in plant and animal communities wrought by indigenous peoples and by European colonization, and stresses that presently affect both habitats and inhabitants. We will have a lecture-discussion Wednesday evening followed by a field trip the following Saturday to Sycamore Land Trust's Beanblossom Bottoms Nature Preserve and the surrounding area, located in northern Monroe County. The field trip will involve gentle walking over flat land and boardwalks totaling approximately 2 miles, with frequent stops and occasional opportunities to sit.

Penn State Extension in the College of Agricultural Sciences offers a variety of non-credit educational opportunities in the areas of agriculture, natural resources, food and health, and youth and family.

A small number of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been developed by Penn State faculty thus far.  One of these - entitled ""Energy, the Environment, and our Future"", taught by Geosciences professor Richard Alley - has a strong sustainability theme.  

There are a number of other centers and programs at Penn State with an educational focus that offer sustainability-related education that is not for academic credit.  For example:
The GridSTAR Center (Grid Smart Training and Application Resource Center) and the Northern Mid-Atlantic Solar Education and Resource Center deliver professional and skilled workforce educational programming in the areas of smart grid and solar technologies, respectively.

In this course, Instructor Alison Henning, Ph.D., will examine some of the major changes in our planet’s climate and their effect on the Earth’s physical and biological development, including the life of its many species and human society. While global warming has been big news in recent years, patterns of warming and cooling have played significant roles in the lives of Earth’s inhabitants for billions of years. 

(3) Sustainable Landscaping (Spring): 
Sustainability is defined as the capacity to endure.  In a biological sense it means that an ecosystem has diversity of species and is dynamic, productive and long lived.  A historically thriving, healthy forest is an example of a sustainable ecosystem.  The ocean is another prime example.  In this course, participants will learn and apply the principles of this natural process coupled with key concepts from organic gardening, permaculture and natural landscaping to explore the potential of long-term maintenance and well-being of our yards, gardens and lives.  

Includes Sustainability: 
(1) Your Dream Home: A Guide to the Design, Building and Remodeling Process (Fall/Spring): 
A homeowner considering building a new home or undertaking a remodeling project faces a daunting number of decisions, from establishing a budget to selecting interior finishes.  In this guide to design, new construction and remodeling, registered architect and interior designer Brent Nyquist will lead you through the process.  You will acquire the tools necessary to manage your project successfully and to assess the role, value and quality of the professionals involved.  You will also learn about new concepts in design and home building as well as practical solutions that will define living in the 21st century, including green design and construction, and the components required to create a healthful and energy-efficient home environment. 

(2) Spotlight on Rice University’s Kinder Institute for Urban Research (Spring):
More than thirty years ago, the Houston Area Survey began as an undergraduate research course conducted in Rice University’s sociology department.  Originally designed simply to measure the experiences, attitudes and demographic trends of the city and its residents, the survey has since grown not only to measure but also to interact with the city in numerous ways to help make it a better place to live and work.  In 2012 the Kinder Institute for Urban Research was established to further this growth.  Today the institute conducts scientific research, sponsors educational programs, and engages in public outreach that advances understanding of pressing urban issues and fosters the development of more humane and sustainable cities.  In this course, members of the research faculty at the institute will discuss this organization’s various programs and accomplishments.  This course will culminate in a presentation of the central findings from the new 2014 Kinder Institute Houston Area Survey by its founder and co-director of the institute, Dr. Stephen Klineberg.

2.	Drawing a Line in the Tar Sands

In 2012, President Obama’s administration delayed a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, a $7 billion conduit that would carry tars and oil from Canada to the gulf ports of Texas. The President stated that he would approve the 1,200-mile pipeline from Morgan, Montana to Steele City, Nebraska if it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, the State Department released its long-awaited Environmental Impact Statement on the pipeline to Secretary Kerry, who will review it before he advises the President. What are the political, economic, and environmental effects of the pipeline? Will it provide jobs, energy independence, cheaper and more secure energy? Or will the pipeline usher in a climate change Armageddon? If passed, will civil disobedience take center stage? A line in the sand has been drawn by both sides.

Religions are commonly viewed as ways to transcend nature, not abide in it. Religious people often describe themselves as pilgrims ""just a-passin' through"" rather than at home on the earth. Yet the current environmental crisis has motivated many people to re-examine their traditions and to align themselves with the earth. Whether Buddhist or Christian, Jew or Hindu, they discover a religiously-based eco-theology, an ethic of earth-care, a means of re-inhabitation, and rituals of sustainability—in short, an eco-spirituality.
A dialogue about the fate of the earth has begun. We will enter a discussion with Christians, Buddhists, Native Americans, Taoists, Jews, Hindus, and Muslims, as well as with new voices of eco-feminism, deep ecology and sustainable design. Emphasis will be placed on what people and communities practice, and on new forms of Christian theology, and on the design of a sustainable future. This class is discussion oriented with readings and reflection papers. We will talk to each other through a discussion forum, post our papers for our peers' responses, and take advantage of relevant websites.

Global Human Rights (MLS 620—Online)
The setting of this course is a grassroots, intensely focused, and highly respected human rights organization. MALS students will join the organization as trainees to become human rights monitors (investigators). The highly interactive training program will require new monitors to learn by exploring human rights issues around the world. The research requires virtual travel to sites of current conflict to investigate allegations of genocide in Darfur, sex slavery in Thailand, detainee abuse in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, and growing threats to civil liberties.
Students will develop critical familiarity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its historical antecedents in the U.S. Bill of Rights and the French Rights of Man, and explore their cultural and political foundations. Most required readings will be available online, but students will be expected to view documentaries and films as well as read additional materials that inform their human rights research.
Students will become proficient in research methodologies that encourage investigative independence and creativity while maintaining academic rigor in order to understand complex issues and recommend achievable solutions in their reports to the agency director.


Livable and Sustainable Cities (MLS 620—Online)
This course asks students to learn a language composed of interlocking patterns that connect the people and buildings of a city with their history and natural ecology. We begin with an overview of the historical and social roots of the problem in James Kunstler's Geography of Nowhere: The Rise and Decline of America's Man-made Landscapes. Christopher Alexander's A Pattern Language, the main text of the course, provides us with a catalog of 100 urban patterns with which we can analyze any city landscape and design a better one. With this new language, each student conducts a study of what works well in their neighborhood and city. After several weeks a clear picture of the problems and possibilities of each urban space will become evident. 
We will add to our pattern recognition by incorporating the latest thinking of the leading theorist of sustainable places, William McDonough, in Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. He shows how to effectively integrate the economic necessities of life with the surrounding environment. Finally, we conclude with a study of patterns of sustainability in Timothy Beatley's The Ecology of Place: Planning for Environment, Economy and Community. Students choose their own patterns that enhance a community's sustainability and apply them to a particular case study in their own community.

Sustainable Life on a Tuscan Farm (MLS 620—Online)
This course begins in North Carolina, actually, online. Before we visit the farm, we will read and discuss online four books about Italian culture and agriculture. After our week together, each student presents online a paper about one of the facets of the farm or rural life and culture that they found most fascinating. Ten weeks in all, September 10- November 20.
During our week in Italy, October 8-15, 2012, we will study diverse food production processes, learn the history of Italian farming and the architecture of rural buildings, study the current issues faced by the Italian farmer, and have opportunity to explore and enjoy the hill towns and cultural life in the Sienese region of Tuscany. Italians will introduce us to their language and customs, guide us through tastings of food—olive oil, cheese, wine, and prosciutto, conduct a cooking class of home-grown food, and show us the farm. Each evening we will enjoy a four-course farm meal in the company of staff and guests.

The Global Economy (MLS 620—Online)
For the past decade or so, ""globalization"" has been the media buzzword used to describe changes in the U.S. and world economies, perhaps second in recent years only to ""the New Economy"" in frequency of use. For the most part, this discussion of globalization has focused on changes that seem apparent in contrast to the period following WWII. According to one popular version of this story, in the 1970s the barriers to cross-border trade and financial transactions began to come down. By the late 1990s, as one commentator put it, we lived on the cusp of a ""borderless world"" where people, information, equipment and ideas would flow freely. In this context, it was imagined; the world would prosper as never before.
During the post-war period, global cross-border trade and financial transactions were a fraction of what they are today. For many developed countries, the increased trade of the past few decades has meant a decline in the importance of manufacturing, as production of everything from cars to shoes has moved to places where labor was relatively cheap. For a few developing countries, this has meant increased investment from rich developed nations. But for many—especially countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, to say nothing of the ex-manufacturing sectors of the developed world—so called ""globalization"" has bought few, if any, of the beneficial effects once imagined. Or so it would seem.
This course begins where the theory of the global economy and its reality meet. In general, the course highlights the theory of free trade, since it is on the back of this theory that the promise of globalization—or we might say, economic liberalization—rests. As we will see, the most recent episode of economic liberalization is but a small part of the whole story, although our recent experiences can tell us a good deal about how free trade might or might not work, and for whose benefit. The course is divided into eight basic units, each exploring an important topic for understanding the global economy. 


Global Perspectives in Biology (MLS 630—Online)
Biology affects us on a global scale. It touches our lives every day, and understanding biological principles and concepts is vital for all citizens of the 21st century. In this course, you think and learn about some of the smallest organisms on the planet: bacteria and viruses that cause human diseases. Diseases caused by microbes have had an enormous impact on human health throughout history, and they continue to challenge us today. Although the Germ Theory of Disease was recognized in the 19th century and antibiotics were discovered in the 20th, we have not been able to eliminate the worldwide scourge of infectious diseases, especially in developing countries. In this course, we focus on several diseases caused by bacteria or viruses, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, influenza, and cholera. These diseases become models for understanding basic biological principles. In addition, we'll learn about their global consequences (past and present) and about the approaches used today to try to control infectious diseases.",True,"The goal of the Certificate in Global Studies program is to increase knowledge of world cultures as well as economic, environmental, and social issues. This post-baccalaureate Certificate is earned by taking a minimum of 5 courses through the Graduate Liberal Studies program. Students in the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program may also enroll in this certificate program.

The certificate program seeks to instill a knowledge of particular cultures, while also providing training in the analysis of global trends. It is designed for college graduates interested in developing an understanding of global issues. Students will learn how to make connections between their particular part of the world and the larger trends and issues that affect all societies. 

Coursework for the certificate program consists of 15 hours of interdisciplinary online courses. Students must take 9 hours of required courses and 6 hours of approved electives. The Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program requires that students take at least one course in the three traditional liberal arts areas – the humanities (MLS 610), the social sciences (MLS 620), and the sciences (MLS 630). Likewise, the certificate includes the same requirement. The aim is to approach a culture, geographical area, or global issue by reaching across disciplinary boundaries rather than focusing exclusively in one area or discipline. Students have three years to complete the certificate.",2008.0,http://mals.uncg.edu/program/options.php,"Information for this was received in part from Julee Johnson, Advisor for Graduate Liberal Studies at UNCG.

This series of five classes will teach you to work with nature to make your landscape a model of sustainability. Teachings based on the principles of SITES™, the Sustainable Sites Initiative™.

Art in Nature
The Wildflower Center is the perfect backdrop for the new Art in Nature series. Brilliant displays of flowering native plants, vibrant water features teeming with fish and turtles, and flitting butterflies and acrobatic hummingbirds make capturing the beauty and wonder of the natural world easy for budding artists. This nature based art series is geared towards those interested in learning the foundations of photography, watercolors, floral silk painting, ink painting, and botanical illustration.

Most classes can be taken individually, without pursuing the certificate.
