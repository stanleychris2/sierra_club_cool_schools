NC4760	Excess in America:  A Crisis of Common Sense and Self Discipline	Excess Materialism – Excess Government – Excess Waste – Excess Spending – Excess Consumption – Excess Debt – Excess Body Weight – Excess Political Posturing – Excess Commercial Real Estate – Excess Residential Real Estate – Excess Environmental Contamination – Excess Litigation – White Collar Greed – Political and Corporate Narcissism – Excess Exported Manufacturing – Excess Foreign Oil Dependence – The Deindustrialization of America – Excess Media – Excess Trivia – Excess Petroleum Cost – Excess Entitlement – Excess Medical . . . Excess in America: Is there any doubt?  
NC4761	Capitalism and Social Justice	For as long as commercial society has existed, there has been tension between an economy’s ability simultaneously to satisfy private wants and provide for public needs. This class will examine great debates of the past and apply them to the current political tensions between left-wing progressives and right-wing conservatives. We will explore questions such as, “How does capitalism benefit the poor?” “Should markets have moral limits?” “Are markets the best means to achieve the public good?” “To what extent should economic liberty be constrained?”
NC4779	Birds of South Florida	Every year hundreds of millions of birds visit or travel through and over Florida. Some are permanent residents.  Many only winter here; others are here only for the summer when they nest, while most stop to rest and eat on their exhausting inter-continental journeys. Join in the enthusiasm and enjoy the slides of dozens of these beautiful, amazing, fascinating neighbors and visitors hosted by a life-long bird watcher. 
AT4793	Folly of the Crowds	""I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people,” said Isaac Newton after losing most of his money. Real estate bubbles, Wall St. con games and Ponzi schemes are nothing new. Learn about South Seas Co., tulips, relics and other extraordinary mass obsessions through history.  
NC4814	Marriage Equality In America: Has the Time Finally Come and Are We Ready?	“Marriage Equality” and same-sex marriage. Mr. Goldstein will review the recent Supreme Court marriage equality cases, and will discuss the rapidly changing world of marriage equality, focusing on what is happening in the courts, the state legislatures and at the voting booth.   
NC4825	American Presidents: 1776 – 1929	Congress had no power to tax as the Revolutionary War wore on. So desperate was the situation that George Washington went out of pocket to pay his troops.  One hundred fifty years later, after a half dozen or so significant economic booms and busts, Herbert Hoover was faced with a financial collapse of almost Biblical proportions. Some said this was proof of the failure of capitalism and by extension the American way of life.  We’ll explore the surprisingly similar causes of the Panics of the 19th century and how they affected the sitting President and the country; and what, if any, effort was made to prevent them in the future, and if the root causes still exist today.
NC4826	American Presidents: 1930 – Today	Despite President Hoover’s best efforts, President Roosevelt inherited in 1933 an economic collapse that only got worse as continuing bank failures and mounting unemployment sank the nation to new depths.  Unprecedented governmental action, World War II, and a revival of the natural business cycle saw prosperity return. The rest of the century saw its share of boom and bust, but nothing close to the depressed times of the 1930s, that is until the so-called Great Recession of today. What comparisons can be made between these economic events and the reactions of the various Presidents in office at the time?

Learn the tricks and tips to make photos that you’ll be proud to show! This class is specially geared towards capturing the flora and fauna of Southwest Florida. 
AT4840	Positive Quotations	In this modern world of tweets and instagrams and spur of the moment comments, quickly read and easily deleted, wouldn't it be great to actually sit down and discuss some of the most meaningful quotations from great leaders, renown legends, politicians, and spiritual leaders; quotations which have changed people's lives and still give food for thought?

NC4891	The Healthcare and Social Systems of China	The healthcare and social security systems of China are woefully misunderstood in the west. China has a long way to go with improving these systems, and the road is going to be costly.  Is it possible that the future cost of these programs will bring down the government of China? What can the rest of the world learn from the Chinese approach?  Let’s examine multiple-level system of healthcare and social security safety nets and learn of the hardships and costs imposed on the Chinese people. 
HC0677	Tai Chi: “Meditation in Motion” for Better Health 	The gentle, flowing movements of Tai Chi promote better health, leg strength, and an overall feeling of well-being, according to the Mayo Clinic.

HC0647	Florida's Literary Heritage	Five landmark books frame the study of the cultural heritage and history of Southwest Florida, and the writers who found creative inspiration in their cracker surroundings. Works span more than 75 years, beginning with M. Stoneman Douglas' River of Grass (1930), and including Peter Matthiessen’s Killing Mr. Watson (1990) as the class discusses the area's unique sensitivities to its biodiversity, demographics, ecology and development. The instructor provides insights about literary symbolism, plot development, irony, and dialog, historic perspective and narrative style. Readers are encouraged to take independent field trips to each book's setting. Students procure their own books. The class meets every other Thursday for six weeks.
HC0614	Less About Me, More About We	This study seeks to answer those who claim that liberalism is immoral and destroying the values of this country. It does so in a manner and language that provides understanding and meaning to the religious and non-religious. Using the perspective that its 'less about me and more about we,' it seeks to provide careful and reasoned responses in specifically Judeo-Christian context, to many of the most vocalized and divisive current issues: patriotism, war, abortion, 'war' on women, homosexuality, poverty and the environment.

NC4596	Public Art and Rites of Passage	Penny Balkin Bach will examine three very different works of public art (from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries) through the lens of Arnold van Gennep’s anthropological view of the stages of rites of passage.  Philadelphia's “Museum Without Walls” is one of the nation's largest collections of outdoor sculpture, which parallels the history of American art. Bach's experience with this historic collection, as well as her work with contemporary artists, has shaped her particular view of this continuum of innovation, creation, controversy, and incorporation. She will also talk about recent work that invites the public to stop, look, listen, and experience public art in entirely new ways through interactive programs and technology.  
SP5057	Rookery Bay Boat Tour	Learn about the importance of estuaries and the activities of Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.  The trip includes a slide presentation, a boat trip trawling at the Reserve examining the critters that live in the bay, and, if time allows, an easy walk across Key Island to the beach.

Chris Desmond and members of his team for this film/lecture presentation. 
NC5094	Orchids, Bromeliads, Succulents, Oh My!	Learn how to select beautiful plants that can thrive on Southwest Florida's natural precipitation.  The variety of plants will surprise you.  Expand your plant palette to include an array of the easiest plants to care for in your garden. 
AT5096	Gardening in Small Places	Southwest Florida has many challenges when gardening within courtyards, patios, and lanais.  Making the correct plant choices is crucial due to sunlight, air circulation, pests, and plant hardiness.  An emphasis will be given to orchids, bromeliads, and succulents that have proven to be the most beautiful, lasting, and carefree.
NC5099	Butterflies, Hummingbirds, and Blooms	By adding a few colorful flowering plants to your current landscape you can create a breeding ground and inviting habitat for as many as a dozen types of beautiful butterflies.

The course will focus on sub-Sahara Africa and primarily within Africa's precolonial past.  
NC5354	Nature and Wildlife Photography 	There is probably no more challenging a subject for cameras than wildlife. Whether it is polar bears or pelicans, orchids or orcas, the quest for the perfect shot is endless. The quarry is invariably erratic, endangered and elusive. However, the pursuit of this precious image is what makes it such fun, so rewarding. Learn the tricks and tips to make photos that you’ll be proud to show! This class is specially geared towards capturing the flora and fauna of Southwest Florida.
NC5426	The Global Energy Revolution	For decades we have been dependent on energy imports because we thought our own stocks were running out. But then we suddenly discovered fracking even though it has been around since 1947.  Now, in a few years we will likely be energy independent with large energy exports.  But is fracking a menace to the environment? If we can frack why can't Europe and China? Do we still have to be nice to the Arab states that supplied our energy? Can we step away from the growing chaos of the Middle East.  Can we pull up the drawbridges we ourselves built to the entire outside world? Can we, should we, focus only on our own big problems of crumbling infrastucture, unfair wealth distribution, expensive health care and more?  The rest of the world is an awfully messy place. Why not just forget it? 
NC5428	Yes, We Can End Poverty.  Everywhere. Almost	Globally one billion people have risen out of poverty in the last quarter-century. Will the remaining one billion come out of poverty in the next quarter-century?  Why does any poverty remain in an extraordinarily rich country like America?  What can we do about it?  What should we do? 
HC0584	""Who's Afraid of the Much-Maligned Snake?""	Why do snakes have such a bad reputation in the western world?  Why do so many of us feel repelled and frightened by them? And why do so many eastern cultures have a different perspective? Snakes play an important role in legends, fairytales, and most importantly, differing religious meanings in our western and eastern cultures. 
HC0587	The Advantages of Forgiveness	In 1995, investment banker Azim Kamisa's only son Tariq, a student at San Diego State University, was shot and killed by a 14-year-old gang member as he was delivering pizzas for a part-time job. Since then, Kamisa has eased his own pain by extending forgiveness to the killer and working with youth at risk. Could you do this? Could I? Or are some acts so horrific that no forgiveness is possible? This lecture explores such questions, including the emotional and even physical benefits of forgiving others as we would hope they would forgive us.

3.Corporate Social Responsibility-Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the concept of organizations taking responsibility for their impact on society and the environment. Businesses which embrace CSR promote the public interest through what they do (for example, encouraging community growth and development) and what they refrain from doing (for example, eliminating or avoiding practices that harm stakeholders, regardless of whether such practices are legal). CSR is the inclusion of the public interest into corporate decision-making.

After completing this module, the student should be able to:

     Define corporate social responsibility (CSR) and explain how the concept has been         broadened

5.Sustainable Management: Leadership Ethics-Leaders are increasingly being held responsible and accountable for the manner in which they lead--and if they are adhering to ethical behavior when they make decisions. Organizations have learned that the costs of unethical actions can be high, both legally, and from the perspective of brand image and reputation.

At the same time, research is showing that good business ethics translates to good business results. Leading in an ethical manner can provide a clear advantage in building a thriving enterprise.

6.Taking the Helm at Coastal Industries Simulation-
Throughout this simulation, you will play the role of the new chief executive officer of Coastal Industries, a fictional manufacturer of industrial transformers. During the simulation, you will be asked to make a series of decisions as Coastal Industries adopts sustainable management practices. These decisions will involve the company's operations, its standing in the community, and its relations with local government and state and federal regulators. Each of your decisions will affect Coastal Industries in different ways. Your goal in the simulation is to optimize positive scores across the following leadership factors:

You will be asked to make a series of decisions during the simulation, and each decision will impact the project in different ways. Your goal in the simulation is to optimize positive scores across the following project management factors:

    Managing organizational change
    Understanding the relationship between corporate responsibility and the community
    Assessing sustainability practices and measuring their organizational and financial impacts
    Finding compromises that meet short and long-term financial objectives

7.Triple Bottom Line Accounting-In order to pursue the goal of sustainability, corporate and government leaders must manage companies and economies in terms of balancing and optimizing the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic impacts. The Triple Bottom Line concept, also known as the ""3Ps"" (""People, Planet, and Profit""), is both a metaphor for thinking about sustainability as well as the basis for a practical framework for accounting and reporting on organizations' activities and impacts. The TBL concept borrows the well-known and widely accepted idea of financial accounting and its ""bottom line"" and expands it.

After completing this module, the student should be able to:

    Explain the triple bottom line (TBL) concept and its three pillars of ""People, Planet, and Profits""
