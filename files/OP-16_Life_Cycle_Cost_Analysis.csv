When selecting a partner for a good or service we must understand alternatives to purchase, own, operate, maintain and, finally, dispose of an object or process.

We ask our vendors and stakeholders questions to allow them to think through the whole scope of the solution.  The low cost alternative is not always in the best interest of the institution and we encourage partnership with our outside vendors to guide us through our decision making.  
Example:  During our Janitorial Services selection we broke down the long term implications of choosing a partner.  We are expanding our campus and what are the best solutions moving forward that will allow our facilities to be of the highest standards in the future.  Should we explore automated devices in our restrooms?  Should we explore alternative cleaning products that cut down on chemical usage?  Does the vendor have other solutions that would constitute a partnership in other categories?  We wanted to understand how adding square footage would affect pricing in the future.  We needed to understand how advanced in Green technology would cut down on harmful chemicals and reduce costs.  We needed to create a pricing template the would break out labor, management, and supplies over the lifetime of the contract.  By getting to the root of these questions and possible solutions, we became very educated on the total cost of the entire operation as it stand now and for the lifetime of the contract as campus expanded.

This policy reinforces the 2007 Duke Climate Action Plan. 

Extract from policy:
A/E/C Teams must demonstrate a 30% improvement over energy efficiency baseline of ASHRAE 90.1-2007, Appendix G, through the development of an accurate Whole Building Energy Simulation Model.  The choice of software is left to the modeler; however, DOE 2.x- or EnergyPlus-based systems are recommended.

The accuracy of the model is critical to prediction and budgeting for the life cycle cost of our buildings. Additionally, an accurate WBES will aid in maximizing available LEED credits, and the selected credits are meant to ensure accuracy of the model.  To encourage the effort and to ease communication, the modeler should use the attached forms for identifying modeling input and output values for Duke review.

A/E/C teams should produce early model iterations at the Design Development Phase for review with Duke Facilities Management staff (see attached for requested format).  Teams must submit a finalized model and Life Cycle Cost Analysis to FMD as part of the Construction Document package.  The WBES model results are considered integral to the 100% CD submission, and are required for FMD to sign off on construction approval.

During the construction phase of the project, all submittals are required to include an energy  and water impact statement, identifying if the proposed equipment will change building energy consumption, and if so, by what value.

Life Cycle Costing

It is the university’s policy to use the life cycle costs of goods, as developed and disseminated by the federal government, when feasible for university procurements.  

Where federal energy efficiency standards are established, life cycle costs shall be considered in the contracting for major energy-consuming goods.

In determining life cycle costs, the university may consider the cost of the good, the energy consumption, maintenance costs, the costs of upgrades over the life of the item and the projected cost of energy over the useful life of the good, and the anticipated resale or salvage value of the product.

Energy Efficiency Standards

GW shall use energy efficiency standards prescribed by Energy Star for the purchase of energy consuming goods.  Energy Star, through its website, provides a qualified list of goods meeting Energy Star’s minimum energy specifications, life cycle costing calculations, life cycle cost formula information, and qualified goods that meet Energy Star’s rating for using less energy and helping to protect the environment.  Goods listed on the Energy Star websites’ list of qualified goods will be used as “acceptable brands and models” on response documents.  The minimal energy specifications for goods listed on the Energy Star Qualified Goods list should be included in the line item specifications on all response documents for the purchase of major energy consuming goods.

The initial stages of this work were done in an Economics of the Environment class in 2013 and future stages of this will be done at least every two years.

Secondly, the College is working with its dining services contractor, Chartwells, to determine the water and carbon impacts of the dining hall.  Chartwells has developed a tool that accounts for 80% of the carbon and water impacts of the life cycle of their inputs and operation.  This information is being supplemented by LCA analyses regarding the energy costs of food to determine the impacts of the dining services.

In continuing this tradition, Stanford seeks to ensure that new and renovated buildings meet student, staff, and faculty needs as effectively and efficiently as possible.To this end, Stanford's Department of Land, Buildings and Real Estate has developed a thorough Project Delivery Process (PDP) that addresses all aspects of planning, budgeting, design and construction.

Cost effectiveness is a key component of design at Stanford, and initial project costs are the focus of many activites in the PDP. The long term cost implications of building projects, however, range far beyond initial design and construction expenses.

To improve the cost-effectiveness of its building and renovation programs, Stanford must invest in designs and systems with improved long term performance. The Guidelines for Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) instruct Project Teams to consider not only the ""first costs"" of a building but also long term costs, including utilities, operations, and maintenance.

Executive Order 88 Guidelines stipulate that life cycle cost analysis is one of the primary assessment tools used to evaluate whether a particular energy conservation measure or an energy-related capital project should be implemented.  When deciding between multiple project alternatives, the alternative with the overall lowest life cycle cost should be the one selected.  The following language is included in the Executive Order 88 Guidelines:

EO88 Guidelines Page 12: 
Although typically not required for ASHRAE Level 2 energy audits, “cost-effective” measures will be determined using Life Cycle Cost Analysis (“LCCA”). A portfolio may include, but shall not be limited to, no-cost and low-cost operational improvements, retro-commissioning, capital energy efficiency retrofits, on-site renewable and high-efficiency combined heat and power, and other measures identified by the CMIT.

1. How are ""required capital projects"" defined? (EO88 Guidelines Page 14)

Any energy efficiency measure, or combination of energy efficiency measures, which result from an energy audit, and are deemed “cost-effective” shall be considered a required capital project. State Entities shall complete, or make substantial progress toward completion, any cost-effective measures identified during an energy audit or similar study within two years of the study’s completion.  Cost-effectiveness shall be determined by a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (“LCCA”). Specific parameters for the LCCA account for:
• Initial Costs—Purchase, Acquisition, Construction Costs
• Fuel Costs
• Documented Operation, Maintenance, and Repair Costs
• Replacement Costs
• Residual Values—Resale or Salvage Values or Disposal Costs
• Finance Charges—Loan Interest Payments

Appendix D - Determining Project Cost-Effectiveness (EO88 Guidelines Page 32)
Executive Order 88 explicitly requires that buildings with low benchmark scores must undergo an ASHRAE Level 2 energy audit.  State Entities must then implement a cost-effective portfolio of measures and complete or make substantial progress toward completion of such measures within two years of the audit.1 For the purposes of EO 88, a project shall be considered cost-effective if the calculated Savings-to-Investment Ratio (“SIR”) is greater than or equal to 1.20. Additionally, when evaluating multiple, mutually exclusive alternatives, the alternative with the lowest life-cycle cost (“LCC”) is considered the most cost-effective and should be selected for installation.

Life Cycle -Cost Analysis Overview (EO88 Guidelines Page 32)
Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (“LCCA”) evaluates the costs and savings that occur from owning, operating, maintaining, replacing, and disposing of an efficiency measure over its lifetime. This method typically discounts costs and savings to reflect the time value of money. Because it accounts for all costs and savings over the full life-cycle of the measure, LCCA provides the most accurate assessment of a project’s long-term cost-effectiveness. Applying LCCA ensures that State Entities maximize savings opportunities and will ultimately help achieve the goals of EO 88.

LCCA Practices:

The Office of Campus Sustainability, Facilities Management, and other partners regularly incorporate life cycle cost analysis into day to day practice.  Energy conservation measures in the forthcoming Energy Master Plan will include life cycle cost analysis.  More and more, facilities staff are asking consultants to provide information about life cycle cost analysis of particular building features.  LCC analysis was conducted to evaluate different alternates such as controls, OA reset and other energy saving features for the chiller replacement project for McKenna Theater.  LCC analysis will be used when evaluating energy consuming products and technologies for the Engineering Innovation Hub, a new major construction project.  In the future, the Office of Campus Sustainability will incorporate LCCA when evaluating fluorescent vs. LED bulbs in new construction and major renovation projects.

The Office of Campus Sustainability is supporting Lura Speth and Kevin Saunders in their evaluation of the life cycle cost effectiveness of investing in electricity savings software for campus computers.  The extent that LCCA is used as a matter of policy and practice throughout the entire institution is unknown.",http://www.nypa.gov/BuildSmartNY/Guidelines.pdf,--

Although typically not required for ASHRAE Level 2 energy audits, “cost-effective” measures will be determined using Life Cycle Cost Analysis (“LCCA”). A portfolio may include, but shall not be limited to, no-cost and low-cost operational improvements, retro-commissioning, capital energy efficiency retrofits, on-site renewable and high-efficiency combined heat and power, and other measures identified by the CMIT.

1. How are ""required capital projects"" defined? (EO88 Guidelines Page 14)

Any energy efficiency measure, or combination of energy efficiency measures, which result from an energy audit, and are deemed “cost-effective” shall be considered a required capital project. State Entities shall complete, or make substantial progress toward completion, any cost-effective measures identified during an energy audit or similar study within two years of the study’s completion. Cost-effectiveness shall be determined by a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (“LCCA”). Specific parameters for the LCCA account for:
• Initial Costs—Purchase, Acquisition, Construction Costs
• Fuel Costs
• Documented Operation, Maintenance, and Repair Costs
• Replacement Costs
• Residual Values—Resale or Salvage Values or Disposal Costs
• Finance Charges—Loan Interest Payments

Appendix D - Determining Project Cost-Effectiveness (EO88 Guidelines Page 32)
Executive Order 88 explicitly requires that buildings with low benchmark scores must undergo an ASHRAE Level 2 energy audit. State Entities must then implement a cost-effective portfolio of measures and complete or make substantial progress toward completion of such measures within two years of the audit.1 For the purposes of EO 88, a project shall be considered cost-effective if the calculated Savings-to-Investment Ratio (“SIR”) is greater than or equal to 1.20. Additionally, when evaluating multiple, mutually exclusive alternatives, the alternative with the lowest life-cycle cost (“LCC”) is considered the most cost-effective and should be selected for installation.

Life Cycle -Cost Analysis Overview (EO88 Guidelines Page 32)
Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (“LCCA”) evaluates the costs and savings that occur from owning, operating, maintaining, replacing, and disposing of an efficiency measure over its lifetime. This method typically discounts costs and savings to reflect the time value of money. Because it accounts for all costs and savings over the full life-cycle of the measure, LCCA provides the most accurate assessment of a project’s long-term cost-effectiveness. Applying LCCA ensures that State Entities maximize savings opportunities and will ultimately help achieve the goals of EO 88.

LCCA Practices:

The Office of Campus Sustainability, Facilities Management, and other partners regularly incorporate life cycle cost analysis into day to day practice. Energy conservation measures in the forthcoming Energy Master Plan will include life cycle cost analysis. More and more, facilities staff are asking consultants to provide information about life cycle cost analysis of particular building features. LCC analysis was conducted to evaluate different alternates such as controls, OA reset and other energy saving features for the chiller replacement project for McKenna Theater. LCC analysis will be used when evaluating energy consuming products and technologies for the Engineering Innovation Hub, a new major construction project. In the future, the Office of Campus Sustainability will incorporate LCCA when evaluating fluorescent vs. LED bulbs in new construction and major renovation projects.

The Office of Campus Sustainability is supporting Lura Speth and Kevin Saunders in their evaluation of the life cycle cost effectiveness of investing in electricity savings software for campus computers. The extent that LCCA is used as a matter of policy and practice throughout the entire institution is unknown.

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is required with computer equipment, for example, are required to meet EPEAT bronze standards and they often have a higher rating. EPEAT certification includes life cycle values. TCO is sometimes evaluated in laboratory equipment, for example, such as ultra-low freezers or biological safety cabinets. In an RFP for laboratory equipment in 2011, energy efficiency and consumption values were requested for all research freezers and incubators, for example.  In 2015 and 2016, research freezers again are being evaluated under TCO which includes energy efficiency as well as potential compressor replacements.  Commercial kitchen equipment has largely been converted to energy and water conserving models, often certified by the Food Service Technology Center.

The University of California policies cover life cycle energy and water efficiency, and it applies to all campuses and medical centers, and is largely implemented through comprehensive strategic sourcing. Many RFP’s are developed at the Office of the President in Oakland, and those products and services are then available system-wide.
