The college seeks to make landscaped spaces more natural and maintenance free using native and climate suitable species. Lawns and sports fields are maintained within our organic turf management plan. A balance is met between campus aesthetics and natural management.,"Allegheny College has many trees that are older than 100 years. All efforts are made to preserve the health of these trees while thinking ahead to plant new trees to ensure we have an equally treed campus 100 years from now. Species are selected among native varieties or those best suited to the climate of our campus in order to ensure health and minimal maintenance. Landscaping around buildings is minimal and seeks to choose vegetation that is aesthetic with little to no pruning and irrigation. Carr Hall's landscaping features all native species in the outdoor landscaping. A current forestry management plan seeks to address some invasive species in wooded areas of campus, such as wild grapevine. In summer 2015, we partnered with GoNative Erie to plant dozens of native plants around campus.","Our comprehensive compost program processes all our landscape ""wastes"" and finished compost is used as a fertilizer, topsoil, and mulch component.","Allegheny has an organic turf management plan which seeks to test, balance and optimize soil fertility and organic matter; support protozoan, mycorrhizal and nematode diversity and levels; increase bacterial and fungal biomass; and balance nutrient and mineral content. In 2012, 1000 yards of compost was produced and spread on campus. In addition 200 yards of topsoil was produced and by the end of the year, 1500 yards of compost was in production. In addition, compost tea is brewed and applied to all campus grounds several times annually. Mowed lawn clipping are allowed to remain on the lawn as a mulch and source of returned fertility. ","Compost and compost tea replaces the majority of conventional chemical fertilizers. Where additional fertilizer is necessary for sports fields or areas of heavy traffic, organic fertilizers are used. Except for on sensitive sports fields, there is little emphasis on maintaining a perfectly weed free campus. Weeds are controlled mainly with the efforts to optimize soil and turf health rather than through chemical targetting of weeds. Our compost operation also provides a good source of landscaping materials such as topsoil and some mulch.","Allegheny uses a number of rain gardens to capture and infiltrate stormwater from roofs and parking areas. Several applications of permeable parking, such as Geo-Web and permeable pavers, further reduce runoff. An infiltration trench and a hillside of native wildflowers helps capture and filter runoff from another large parking lot. A green roof minimizes rooftop stormwater collection.

Trees and shrubs are usually only fertilized after a soil test has been done to prescribe the exact analysis of nutrients required. ","Landscape Services attempts to use as many native trees, shrubs, and perennials as possible. All submitted landscape plans are reviewed by the landscape services department to insure native plant material is used wherever possible. The native plants selected are the ones best suited for adaptability to the climate, watering needs as well as helping with the IPM program campus-wide.

Some wood chips are also used as a bulking agent (a carbon source) for Appalachian's in house compost operation.  The majority of grass clippings are left in place once grass is cut, which is considered 'grass-cycling'. Grass clippings will quickly decompose, returning valuable nutrients to the soil. ","The compost made by Landscape Services' Compost Division is applied to the campus landscape and gardens associated with the college. Examples: (Vanoy Farm, Edible School Yard, and The Popular Grove Daycare Garden). ","The University prefers organic compost and fertilizers, limits the use of Petrochemical fertilizers, and is eventually phasing out all organophosphate pesticides.

Durham Park creek restoration, Hill Street mitigation pond, Central Dining creek restoration, and mitigation pond installation, Varsity Gym creek restoration, and mitigation pond installation, Good Night Brothers creek restoration, Beasley Broadcasting creek restoration. These creek restorations are sections of Boone Creek which eventually flow into the North Fork of the New River. Two mitigation ponds were also formed when Greenwood lot was made. 

Restoration in 2014 includes the stabilization of the banks, formation of retention ponds, the removal of exotic invasive plants, and the planting of native plant species, along the North Fork of the New River that borders our intramural fields.  ","Snow season, in a normal year, runs from November through the following April. Snow and ice is removed as aggressively as possible, since safety is our number one goal.  We use ice melt both on the roads, sidewalks, and steps.  We use rock salt on the major roads and Snow Plow Magnesium chloride on the sidewalks and steps. In an effort to reduce the amount of snow melt materials used, and as a result, reduce the environmental impacts, ASU Landscaping Services purchased a brine spreader this year (2010).

Insecticides are very rarely used outside; when they are it is for termites. Pests are monitored and controlled through cultural methods. Susceptible plants or varieties are avoided in favor of resistant ones. Weeds are manually removed but pre-emergent’s are put down where and when appropriate before light rain to push them into the soil profile. Weeds in turf are primarily controlled with mowing and keeping the turf healthy with compost, compost teas, and fish emulsions. There is occasional spot treating for nut grass and clover.

The West campus routinely checks all turf, plant material and trees for pest. No pesticides are used on playing fields. Weeds are mechanically removed. Insects found on plant material are first removed with a water hose. If an insecticide is needed only organic based insecticides containing Bt, pyrethrums or diatomaceous earth are used. Weed control in granite and undeveloped areas are maintained only with ""Caution"" labeled pesticides. 

The Polytechnic campus action threshold is determined to only handle pest oriented situation if there is a perceived threat to human health or safety. Otherwise, wildlife is left alone. Through empirical data (observation) several species of “pests” have been identified on the Polytechnic campus that include Bees, skunks, roaches, coyotes, aphids, rattle snakes and feral cats. Any perceivable small mammal habitat is discouraged through grounds maintenance efforts of restricting access. Proper and continuous housekeeping protocol minimizes or completely reduces the need on interior spaces of the campus. 

Arizona State University has an organization that deals specifically with the feral cat population through a “Trap, Neuter and Release” program. (Friends of Feral AZ) If and only if an animal is determined to be a legitimate health or safety hazard then it is dealt with in one of two ways; trap and release in the case of all mammals and occasionally bee swarms, and in the case of most other insects lethal means are used by way of calling in a pest management professional.

Insecticides are rarely used as part of the IPM management plan for the Downtown Phoenix Campus. If a pest is discovered we will do our best to remove them using a water hose. If need be only an organic based insecticide is used. Weeds are manually removed but pre-emergent’s are used in the granite areas and applied once a year at the end of summer/beginning of fall.

Integrated Pest Management is a systematic approach to managing pests which focuses on long-term prevention or suppression with minimal impact on human health, the environment and non target organisms. IPM incorporates all reasonable measures to prevent pest problems by physical, biological or chemical pest population management methods to reduce pest to acceptable levels and prevent unacceptable damage or annoyance.

Procedures
The campus grounds are monitored regularly by our in house grounds staff who are instructed to report issues to the Supervisor of Grounds Operations. The Supervisor will visually inspect campus and those items reported to him regularly to determine if further action is necessary. If he determines this is the case he will review the issue with the Assistant Director of Grounds, Building Services and Sustainability to determine appropriate actions to take. If chemical means are deemed necessary, the product with the least harmful effects to the environment will be selected.

Cultural Practices and Preventative Measures
Where chronic pest problems have occurred on a historical basis, preventative measures including chemical applications may be used to prevent damage that will be both unsightly and costly to repair. 

Dormant oils and non chemical means are used to manage insects at acceptable levels on high quality/visibility ornamental plantings.

Soil fertility in lawn areas is maintained with an organic approach to maintain turf vigor and to allow for natural defenses and recovery to pest and disease problems and to minimize use of synthetic fertilizers.

High quality lawns and fields are irrigated to maintain growth rate, appearance and recovery capabilities.

High quality lawns and fields are aerated regularly to maintain vigor and natural pest defenses.

Turf seed is selected for repair and maintenance to have good recovery and wear tolerance characteristics.

Native trees and shrubs will be selected for future plantings on campus that are acclimated to the local climate.

NOTE: The remaining acres of campus beyond the 145 are forested areas that are unmaintained and therefore not monitored as outlined in the IPM plan.

Equipment used includes plow trucks, rotary brooms or blades, and heavy equipment.  Once pavements are cleared, salt products are applied with equipment or by hand if necessary.  Sodium chloride (road salt) is used on streets and drives and an ice-melter mix of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and sodium chloride is used on walks, ramps and steps.  A liquid ice-melter is used to pretreat surfaces before a snow event, when snowfalls are less than 1/2"" and to pre-wet road salt as it's applied.

About fives miles northwest of Beloit College, there is a quiet patch of woods. Nestled between patches of farmland, this 50-acre piece of land has remained untouched by development for years. This is Chamberlin Springs, a nature preserve owned by the college. In the 1800s the property was owned by Thomas Chamberlin, an accomplished geologist and 1866 Beloit graduate. In 1875, Chamberlin and his brother tapped into a small spring on their property and turned a simple woodlot into a big spring-water business—and a regional hot spot. The Chamberlin brothers’ brochure referred to the water as “the golden mean between excess and deficiency,” and claimed it would cure a laundry list of ailments, from rheumatism to whiny children. Visitors from as far as Chicago would come and stay for several days to soak up the health benefits of the spring water.
Eventually the spring fell out of use, and the land was mostly forgotten, used only once in a while for picnics and retreats. In 1946, the Chamberlin family gave the land to Beloit College for educational and recreational purposes. Today, Chamberlin Springs is the site of many field trips and research projects, from animal behavior observation to cataloging of geological features.""",--,--,"Beloit College has areas on campus that are considered native landscaping, and control of noxious and invasive weeds is conducted through ad-hoc sustainable strategies.

Ecological parameters in our landscape plan include: reducing use of fossil fuels; maintaining a vegetative buffer along the shore and waterways; promoting a diverse campus landscape with both maintained cultural and self-maintained “wild” landscapes; and recognizing habitat values of the campus. This approach translates into specific practices such as: composting leaves and food waste on site to use as fertilizer in garden beds; chipping small branches on site to use as mulch; allowing larger woody material to decompose on site; using bioswales to allow infiltration of storm water runoff; reusing landscaping material and sourcing material as locally as possible when repurposed materials are not available; using gravel for parking and walkways instead of pavement to reduce runoff and increase infiltration. All campus landscaping is maintained using organic methods. In addition, our farm properties are certified organic by the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association in accordance with USDA's national organic standards. ","The south end of campus has mature woods, characterized by native evergreen species, which provides wildlife habitat and a sense of wilderness on campus. Succession, invasive species, and existing wetlands are managed to preserve the integrity of this area. The campus’ shoreline and roadside are characterized by a diversity of species (native as well as invasive), and these areas are managed to foster the growth of native species. Appropriate non-native introductions may be used in certain parts of the campus in conjunction with campus improvements—provided they meet hardiness and compatibility requirements. In selecting plants for permanent gardens and plantings, native species or species that are low maintenance, disease and deer resistant, and non-invasive are used. Systematic manual removal of invasive species is ongoing throughout campus, in accordance with the campus landscape plan. ","All landscape debris including grass and leaves is composted on the campus in designated piles. Materials that are very difficult to compost, such as large stumps, are burned on campus to eliminate trucking off. Landscape material is produced and reused on site as much as possible (for instance, wood chips from branches, gravel, and stone). When plants are thinned or divided, they are donated to faculty, staff, and students for their home gardens.

","The ocean frontage of the main campus is protected under the State of Maine/Town of Bar Harbor municipal shoreland zoning ordinance. All vegetation 75 feet back from the normal high water mark along the shore frontage is managed according to a point system, which is designed to keep natural vegetation to hold the soil from eroding and to maintain the aesthetic character of the shoreland zone. We also maintain a buffer along both sides of the one small stream that flows across the property. We maintain small bioswale areas to absorb runoff. Our parking areas and campus paths are made of sand and gravel to allow natural infiltration of water.

Gordon owns Mantis Consulting and has extensive experience working with rodent control in urban environments, designing pest
management programs. The following control program is being implemented as part of the Manhattanville Project:

Conducting surveys of the structures and the surrounding areas before disturbance in order to estimate current rat activity and population; performing least toxic pest control practices such as baiting, trapping, and burrow location prior to demolition or structure disturbance; tracking activity during disturbance; performing follow-up surveys and trapping after disturbance; and practicing good site sanitation including discarding food trash in covered metal receptacles lined with trash bags and emptying food trash.

The general policy is:
The elimination and prevention of vermin through  non-chemical methods wherever possible.  In general, non-chemical control alternatives are always to be considered prior to the application of pesticides.  Where pesticide use is deemed to be essential, the judicious selection shall consider the least toxic treatment possible with emphasis on limiting the potential exposure to the community.  The evaluation of the toxicity and exposure potential with any application of pesticides is necessary to assure that the “least toxic, least impact” alternative is chosen.

The next step is to reduce or eliminate the causes of infestation with long-term solutions such as engineering, maintenance and sanitation methods, together with education.","Columbia University removes invasive species by manual removal such as cattails in the Muscota Marsh; provides cultural practices to ensure adequate cover of turf to effortlessly absorb rainfall, and selects plant material appropriate for hardiness zone, including improved cultivars.
","Organic mulches are used in and around the landscape plantings, grass clippings are recycled and returned to the turf reducing nutrient inputs, and leaves and organic debris are collected and taken to a composting facility.
","The University lawns are constantly being improved with cultivation techniques including core aeration, seed selection, and judicious irrigation practices with a computerized system that has demonstrated to maintain optimum soil moisture for plant growth. Trees and shrub soils are periodically loosened by a process called air spading-that decreases soil compaction in the root zone. Display gardens are fertilized with organic products.
","The University uses improved varieties of grass seed and plant material, appropriate for this hardiness zone, and most tolerant of conditions found in urban campus grounds.  Street trees are planted in accordance with guidelines set forth by the borough forester, to ensure survivability in the harshest of growing conditions.  Several years ago, mature American Elm trees were destroyed by high winds on campus, and a similar, yet improved variety of elm was planted to replace the disease-ridden American elms.
","By maintaining a healthy stand of turfgrasses, soil erosion in minimal at both sites.  Computerized irrigation systems ensure that plants receive the proper amount of moisture, and can automatically shut off in the event of a broken water pipe or heavy rain event. At Muscota Marsh, a tertiary weir system, combined with aquatic plant material,  filters runoff water prior to it’s ultimate release into the salt marsh.
"," 
Prior to the start of each snow season, employees are re-trained on the proper techniques to apply deicing materials; equipment is carefully calibrated for proper application rates; and weather stations and forecasts are monitored in real time to track the potential storm intensity and impact on the campuses. When feasible, snow and ice removal is accomplished by plows and brushing, and chemical treatment is applied only when necessary.  Deicing products are directed toward targeted areas, not haphazardly applied.
","Muscota Marsh is notable for its views and for its ecological conservation features, and is unusual for having both a freshwater marsh and a salt marsh in such a tiny (<1 acre) area. Besides attracting plant and animal life, these wetlands are intended to help filter rainwater runoff and thereby improve the water quality of the Harlem River.

The 1,400 acres of open space comprise 61% of the main campus area and approximately 90% of our total grounds area.  They include managed landscapes, natural areas and the arboretum, as well as crop fields, pastures and wooded areas used for teaching and research.  The Grounds Dept. follows IPM procedures in maintaining the campus landscape.  By doing so, pesticide use on campus is reduced every year.  To control insects, weeds and plant diseases that threaten the lawn, flower, shrub, and tree species, IPM uses a holistic approach that includes many cultural pest control techniques:  
•	Naturalized landscape design, emphasizing a diversity of species
•	Careful site selection and preparation
•	Use of hearty, disease- and pest-resistant varieties
•	Proper frequencies of watering, pruning, and mowing
•	Mulching
•	Introduction of naturally occurring organisms to control pests

Cornell Plantations cares for about 200 acres of botanical gardens and arboretum as well as a 3000+ square foot greenhouse, a lath house and a raised bed nursery utilizing Integrated Pest Management practices. There are many facets to this system from installation to long-term garden management.  Preventative care is established through proper site selection and preparation prior to plant installation.  In-depth scouting and monitoring of our collections is conducted for specific pests as well as yearly general assessments throughout the collections.  Mechanical practices such as pruning, fall sanitation, utilizing water pressure and even hand removal of pests are employed to limit the need for pesticides.  When chemical control becomes necessary, the staff strive to choose pesticides with least toxic properties.  Plantations works to reduce the need for herbicides through mechanical weed control whenever possible, both in the gardens and the arboretum.  Finally, the program is supported with detailed records of treatment for reference and encouraging the education of the staff of gardeners.  

Cornell Plantations also manages the system of natural areas on campus. These areas are actively protected and managed to support the educational mission of the University.  Management activities include but are not limited to monitoring, habitat establishment, natural areas restoration, naturalization, invasive species control, and deer over-population management. 

The CU AES farm managers follow IPM practices on the greatest majority of their land, production cropland and wherever IPM practices will complement a given research project. The forests are minimally managed, with some selective thinning. CU AES has been removing ash trees in an attempt to minimize the spread of the emerald ash borer, as well as some removal of unwanted or invasive species. The College of Veterinary Medicine manages its pasture lands without the use of any pesticides.",We are currently developing a sustainable landscape management plan for campus that reflects the new criteria under STARS.,"Various departments at the University - academic and administrative - manage landscape areas. There has been a long-standing practice of prioritizing and using native plant species in campus landscaping, both in the maintained grounds as well as in the campus landscapes that are used for teaching, research and conservation.   This practice is in the process of being formalized into a native plants policy.  While the policy is not yet complete, we continue the practice of ensuring that all new projects include native plants in their site landscape.  The growing number of green infrastructure projects on campus include native plants as well.","The majority of the agricultural composting at Cornell is carried out by  Farm Services, a Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station (CUAES) operation and includes far more than waste from grounds keeping (please see details in the attached public notes).  What constitutes University Grounds includes an extensive area used for agricultural teaching, research and outreach.

Since 1992, the Cornell Grounds department has collected thousands of cubic yards of yard waste from normal lawn maintenance activities.  All yard waste is ground and composted in order to reduce and reuse materials.  This reduces disposal fees, transportation costs and the need to buy topsoil.  These management practices have reduced the amount of material going into landfills as well as the contamination of water sources on and adjacent to the campus.

Grounds maintains over 53 miles of sidewalks. Through the University's earlier Advancing Sustainability Action Plan (ASAP) we had identified just over 2 miles (~4%) of walkway closures for winter maintenance.    This seasonal closing equates to a reduction of salt usage, equipment fuel, and savings in lawn damage repairs totaling $11K annually.  

The Grounds Dept. tested a new type of salt spreader in 2012-2013 and found that the new technology allowed greater operator calibration and placement of salt along walkways.  Three more of these more efficient spreaders were purchased for the 2013-14 snow season.  

Plantations has 5.3 miles of trails of which they have no winter maintenance on 2.2 miles (~ 42%). 

2) Through a specific program for efficiency in application and materials.  Cornell University has had a De-icing Salt Conservation (Sensible Salt/Calibration) Program in place since 1987.  The program emphasizes the most economical use of de-icing salt while maintaining safety on roads and for the environment.  The metrics are Environmental, Economic and Social.  Environmental metrics include proper storage, handling, application, drainage, and landscaping.  Economic metrics include lower operating costs due to reduced salt, as well as continued safe operation of roads.  Social metrics include the safety of the campus community and the continuation of campus functions in inclement weather.  

3) To use materials that require less salt over time, to reduce environmental impacts to the extent possible.  Continued in-house employee training and the expansion of de-icing products to include local recycled brine are being actively pursued. Our bulk salt usage for the last 5 years has been fairly static at 1800 Tons per season with a backup amount of 500 Tons in reserve.",Cornell's Mann Library Garden (0.1 acres) was one of the original 13 pilot projects certified under the Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES).,True,http://fm.fs.cornell.edu/file/Pesticide%20pdf.pdf,"While we are reporting only within the main campus boundary, Cornell University has a much larger extended campus as well as research stations within the county and New York State.

Pesticide applications are made only when necessary, and herbicide and insecticide applications are made only as spot treatments in problem areas, not in blanket applications. This, along with the elimination of preventive pesticide applications, reduces the amount of pesticide use. Cultural and natural practices include over seeding with pest-resistant grass varieties, fertilization and liming per soil test results, soil aeration, proper mowing height, and irrigation, where possible. Our goal is to maintain a healthy stand of turf and ornamental plantings that will withstand occasional pest infestations and require only limited use of pesticides. Tree, extermination, and horticultural professionals are also called on in certain situations to provide expert evaluations and recommendations.  A-L services, our landscape management provider, helps monitor the campus and reports to us when insect and/or disease thresholds reach a point that need to be addressed.

Through a partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the New Jersey Audubon Society in the summer of 2011, the University removed non-native species, such as wisteria and bittersweet vines, from nearly 10 acres of campus. These non-native species were detrimental to the survival of native trees. Native trees, shrubs, wildflowers and ferns were planted and allowed to flourish. Furthermore, a Forest Restoration Project has created a 10 acre deer exclosure to restore the forest floor by preventing deer grazing and removing invasive species so that native plants can replace them and fill in the understory.",All leaf debris and landscape refuge is brought to a recycling facility to be turned into mulch and or soil.,Trees that fall in the campus arboretum and Forest Preserve are left to decompose naturally.,Most leaves are reused in campus mulch.,"The new bio-retention basin part of Drew's student center parking lot renovation will divert all stormwater from the public sewer system.

Most equipment used on roadways and large sidewalks is gasoline powered (snow blowers, snow plows with the biggest blade for the fewest passes possible, skid loaders). A lot of shoveling is also used at door entries, interior stairways, dumpster areas, and for clearing off flat roofs. Rock Salt is used on pavements for ice. A product called Safer Salt is used on pathways. We used calcium chloride in the past, but it is harsh on surrounding vegetation. With Safer Salt, less product is required because it melts at a more rapid rate. Due to fact that this product works faster it does not need to be put to the edge of walkways maintaining a respectable border to vegetation. This product provides for an overall safer campus because it works faster and it is less harmful. This year we put up four foot poles between December 16th and December 31st to guide snow blowers so they stay on asphalt and do not damage vegetation.

All of the grounds are monitored and tended to in a way to support the health of the plants. Planting techniques, compost, and native species are all used to deter pests. In general, the plants on campus have a high threshold for insects, and sprays are only used as a last resort in a highly targeted and controlled manner. The acreage that requires more rigorous pest management are the 20 acres of athletic fields.

The entire 55 acre Duke Gardens and horticultural facilities are managed with IPM strategies (https://gardens.duke.edu/).  The threshold for pest and disease is relatively high depending on the location in the garden and type of pest.   The goal is to eventually manage the garden organically.  The hybrid tea rose collection (which requires weekly spraying of fungicide) is being replaced with roses that require no spraying or other chemical treatment to keep them healthy, all the garden’s green/woody waste will soon be composted and or mulched and reused in the garden.

The Discovery Garden is only 1 of 15 projects that has received SITES certification nationwide.  In order to achieve SITES certification, Duke Gardens staff, who maintain the Discovery Garden, have to follow a set of stringent and comprehensive integrated pest management guidelines.  The Discovery Garden, therefore, is an exemplary garden that showcases both comprehensive integrated pest management practices and sustainable landscaping.  

","Duke focuses on establishing low maintenance, healthy landscapes through appropriate plant species selection, targeted use of chemicals, and reliance on cultural practices to create the aesthetic desired.","Duke has a vigorous tree protection program, which helps protect both trees and soil during construction. Natural landscapes on campus are being studied for their ecological and social benefit and decisions will be made as to the best was to manage these large tracts of land. We do not plant any federally or state listed noxious or invasive plants, and avoid planting species which have a high likelihood of becoming invasive in the future. We focus on native plants whenever possible, and put a premium on biodiversity in our landscape renovation. In addition to avoiding the introduction of invasive species, we are also establishing an invasive species removal protocol.

A special emphasis is placed on the use of native plant species in landscaping at Duke University. New landscaping projects always involve the installation of native plants. Native plants and their associated ecosystems are featured in the 7 acre Blomquist Garden of Native Plants.    Over 1,000 species of flora native to the southeastern US are on display and are conserved by two full-time gardeners.  The Duke Gardens Facility is a member of the NC Native Plant Society and the staff frequently participates in plant rescue events across the state.   Native plants are also frequently used in other sections of the gardens and receive strong emphasis in new garden projects. The Duke Forest hosts 900 species of plants and supports a wide cross-section of the woodlands found in the upper coastal plain and lower piedmont of the Southeast.","Duke University Grounds has a commitment to reuse landscape waste.  We strive to minimize the use of chemicals and other products on campus.  Most trees and woody vegetation that are cut down are reused as woodchip mulch.  Sometimes wood is reused for lumber projects.  Leaves that fall on campus are mowed and reapplied on mulch beds to improve soil quality.  When feasible, some landscape waste is composted off site in a location in Duke Forest.","We use slow release fertilizers on an as-needed basis, and mulch leaves into our beds for nutrient cycling.

The integrated pest management protocol consists of six principles: 1 - identify the pest to be managed, 2 - define the management area, 3 - establish monitoring techniques, 4 - establish thresholds of tolerance (health, economic, aesthetic), 5 - develop predictive models for each target pest and 6 - develop a management plan and schedule for each target pest. Although specific practices vary widely, there are several guidelines. 
First, the campus landscape will be maintained to meet established standards of landscape management and appearance.  Typically, the thresholds of tolerance will be damage and/or appearance. Secondly, in accordance with IPM principles, the order of control options should be: plant species options; cultural; physical or mechanical; biorational; biological; and lastly synthetic chemical control.

The area surrounding Cliffs Cottage, the Susan Shi ornamental garden, is a highlight of the university's xeriscaped landscape. Other areas of campus which employ xeriscape techniques include the landscape at Farmer Hall, our new Child Development Center, Tennis Center, Track Infield, and several recreation fields on campus.


The Lake Resotration Project addresses runoff and erosion by planting native wildflower meadows on the shore.  They intercept and absorb more surface runoff than turfgrass, and also add more color, structure, and diversity.

Example: Pickerel Weed is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas, ranging from Canada to Argentina. The plant can become invasive, but they are very efficient biological filters of polluted water in artificial wetlands like Furman Lake.

On July 3, 2006, there were 362 waterfowl on the 28 acres of Furman Lake, including 250 Canada geese.  By most wildlife estimates, a density of 2 geese/acre is appropriate, 6-times less than our resident population.  Through a combination of direct removals by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, publicity campaigns to discourage public feeding of the waterfowl, and habitat change, the Canada geese population is now near appropriate levels (See figure).  In order to evaluate the impact of the restoration project on Canada geese behavior, Ecology students monitored the patterns of habitat use in areas with different vegetation types around the lake.","Furman conducts waste audits  in the Furman Organic Garden.


Leaves, grass, and other non-woody landscape waste are combined with pre-consumer waste from the dining hall, and resulting compost is used in the organic-practice campus garden. The remaining campus waste, consisting mainly of dead or fallen tree limbs, is collected by a team of Facilities Services staff. The limbs are placed in a limb yard on the far north end of campus, where they are ground into mulch twice a year. This mulch meets a large percentage of the campus mulching need.
","Furman utilizes soil management through crop rotations, companion planting,
and vermiculture (cultivation of earthworms for compost and soil management).","In the past decade, Furman has used a number of different LID practices and products on a multitude of projects – both new and renovation. These include: structural grass pavement and gravel pavement, porous concrete pavement, pervious brick pavement (with underdrain filtration), native plants, solar energy, rainwater harvesting and storage for irrigation, salvaging of construction materials and stock piling for future use, low VOC paints and adhesives, bio-retention ponds and surfaces, detention ponds, grass filtration strips, buffers on both sides of Little Creek, and manufactured structures such as catch basin inserts, cyclone separators and offset bay separators.

","George Washington University strives to manage landscapes in a responsible, sustainable, and strategic manner.  Aesthetics and appearance are always important factors on a university campus, but GW's main goal is to improve the health of the campus ecosystem and maximize usability for the campus community.

GW released a groundbreaking Ecosystems Enhancement Plan in Spring 2012. This plan includes targets and goals for increasing and enhancing biodiversity on campus. GW is committed to enhancing the biological richness/diversity of the campus and is targeting to create design guidelines around outdoor space that are habitat friendly and promote non-invasive plants. The university plans to; 
1) Conduct a habitat assessment 
2) Encourage native/adaptive/non-invasive/drought-resistant plantings and pro-habitat landscaping practices using the following criteria for plantings - appearance, adaptability, security and survivability
3) Partner with local NGOs to raise awareness about local urban ecosystems, indigenous species and preservation tactics. (E.g. Casey Trees)
4) Reduce the number of annuals planted
5) Place more bird houses around campus
6) Encourage elimination of all pesticides on/in the campus landscape
7) Encourage use of natural predators to manage pests
8) Connect campuses to green ways within the region

The GW Office of Sustainability works closely with the GW Grounds team on enhancing the sustainability of the landscaping on campus. At the time of submission the Office is working with stakeholders on campus to draft sustainable grounds guidelines.

Overall, sustainability is the cornerstone of GW's Landscape Management philosophy.  GW's goal is to create a living, regenerative ecosystem on the urban campus.  This goal is only able to be accomplished through prudent, environmentally responsible landscaping.    ","To attain this goal, GW has begun a variety of sustainable landscaping programs.  These programs include Grass to Gardens, Pollinator Gardening, Edible Landscaping, Pesticide Free Landscaping, and a commitment to the Tenets of Xeriscaping.  

Grass to Gardens is an effort to replace unusable patches of turf with native plant beds that will reduce runoff, bolster biodiversity, attract native invertebrates, and improve soil health.  The native beds also reduce labor and noise pollution associated with mowing and other turf maintenance activities.  Eliminating these unusable turf areas also allows GW to focus on large, usable turf that actually can be used by the university community. 

GW's Pollinator Gardening program involves rehabilitating aging landscape beds with native flowering shrubs and perennials that provide food and forage for birds and invertebrates.  These beds are strategically placed throughout campus to create a greenway, allowing pollinators to move through campus as they forage for pollen.

GW's Edible Landscaping program uses annual and perennial edible plant material to create aesthetically pleasing, edible garden beds throughout campus.  GW grows Rhubarb, Hops, Basil, Peppers, Rosemary, Thyme, Lemongrass, and Pineapple Sage in display beds throughout campus.  The edibles are then harvested and distributed biweekly to the university community during GW's Herb Giveaways. 

GW's campus is also Pesticide-Free, allowing for unrestricted use and enjoyment of the university community.  This year GW began a beneficial insect program to create native populations of beneficial insects to combat common plant pests such as aphids, scale insects, and mites.  This program will continue to expand over the coming years as GW gathers data and begins to find the most effective methods of biologic control for plant pathogens.  Not applying pesticides also helps to bolster efforts to increase biodiversity and create an edible landscape.  

The Tenets of Xeriscaping serve as a framework for all plantings on campus.  Basically, Xeriscaping entails planting the right plant in the right place.  By identifying microclimates and choosing site appropriate plant material, GW can reduce water usage, improve stormwater infiltration, increase aesthetic appeal, and reduce labor.  All of these results are extremely beneficial to the Grounds Management program and the campus ecosystem. ",On-site composting is currently performed on the main campus. The main location is the on-site community garden near Ross Hall where a composter is used for the garden waste. All organic yard waste generated by the Grounds Department is collected and disposed in a 30 yard container that is composted by Maryland Environmental Service.,"Conserving and improving soil health on campus is a necessary step when creating a sustainable landscape.   GW tests its soils periodically to ensure proper pH, CEC, and nutrient content to promote vigorous plant growth, stop unneeded fertilization, and inhibit the leaching of nutrients such as Phosphorus into runoff water.  These tests are essential to ensure that environmentally damaging nutrients are not entering the sewer system during large scale storm events.  

Organic matter is incorporated into the soil to reduce compaction and improve soil health in turf areas and landscape beds.  Using organic material in lieu of conventional turf fertilizers reduces harmful runoff and creates an environment for beneficial soil fungi and bacteria to thrive.  These beneficial fungi and bacteria increase the soils ability to hold plant available nutrients and sequester harmful compounds from leaching into the groundwater.

The majority of soil on GW's campus is located in planting beds adjacent to buildings, and was brought to campus during construction.  This creates a relatively uniform soil profile throughout campus, which is beneficial to GW's soil management program, but also results in compaction and poor soil composition due to the incorporation of backfill.  To address this issue, GW incorporates organic matter into the soil to create a naturally balanced and beneficial root zone for plant material.  Proper soil management is the cornerstone of a sustainable campus landscape and has profound effects on plant and ecosystem health.     
","To attain the goal of creating a regenerative, sustainable landscape on campus, GW makes every effort to use environmentally preferable materials in all landscaping projects.  These include native plants, locally sourced plant material, reusable/recyclable packaging material, permeable pavers, rain barrels, weather sensing irrigation controllers, biologic controls for plant pathogens, and Low Impact Development (LID) procedures on all new construction projects.  

GW's native plants are all locally sourced, and the pots are reused by the Horticulturist to propagate and divide seedlings and cuttings to increase plant populations on campus.  By cultivating and propagating plant material from campus, GW is increasing biodiversity and genetic diversity in its plant populations.  

GW's Integrated Pest Management program, which includes beneficial insect releases, has eliminated the need for pesticides on campus.  This program will become more and more effective as further research is done to identify the best times for releases and monitoring the beneficial insect populations existing on campus.  This program also goes hand in hand with GW's efforts to increase biodiversity and native invertebrate populations on campus.  

The university has made a commitment to attain at a minimum LEED Silver certification on all new construction projects on campus.  These sites all feature permeable pavers, drip irrigation, and other LID features to manage stormwater runoff and reduce the environmental impact of the site.  ""Square 80"" is the reference name for GW's SITES Sustainable Landscape that features a large underground cistern powered irrigation system, which captures and reuses all rainwater on the site.  This commitment to sustainable development also results in a large number of green roofs on campus to save energy and insulate the buildings. 

Large amounts of biomass and other landscape debris are disposed of through Maryland Environmental Service (MES).  GW collects all of organic landscape waste, which is then collected and composted by MES.  This prevents the damaging side effects of disposing organic material in a conventional waste stream.  All of the nutrients inside of the plant material are reused in compost, as opposed to leaching into the groundwater as they decompose in a landfill.  

50% of irrigation on campus is done by hand, and GW has begun to retrofit existing conventional irrigation systems with smart controllers and low volume rotor head sprinklers to avoid water waste.  The smart controllers monitor weather conditions, rainfall, and wind to increase, decrease, or eliminate watering cycles on a given day.  Overall these irrigation improvements have created a very positive effect and eliminated problems, such as overspray onto pedestrians on windy days and systems running during rain storms.  ","Restoring and protecting the natural hydrologic cycles on campus is an intrinsic part of GW's sustainable grounds maintenance program.  Expansion and construction on an urban campus tend to decrease permeable surfaces and have a detrimental effect on how water moves through the ecosystem.  GW's commitment to environmentally conscious expansion includes the use of permeable paving material, green roofs, rain barrels, and native plantings to increase rainwater infiltration and reduce nonpoint source pollutants from entering the Potomac Watershed. 

Permeable pavers are used throughout campus and serve to create areas for public use and enjoyment without causing a spike in effective imperviousness and disruption to the natural hydrology of the ecosystem.  These pavers reduce sheet flow during large rain events and allow the water to infiltrate into the groundwater or be collected for irrigation use.  In combination with our vegetated rooftops and cistern powered irrigation systems, the university is capturing and utilizing rainwater to improve aesthetics, reduce runoff, and protect adjacent watersheds.   

Native, site appropriate plant material is used throughout campus to improve water percolation through landscape beds.  The roots of these plants push through the soil and create a healthy rhizosphere, which increases beneficial soil organisms and battles compaction.  A thriving rhizosphere also promotes better plant health and creates a living filter for nonpoint source pollutants that can leach through normal landscaping beds.  

GW's sustainable landscape management practices are all linked together by the goal of creating a living, regenerative, ecosystem on campus.  Protecting naturally occurring biologic cycles is not only beneficial to the environment, it also results in thriving, aesthetically pleasing landscape beds.  Through prudent planning and an understanding of ecosystem interactions, GW is able to create a usable, beautiful, and sustainable campus landscape for generations of future students and community members.  
","When absolutely necessary, and when human safety is in question, GW applies Landscapers Choice with Calcium Magnesium Acetate (CMA). CMA is an alternative de-icer that has fewer environmental impacts than road salt.","Joining only 30 other projects in the world,  George Washington University's Square 80 officially received recognition on February 4th as a Certified Sustainable Sites (SITES™) project.
 
The Square 80 courtyard replaces an existing parking lot and service alleys with an urban plaza, expansive lawn, ornamental tree grove, extensive pedestrian network and an outdoor classroom for GW's Masters Degree Program in Sustainable Landscape Design. Utilizing multiple Low Impact Development (LID) techniques, 90% of on-site stormwater runoff is retained. Sustainable project elements include: biofiltration planters, native plant material, pervious pavers, cisterns and rain barrel to capture overflow water and roof top rainwater for irrigation purposes and to use in the recycled sculptural water feature. Finally, the design includes the use of a rain garden and bioswale filtration in between the two residence halls.

GC allows Grounds Department to be in on the Campus Planning and Design Phase. 

a-	Design phase which decides which plants, soils, damages, etc the landscape may receive due to new landscape installation.  Plants under stress are more susceptible to insects and diseases.  We try and eliminate pest problems at the front by choice of each aspect and what it will affect.  Planning for the future as best we can, if sometimes we are vetoed then we look at other options.  

b-	Inclusive in the design phase of landscaping we can affect so much. 

1-request specific plants that have a high affinity for pests problems not be allowed on our campus or if needed for diversity of plant material to limit them to specific areas. 
 
2- Being aware of the pest problems we may be able to add extra drainage to solve the problems before the plants are installed by amending the soil or designing in extra shade. 

3- We believe that soil is best when it includes composted dirt and or if not able to do this to add in types of Mycorrhizae into the soil to assist in plant health which is holistic with water, etc.  

4- Making sure that all designs are around the proper microclimate in which the plant would best perform with undue stress which attracts pest problems. 

5- We are aware of most seasonal pests, and their time of arrival, we even keep “indicator plants” planted so that we know where to go look first to see the beginning of “Aphid Season” or “Spider Mite season”.  We keep a log of the pests and the plants they seasonally attack and monitor them. Quite often only needing a pesticide application every 2 or 3 years to get the pest back into check.,ie:  tea scale on Camellias

6- Limit and control the irrigation design so as to be able to water sunny sides of bldgs. different from shady sides, to isolate particular plants and needs in the design phase.  We limit irrigation to only establish plants and then keep them alive, we are not interested in watering for waterings sake. We stop watering early in late summer to fall to get plant shutdown for winter.

Before  Considering a Chemical Spraying we have to determine the following 

1.	Acceptable pest levels:  We establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls if those thresholds are crossed and if it is required.  Often pests are temporary and the population will explode until mother nature gets them under control without affecting the Health of the plant.  If and when a pest is determined to be detrimental to that plant we only spray that species if it is affected (ie: as in on the southside of the building it may be affected but not on the northside of the bldg). Sometimes like late summer on Lantana we may cut off the tops (spider mites) remove foliage and pest, then follow with a mild spray and let regrow. 

2.	Preventive cultural practices: Selecting varieties best for local growing conditions, and maintaining healthy crops, is the first line of defense, together with 'cultural techniques' such as crop sanitation (e.g. removal of diseased plants to prevent spread of infection).

3.	Monitoring: Inspection and Identification. Accurate pest identification is critical to a successful IPM program. Record-keeping is essential, as is a thorough knowledge of the behavior and reproductive cycles of target pests. 

4.	Mechanical controls: Should a pest reach an unacceptable level, mechanical methods are the first options to consider. They include hosing the plant off,  putting out baits, collecting to see if damage is truly occurring. 

5.	Biological controls:  Natural biological processes and materials can provide control, with minimal environmental impact, and often at low cost. The main focus here is on promoting other wildlife to stay in the rural setting we have to assist us. Birds, beneficial insects, micro-organisms (BT) Bacteria usage mycorrhizae in the soil and others. 

6.	Pesticide Use: Synthetic are generally only used as required and often only at specific times in a pests life cycle, or only to know a population down for plants to recuperate.  Many of the newer pesticide groups are derived from plants or naturally occurring substances 

An IPM regime can be quite simple or sophisticated.  Although originally developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now developed to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that interfere with the management objectives of sites such as residential and commercial structures, lawn and turf areas, and home and community gardens.

IPM is the intelligent selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favorable economic, ecological and sociological consequences. Reliance on knowledge, experience, observation, and integration of multiple techniques makes IPM a perfect fit for  landscapes in university settings in which the crew has a vested interest from the beginning of design all the way to implementation of IPM program.

The native plants manager brushes glyphosate on select invasive species in the natural areas following the invasive species policy.  GMC’s land management procedures emphasize the early detection and control of invasive plant species following guidelines in the Invasive Species Policy (established 2006), and prevention of pests on managed lands through the use of native species, which provide food and habitat for bird populations that control insects. The Native Species Landscaping Policy (2010) makes species native to the region the general rule and requires justification of non-native species plantings based in part on assurance that these species are not invasive. Plants for landscaping are purchased from growers in the region to help reduce the transmission of animal pests. Grounds crews look to identify problems early and use have-a-heart traps and environmentally
sound pest treatments minimally when necessary.

Cerridwen Farm practices organic control methods that rely primarily on crop rotations and diversity for pest control and only use organically approved pest control methods when thresholds of economic damage have been passed. This management applies to 2.5 acres of gardens, 0.07 acres of high tunnel production, and 13.3 acres of pasture.","Green Mountain College aims to make land management as integral to its sustainability programs as its progressive efforts to reduce its carbon footprint or promote sustainable food systems. To guide the development of sustainable landscape management, The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (CBD 2002), the International Agenda for Botanic Gardens in Conservation (Wyse Jackson and Sutherland 2000), and the North American Botanic Garden Strategy for Plant Conservation (BGCI 2006) have been useful models. Land management is evaluated by a Land Use Committee, consisting of faculty, facilities staff, and students. GMC focuses on two aspects of land management – natural areas, and the designed-built landscape.

In college Natural Areas, the general approach is to allow natural processes to occur. However, since riparian forests on campus have been in almost continuous agriculture for over 200 years, and since invasive species displace native species, GMC also practices restoration that includes invasive species management and plantings of native species. A summer Natural Areas Crew managed by a
faculty member with expertise in plant ecology implements invasive species management plans. This year (FY 2015) the invasive species management is largely delegated to a half-time AmeriCorps member, the Native Plants Manager. The 14.2 acre Buffer Zone along the Poultney River is an area that receives extra protection and care. It was designated in 1997 to restore and protect the health of the river and act as an educational resource for the GMC community. Since 2001, the Buffer Zone has been part of 39 acres of natural areas on the main campus. In natural areas, vegetation is allowed to grow up naturally in some areas and has been planted with native species in other areas, establishing floodplain forest with both educational and ecosystem values.

On the designed campus, the College follows the IPM and organic soils management strategies outlined above in the IPM plan section. Additionally, the College aims to reduce the ecological footprint of planted landscapes by increasing its use of native species, and reducing the extent of lawns and other non-native vegetation. In 2010 the College adopted its Native Species Landscaping Policy, and it
has approved a proposal to replace existing invasive ornamentals (such as Burning Bush) with native species. Additionally, in order to protect the health of the native maple trees that dominate central campus, the grounds crew rake most of the leaves into tree rings under the trees so that the nutrients can return to the root systems. This aids the native trees, and also minimizes the use of fossil fuels for more traditional methods of leaf removal.

","Plant communities in college natural areas are managed to promote native wildflowers, trees, and other plants through control of non-native species under the College’s Invasive Species Management Policy (2006). Garlic mustard, Morrow’s honeysuckle, glossy buckthorn, and Japanese knotweed are actively removed by a summer Natural Areas Crew of students, a special Earth Week event, and several classes throughout the school year, under the supervision of a faculty member. The work is led primarily by a half-time AmeriCorps member whose work focuses on land management on campus. GMC’s native species landscaping policy approved in 2010 aims to make landscaping with native species the norm. Plantings of non-native species require a special exception with justification. Additionally, the College's sustainable purchasing policy (2014) states that groundskeeping will purchase native,
non-invasive species as much as possible for decorative gardening.

Several completely native gardens are maintained by faculty and students, and a plan is approved to replace invasive ornamental plants on campus with native species. ","The sustainable purchasing policy (2014) states that ""waste materials such as mulch, dirt, compost, sod, and leaves should be redistributed and used around campus."" Most of this material is either incorporated into tree rings around the native maple trees on central campus or used as a source of carbon for compost piles on the farm. Occasionally, the facilities department has a small burn pile for the most woody material. ","Cerridwen Farm at Green Mountain College manages three acres of vegetable production, seventeen acres of mixed hay and pasture land, and approximately 0.25 acres of production under cover.  All lands are managed organically from a soil fertility perspective through the use of animal manures from the farm’s livestock, mulches consisting of waste hay and leaves from campus, and compost purchased from Vermont Compost Company. Organic waste matter from the campus dining services is composted with animal manure and also used.

Soil tests are performed periodically to assess for nutrient shortages as well as to guard against overuse of manures. Pasture fertility is primarily maintained through management-intensive grazing techniques although some manure is spread on these lands. Purchased compost is only applied to vegetable areas. A small quantity of purchased organic fertilizer is used in indoor growing spaces. In half of the vegetable areas, tillage is minimal.
","The College does not use herbicides or pesticides on the managed campus area in order to protect environmental and human health. The native plants manager brushes glyphosate on select invasive species in the natural areas following the invasive species policy.  The grounds crew uses rakes the majority of the time for leaf removal, cutting down the use of leaf blowers considerably, especially since 2013. Invasive species removal is almost primarily done by hand tools because they are a more environmentally-preferable option and they are more precise than more advanced machinery or herbicides.

GMC's sustainable purchasing policy (2014) states that ""Groundskeeping must continue to be as local and sustainable as possible by sourcing materials from self-sustaining closed loops on campus. Materials that are sourced off-campus should be purchased locally. Stone, seeds, plants, and all other necessary materials that the College purchases for landscaping should also be sourced locally whenever possible.""","The built portions of Green Mountain College campus sit on alluvial terraces not high above the low floodplains of the Poultney River, on deep unconsolidated mixed glacial sediments. Loamy soils range from sandy to high in clay. The coarse-textured soils drain readily, but clay loams on the floodplain drain and dry out slowly. When corn was grown, clay-rich portions of the field were sometimes not planted
after wet springs. The Poultney River is relatively clean because there are few active farms upstream that might be non-point sources of nutrient runoff. Hydrology has been changed in the past: (1) Land clearing on broad floodplains sped runoff and reduced coarse woody debris and its associated habitats in the river. (2) The river channel was straightened and banks hardened with large pieces of slate. (3) A
drainage ditch was constructed to keep the soccer field and adjacent agricultural fields dry. (4) Campus buildings, roads, parking, sidewalks, and lawns increased compaction and runoff.

Several actions by the College have partially restored the natural hydrology since 1997. The College has: (1) established the Buffer Zone to increase infiltration of water, slow runoff, filter nutrients from water before it enters the river, reduce water temperature, and slow water flow in the river, (2) ended the practice of hardening river bank with large rocks to allow the river to meander, (3) let large hay and
corn fields go fallow and go through natural succession in natural areas, (4) planted trees and shrubs to restore forest to portions of the natural areas, (5) planted native species gardens in place of lawn, (6) planted a rain garden and released lawn on the steep slopes between main campus and the floodplain.

In addition, it leases 50 acres to a local dairy farmer, who uses dairy manure for soil amendment.  Other areas of campus are under review for sustainable landscape management, including the ""meadowlands"", where specific parcels will be managed using ecological methods.","All new landscape plantings on campus are native plants.  

1.  The Community Garden has been re-designed. The new design includes the following native plants: 
- Native wildflowers and grasses, such as daisy, aster, and hairy vetch, for optimal bird and beneficial insect attraction.
- All possible native fruit trees and bushes, including apple, blueberry,
strawberry, raspberry, pear, grape, and others.
- Native wild edible and medicinal plants, including lamb's quarters, wild
mustard, and queen anne's lace.

2.  Meadowlands project:  There are a number of fields located on the eastern side of campus (outside of the “ring road”) which have potential to be converted from mowed lawns to other uses, including managing agricultural lands for grassland birds, creating wildlife habitat corridors, and establishing early successional habitat areas for endangered species (e.g., the New England cottontail).    

The project provided a set of recommendations for a phased approach to convert targeted parcels to wildlife and plant habitat areas to the President and Vice President for Finance and Administration in June 2013.  The plan recommended a mix of land to be managed according to ecological principles, using native plant species, appropriate paths and activity areas.  The proposed plan will achieve four objectives:
1.	Greenhouse gas emissions reductions
2.	Creation of wildlife and plant habitat
3.	Teaching/learning and research opportunities
4.	Cost savings

In 2013, a 15 acre parcel was managed as a grassland bird habitat, with haying allowed after July 15.  
In 2015, Hampshire College partnered with the Kestrel Land Trust, Massachusetts Energy and Environmental Affairs, and the Town of Hadley to permanently protect 46 acres of the Mount Holyoke Range, which is part of Hampshire's 800 acre campus.

At the LEED Platinum 46 Blackstone Street, an irrigation free, organic landscape was developed in a courtyard that was previously a parking lot.  Primarily composed of ornamental grasses that are designed to grow roughly six inches to a foot in height, this area provides a home for a family of rabbits who appear to prefer the tall grasses for both food and shelter.  

According to Harvard Landscape and Business Support Manager Wayne Carbone, the maintenance plan ""includes mowing  these areas three to four times annually, followed each time by an application of nutrient rich compost tea."" The mowing helps to ""reduce the tendency of the grass to go to seed while encouraging deeper root growth, thus minimizing the need for watering"", an important trait for landscapes designed to survive without irrigation. 
","1. All landscape waste is composted and reapplied to the landscape system in forms or compost teas, compost, loam and mulch
2. When possible the landscape group mulch mows the turf areas.
","Restoring and maintaining the natural nutrient cycling system is the heart of any organic landscape program. The benefits of this approach include improved nutrient and moisture availability and retention, disease suppression, aeration, and degradation of harmful pollutants achieved through non-chemical or synthetic methods.

Nutrient Retention: beneficial organisms keep valuable nutrients in the proper root zone.  Bacteria and fungi also prevent leaching; a process that removes nitrogen and other nutrients from the soil.  Preventing this material from contaminating the water table is another important benefit.

Nutrient Availability: the symbiotic relationship between fungi and roots helps plants filter needed micronutrients from the soil.  Protozoa feed on bacteria and fungi, excreting nitrogen in a form easily absorbed by plants.  An organic program focuses on building up the components needed to optimize nitrogen and nutrient cycling.

Moisture Retention: organic matter retains water in the root zone long enough to be taken up by plants, dramatically reducing overall water use.  Irrigation needs were reduced by 33% on our organic test plots in 2008.

Pest and Disease Control: beneficial nematodes and fungi protect the roots of plants from potentially harmful organisms always present in the soil.

Aeration: organisms aerate and give structure to the soil by creating air holes and drain pockets.  This process reduces compaction and maximizes water availability to the root zone.

Degradation of Pollutants: properly managed soil includes organisms that consume a wide-range of pollutants across a variety of environmental conditions."," Choosing the proper plants and placing them in optimum areas is vital to building a sustainable landscape. Plants need good soils and adequate natural sunlight to flourish. They also need a spot where their natural size and shape will be uninhibited. Considerations of plant size, color, and suitability to the surroundings should include anticipated interaction with people as well as existing and future plants

Proper pruning and installation of any landscape is essential. The following are a few techniques for ensuring the landscape gets a good start.

A comprehensive soil analysis is needed to determine the baseline biological requirements.
Plants should always be transported and handled carefully to avoid damage.

Plants should be installed following the American National Standard for transplanting of trees, also known as ANSI A300.

Careful pruning of inner and outer foliage encourages a natural growth pattern, increases photosynthesis, enhances the health of the plant, and reduces wind resistance.","Organic matter retains water in the root zone long enough to be taken up by plants, dramatically reducing overall water use.

We employ integrated pest management (IPM) and best management practices in our turf and landscape installations and maintenance. IPM practices include the treatment of pests (weeds, insects, diseases) only when the damage threshold reaches an unacceptable level. The threshold is set by factors that include: what plant health can tolerate, the aesthetics of the plant and campus, the function and use of the plant or surface (i.e. athletic field, shade from tree), environmental factors, and safety of people and structures. We employ many cultural control measures as well as pesticide and fertilization applications. Whenever possible, we will opt for the cultural practice over the pesticide application, such as core aeration and over seeding a thin turf area instead of grub control and fertilizer where grubs are present, or accepting some leaf damage on a tree infested with Japanese beetles. 
Athletic fields are managed more intensely because of the heavy use they receive. Player safety is also an important consideration in management of athletic fields. Weed growth and grass rooting affects an athlete’s ability to perform as well as foot, ankle and knee safety. Slipping on a weed or shallow rooting of turf grass can injure an athlete or end a career. Proper fertilization and weed control are continually monitored to keep the turf performing at the highest level possible. An IPM approach is employed on athletic fields as well. Because of the intense management, the potential for insect and disease is greater. An important element of IPM is monitoring weather and irrigation. Some pest problems are managed by increasing or decreasing the amount of water the field receives or waiting for the weather to change. Weeds and other pests are generally treated on a “spot treatment” basis as opposed to a broadcast application. Fertilization is performed on a “prescription” type program after a soil test is analyzed annually.","We replace trees on a 2:1 basis, return grass clippings when mowing, compost green/leaf waste and reuse, majority of replacement plants are native species, requiring less water and other inputs, irrigate only high use (athletic) turf.","The grounds team prioritizes native, low maintenance plants and planting strategies to reduce environmental impact.

Facilities has developed five maintenance levels for campus that are based on public appearance and natural priorities for each area.  The central grassy quad of campus is maintained in a more manicured state while other green spaces around campus are maintained using less intensive techniques that allow for more natural mulching, less watering, and greater natural biological control.  We have 278 acres of remote landholdings that are used for research and recreation training.  These properties have a higher action threshold for insect and disease that results in less interaction, but all properties are controlled for invasive species.","The preferred method is to use biological controls or natural substances for controlling pests, plant diseases, and weeds on campus, when natural diversity planning has failed.","For ten years we have been incorporating native species whenever possible in new plantings. Our tree farms are 70% native tree species which will be used to plant new trees on campus.  We have an Ash tree replacement farm that is completely native. We are adding shrub beds that are native shrubs that provide feed for wildlife.  We are currently replacing many drought killed Yew bushes with bayberry, chokeberry, and viburnum varieties. ",We have mulch mowed for 30 years so that the grass clippings get reintroduced into the soil.  We chip 90% of our wood waste to be used as path material at the community garden.  Our leaves are collected and used in the compost at the ISU community garden.,"We use organic fertilizers and a combination of aeration, over-seeding and spot weed treatment to maintain a healthy green turf. This is a low impact method employed to save cost, reduce herbicide usage, and promote soil vigor. The turf in this 75% of campus will have a certain percentage of clover and other broadleaf plants.","
","Our campus irrigation water supply is drawn from ground water throughout the campus through a system of eight(8) wells, and replenished on campus through a system of dry wells, drainage swales and retention areas. Thereby reducing the need for use of the public treated water system.","Our snow and ice removal policies have been revised drastically over the last five years to eliminate CaCl3, reduce the use of rock salt, increased the use of Magnesium and ice-melt blend products. We have also purchased more precise spreading equipment to reduce waste and increase efficiency.  ",,True,http://www.indstate.edu/facilities/grounds/,--

Chemical control is always the last resort.  We have visual thresholds and monitor fungal and insect pest damage.  We try to maintain healthy plants with limited excess nutrient availability.  Only in situations where weather or density will not control an issue do we use chemical control to prevent loss of turf.  No control is used on trees or non-turf plant material.

The 23 acres of grounds on campus are not treated with chemical pesticides.

The Green Oaks Biological field station includes a restored prairie that is burned annually, as well as old-growth and new-growth forests that are managed for biodiversity. The property is carefully managed for invasive species with mechanical methods and occasional targeted herbicide applications.  ","Knox College maintains a heavy focus on sustainable landscaping.  One of the most important aspects of that is plant selection for various locations.  Putting the appropriate plants in selected areas keeps maintenance inputs down.  It allows us to use less water and fertilizer to maintain plant health.  We also do a great deal of plant pruning.  Opening up the canopy allows for better air movement and reduces disease and fungal growth.  Knox uses about 200 cubic yards of mulch annually.  Mulch allows for improved soil moisture without the need for irrigation and helps keep down weeds.  All of the mowing on campus is done to recycle grass clippings.  At no time to we ever bag or remove clippings from the lawn.  This allows fertilizer inputs to remain very low.  The Grounds department also incorporates organic fertilizers into both the plantings and turf as well as PH-changing components like lime and humic acid, to make different nutrients available at certain times of the year and reduce the need for additional fertilizer.  We maintain a very high disease threshold.  Unless key grounds personnel believe the tree, plant, or turf cannot survive the pest, chemical treatment is avoided.","Existing plant material is almost always reused on campus.  There are a few times every year when plants have to be removed due to construction or projects.  When this happens we do our best to transplant the material in another appropriate location.  The removal of plant material is only considered when safety is concerned.  Although not a popular choice, occasional trees must be removed if they are deemed unsafe.  This recommendation is usually given by a certified arborist if it is not immediately obvious.  Most of the plantings on campus consist of a mix or solely of native material.  Plant selection is the most important part of IPM.  There are a few invasive species that we deal with on campus.

The College has intentionally greatly reduced our use of pesticides on campus, and is committed to continuing that trend with a philosophy on the main campus that chemicals be used only as a last resort. 
The College subscribes to the Integrated Pest Management approach to plant pest control. This entails the limiting of vectors for infestation and growth and includes planting resistant species, limiting monocultures, limiting the introduction of pests, and generally providing for a healthy horticultural environment. When pesticides must be applied to protect the campus beauty or the safety of students, the College employs the least toxic chemicals sufficient to meet the need. ","The Middlebury College Campus Master Plan lists as the first two goals 1. Promote Sustainablitily in All College Operations, and 2. Enhance Middlebury’s relationship to the landscape. These two principals guide all of the planning and development at Middlebury, as well as the landscape operations.","Our selection of plant material in new landscape projects is guided by the campus Master Plan, which states: “The diversity of plant species on campus should be increased. Where possible, native plants from the Clayplain Forest, the Transition Hardwood Limestone Forest, and the Oak-Hickory-Hophornbeam Forest palettes should be utilized. These should be supplemented with additional species as appropriate for specific soil conditions and environmental stresses. Invasive introduced species should be avoided. To ensure variety and disease resistance, no more than 30% of trees on the campus should be from one family, no more than 20% should be from one genus, and no more than 10% should be from one species.” Invasive species are not planted on campus, and, where practical, removed from the landscape and natural areas.
 ",We mix our food waste (1 part) with woodchips (3 parts) and horse manure (1 part). Horse manure we acquire from the UVM's Morgan Horse farm for the purpose of composting. Our campus landscape debris is chipped for use in composting. We do end up purchasing wood chips occasionally.,"Our generated compost is spread both on campus proper as well as the athletic fields, and has greatly reduced the need for fertilizer inputs as well as reducing soil compaction. Lawn fertilizers are only used on campus grounds for new seeding establishment, and on the athletic fields on a prescriptive basis. No phosphorus is used in the fertilizer blends.","Locally grown plant material is used for landscape planting, and fertilizers used are blended by a local firm. The majority of plantings consist of native plants to the northeast.","Many areas of the campus utilize bio-retention ponds, swales, rain gardens, and a green roof on a dining hall. The no-mow zones on campus have also proven to be more effective in lessening storm water runoff than the previous lawn. Rain gardens and a green roof were utilized in the construction of the new Squash Center, as well as a green roof on the newest Solar Decathlon house. The campus also has several protected wetlands below campus.","Middlebury College strives to be truly sustainable in snow and ice treatment and removal, not only from an environmental standpoint, but from and economic and social standpoint as well. We have been using a pretreatment of a liquid material called Ice Ban to limit the use of both fuel and ice melters during a snow event. 
We’ve also recently switched from using salt-treated sand to an ice melter. This material is a treated salt that will aid in the melting of snow and ice on sidewalks. The treated material is less corrosive than untreated salt and works at lower temperatures. The use of the snow melt material will provide cleaner sidewalks and roads making for safer travel conditions. Studies show that there is a net environmental benefit to using treated salt compared to sand with salt when used properly. Sand has negative impacts to the environment. These include increased phosphorus loading in adjacent waterways, sedimentation buildup in catch basins, ditches and streams and air pollution issues with particulates becoming airborne. Use of salt will reduce the use of mechanical equipment on Campus, limiting fuel consumption, and less sand use will reduce the amount of spring cleaning necessary to collect residual material.","Middlebury College has a variety of locations that contain class 3 wetlands.

The Plant Operations Department, including the Grounds Department actively engage in the stewardship and practices needed in the commitment to sustainability. We pro-actively participate and prioritize conserving resources, managing waste reduction, reduction of water use, and have a long term perspective towards contributing to the impact on Campus. The use of native plant material in plantings has become a priority, and natural planting areas are utilized whenever possible to enhance the habitat. Turf areas are managed at an acceptable, minimal fertilization level, including recycling of grass clippings, returning them to the soil. IPM is being used to monitor, treat, and enhance plants and lawn areas on campus. We are committed to educating our staff on the reasons behind why these things are done, and encourage new, effective solutions to be brought forward. As a group connected directly to the land, we take that charge seriously and plan to continue to expand our practices and policies.","Muhlenberg Campus has worked to preserve the stately, existing trees across campus. We have established a Tree Advisory Committee to walk the Campus several times annually. We consult with several Certified Arborists to review and aid in tree care and maintenance. Trees that are removed are planned and replacements are required. Tree Protection throughout any construction is required and enforced as well. For any new plantings, the use of native pants is always considered and used when appropriate. Regular scouting for invasive plants is used on the entire 75 acres. Any existing invasive plants are managed and replaced with non-invasive species when possible. See:  Muhlenberg College Landscape Guidelines http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/aboutus/plantops/sustainableinitiatives/","By managing and creating landscapes, the creation of some landscape waste is going to occur. At Muhlenberg we strive to diminish or at least minimize the waste generated. All grass clippings are mulched up and returned to the soil. Leaves that have fallen are collected by the city and composted, collected by our staff and composted or mulched up and returned to the soil.  Landscape materials that are disturbed or removed for construction are re-used in other locations or replaced after completion. As an urban campus, we are limited by space, but are considering in-vessel type composting units to better use the waste material taken. The material taken off- site is through the City of Allentown, and the material goes to their composting site for use by residence, etc.","Healthy soil is an essential part of successful landscapes. Proper management of the campus soils is included in our approach to sustainability. At Muhlenberg College, we work to minimize erosion by minimal disturbance during construction, cover crops on bare soil, and water management on surfaces to direct and decrease any erosion. By channeling the water throughout campus, and containing it, we are able to recharge the groundwater in our immediate Campus property. Our turf and landscape beds are maintained with a low level of fertilization, and very little synthetic fertilizers. We test and treat soil only as needed. Our lawn clippings and a large portion of our leaves are mulched up and returned to the soil for nutrient replenishment through natural materials.","Working in and around Muhlenberg College, the Grounds staff has strived to use environmentally preferable material. During construction, soil is kept on site and re-used. Existing trees and shrubs are kept and utilized whenever feasible. The leaves and grass clippings generated on campus are mulched up and put back into the soil, or placed in composting areas for future use. Rain gardens create aesthetically interesting areas while managing surface water runoff. Through the use of IPM, we have seen a reduction in reliance on chemicals for both turf and landscape beds.","Muhlenberg College has been very pro active in its attempts to reduce water loss and recharge the groundwater. We have some significant Rain Gardens in areas surrounding parking lots that have reduced the amount of surface water lost due to erosion or exiting into the city system. The collection system for a good deal of the south side of campus places the run off in a detention area that is connected to a recharge system. Once the water level reaches a certain height, it automatically pumps the water into piping that then distributes the water across the surface of a natural area to allow it to return to the soil. Any irrigation is monitored closely and not run automatically, but rather adapted to current moisture levels, and turned off if not needed. The irrigation system is serviced regularly to maintain efficiency and effectiveness .These practices, and an awareness of minimizing issues has created a setting that benefits the natural hydrology of the campus land.","Muhlenberg College implements technologies or strategies to reduce the environmental impacts of snow and ice removal.

We use current, comprehensive information on the life cycles of pests and diseases and their interactions with the environment. Cultural practices are employed that enhance plant health, thereby making plant natural defense mechanisms more capable of repelling competitive organisms. Pest tolerance threshold levels have been established and identified for pests and diseases. Regular monitoring is done to determine how pest levels relate to thresholds. The IPM system is used to manage pests and disease in the most economical means with the least possible hazard to people, property, and the environment. The Grounds department explores all available strategies before using pesticides. When pesticides are used, the least toxic is used. Grounds uses organic garlic extract to repel insects. We also use IPM with regards to pest and critter control with live trap and removal.

Organic fertilizer is used on academic and residential turf. The material is applied at one quarter the recommended rate. Although synthetic fertilizer has been used, low rates resulted in minimal chemical salt content in the soil. Grounds uses glyphosate broad-spectrum herbicide to maintain maintenance strips around vertical elements in the landscape.","The Grounds department is one of the most sustainable areas on campus. The head of Grounds attends periodic training and development sessions to ensure that Oberlin is ahead of the curve. The department has devised a low intensity turf maintenance program. Low fertility levels, no irrigation, and minimum use of machines for line trimming (weed eating), aeration, and over seeding keep fuel use to a minimum. Summer heat and drought puts the majority of turf into a month-long state of dormancy, eliminating the need to mow. Native plants are featured in several prominent locations on campus. Aggressive invasive species are removed. The conversion of turf to meadow is a fuel savings opportunity for the Grounds Department. Oberlin's Grounds Department worked with the City of Oberlin to change ordinances governing grass to allow for natural landscaping. Grounds has converted fine-cut turf to wildflower meadows at eight locations on campus totaling seven acres. Mowing efficiency has also been examined to reduce fuel usage. Bed shapes have been increased to make curvilinear lines that allow faster mowing speeds. The Grounds Department uses landscape management categories to govern the level of maintenance provided to various parts of the campus landscape to ensure proper attention is given to each part of campus, while striving to be as sustainable as possible.

For example, the University's Office of the Physical Plant has recently made an effort to remove invasive species from an area called Hort Woods, in North Campus, and began reintroducing native plant-life in the area.  The Arboretum Ecological Restoration Group organizes work sessions in which volunteers help to stop the spread of nonnative shrubs such as honeysuckle, privet, and multiflora rose in the understory of the Hartley Wood, an historic woodlot in the Arboretum. These efforts have now been extended into other areas of the Arboretum in Big Hollow.  ","Leaves, plant debris, brush and logs are collected from campus landscape maintenance.

The wood from Elm trees removed on campus due to disease or failing health is salvaged and repurposed into furniture and other products that are sold.  OPP partners with the Alumni Association on this project.  It results in a much higher reuse of the wood instead of mulch.  Proceeds from the sale of products are split between OPP and the Alumni Association.  OPP’s share goes to the Tree Replacement Endowment which is used to purchase and plant new trees on campus.  Close to $500,000 of Elms Collection items have been sold in the 3+ years the program has existed. 

 


In FY 2013, Penn State composted almost 3,000 tons of animal manure, crop and food residuals, ground pallet wood, leaves and plant debri, offal, drywall and soiled cardboard/paper to produce 1,040 cubic yards of compost. Almost 1,800 tons of brush, logs and bark produced 3,028 cubic yards of mulch. 


Since 1997 Penn State’s Organic Materials Processing and Education Center (OMPEC) has demonstrated continuous growth in quantity, quality and variety of organic materials captured, processed and utilized at the University Park Campus. The OMPEC site is operated as a captive facility. The primary inputs diverted from the waste stream are pre and post-consumer food residuals, leaves, landscape debris and lab animal cage wastes.  Farm animal manure and crop residues are used to compliment the various feedstocks to create an optimal compost mix and to produce value added end products demanded by users.

The OMPEC facility fulfills operational needs of the University, provides research opportunities and serves as a model facility for the public and private organics processing sector to observe and learn organics processing procedures.  Each year classes in Environmental Resource Management, Horticulture, Agro Ecology and Ag Engineering visit the site to learn about environmental design, production and equipment.  

The program is a collaboration between the College of Agricultural Sciences, Housing and Food Services, Hospitality Services and the Office of Physical Plant. The project has parallel goals of responding to the needs of handling organic residuals generated from within the university and enhancing teaching, research and extension/outreach programs of a land-grant university. The Office of Physical Plant coordinates collection and delivery of food residuals and the College of Agricultural Sciences is responsible for compost production.","An alternative to round-up herbicide is horticultural vinegar. Alternatives to conventional fertilizers used include general purpose fertilizer that include 32% organic sources of nitrogen, organic specialty turf fertilizer, compost from Penn State's OMPEC facility, tree root zone renovation and bio-stimulants that increase the biological activity in the soils to unlock the nitrogen and other nutrients present. ","Penn State uses compost and mulch from its own composting facility. In FY2013, this facility produced 3,028 cu. yds of mulch and 1,040 cu yds of compost. Penn State uses compost as nutrients for its flowers and shrubs and some of it to topdress its lawns. ","The University's storm water program promotes the use of conservation design practices that preserve and use natural critical hydrologic areas to minimize the impact on the environment. Penn State monitors more than two dozen storm water facilities continuously and makes changes or improvements to them as required. The University is always installing new and innovative facilities to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of runoff from its campuses. 
The University uses bioretention as a method of treating storm water by pooling water on the surface and allowing filtering and settling of suspended solids and sediment at the mulch layer, prior to entering the plant/soil/microbe complex media for infiltration and pollutant removal. Rain gardens or bioretention techniques are used to accomplish water quality improvement and water quantity reduction. 
At University Park, numerous hard armored conveyance swale types have been used around campus. Interlocking concrete block swales, concrete swales, fabri-form concrete mates, gabion basket, reno mattresses, and the more common rip rap stone are some examples of the stone swale styles used. The University owns numerous grass lined swales, however, these swales cannot adequately provide long term stability for high flow or slope channels so stone swales are also used on campus.
The UP campus currently has five buildings with green roofs: the Forestry Building, the vegetable cellar, the Dickinson School of Law, the Health Services Building, and the Millennium Science Complex building. The Penn State Center for Green Roof Research is located at the University Park Campus in the College of Agricultural Sciences, and the University has created a Storm Water Management magazine describing its initiatives and facilities. ","The Office of Physical Plant exercises judgment when applying salt for winter deicing and anti-icing materials in an effort to provide for public safety, yet considers the environmental impacts of the materials used.  Currently most materials used are granular.  Discretion is used in only applying these materials at the proper times to gain the optimal impact, using the least possible material.  Training occurs annually to assure that proper amounts are applied for proper coverage patterns, avoiding over-application.  Mechanical spreaders are calibrated annually, and with the large trucks used for roads and parking lots, liquid brine is sprayed on the salt as it crosses the spinner for spreading on the surface.  This reduces bounce of the salt, keeping it on the hard surfaces, and enhances the melting capability of the rock salt, allowing less to be used than in dry granular applications in past years.
 
NAAC (sodium acetate) is used on parking structures to reduce exposure to corrosion, but it also had the environmental benefit of better properties to biodegrade, and is considered relatively harmless to aquatic life. 
 
OPP is switching to the use of granular magnesium chloride for about 1/4 of campus landscape use as a pilot, with a goal to eliminate sodium and calcium based salts from use at building entrances and campus walkways. Additionally, one area will pilot the use of brine as a fully liquid application.  Magnesium chloride is recognized as causing less of an impact on plant materials.  Planning is also taking place to convert to a liquid application for roads and parking lots to provide more controlled application to the target surfaces, again reducing total use of salts, and corresponding impact to plant growth and ground water.","There are no certified or legally protected areas on campus.  There are areas designated in the campus master plan as environmentally sensitive, including four Natural Heritage Inventory Biological Diversity Areas.

Pitzer is committed to the sustainable management of pests through the use of sound Integrated Pest Management (IPM) that focuses on eliminating pest access to food, water and shelter in our campus buildings and grounds.  This is accomplished through the use of reduced risk pest control methods with a preference for non-chemical control measures.  Decisions concerning whether or not pesticides should be applied in a given situation will be based on a review of all available options.  When it is determined that a pesticide must be used in order to meet pest management objectives, the least-hazardous material, adequate for the job, will be chosen. Sanitation, pest exclusion and habitat modification are essential to long-term pest mitigation.  Buildings will be regularly cleaned and repaired in order to prevent pest infestations.  All facilities and grounds will be maintained to be free of trash, debris and clutter.  Ornamental plants, turf and desirable grasses will be managed in a manner that limits animal, plant and microbial pest attraction.  

Core components of Pitzer’s IPM include:
-Identify pest species 
-Estimate pest populations and compare to established action thresholds
-Conduct a site evaluation and select the most appropriate management strategy 
-Assess effectiveness of pest management
-Keep appropriate records
","Guidelines for the Pitzer College Landscape

Campus landscaping should reflect our climate and geological setting. Geologically, Pitzer is situated on an alluvial fan at the foot of some of the steepest mountains in the world. Biologically, we are at the intersection of the mountainous chaparral community with the coastal sage scrub of the valley. In a broader sense, we are part of the arid and semi-arid American Southwest that embraces New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Utah and Nevada, as well as southern California and Baja. Climatically, we live in one example of a ""Mediterranean"" climate (mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers), which we share with the countries of the Mediterranean rim and parts of southern Africa, Australia, and Chile.
Geographically, we can communicate a sense of place by keeping the campus open to a view of the mountains; geologically, by incorporating granitic boulders, cobbles, and decomposed granite into the built landscape; floristically, by preserving remnants of the natural landscape and by using native plants both individually and in their natural patterns of association.
The notion of ""native"" plants is not as simple or restrictive as is sometimes assumed; it is more like a multi-dimensional set of concentric circles. For example, there are plants native to the San Antonio Wash; plants native to the alluvial scrub ecosystems of southern California; plants native to southern California generally; plants native to the American Southwest; and plants appropriate to this place because they are native to one or another of the world's climatically ""Mediterranean"" areas. Examples of things that are not meaningful to do here include installing English gardens, planting rows of eastern trees, and introducing redwoods under the guise of ""California natives.""

The campus should be designed to conserve water. Although Claremont is not desert (less than ten inches average rainfall), it is semi-arid (sixteen inches average rainfall). It can support endless green lawns and rows of exotic street trees only by taking water from other regions. This long-term situation is punctuated by periodic drought, protests from the water colonies, spasms of water rationing, and rising water prices. Pitzer's landscape needs to move further in the direction of ""xeriscape"" (landscaping appropriate for dry climates), which involves such things as more efficient irrigation, limitation of water-consumptive turfgrass to areas where it is needed for specific functions (e.g., playing fields), and the user of ""drought-tolerant or ""water-wise"" plant material.
As the new master plan is implemented, there will be more turfgrass (and therefore more water use) because there will be more playing fields. In this situation, we need to choose our varieties of turfgrass wisely, design our irrigation systems carefully, offset the new water use by reducing water use in other parts of the campus (for example, by converting some grassy areas to less water-consumptive vegetation), and explore ways of reusing irrigation water that runs off playing fields and parking lots. In order to monitor and control water use, metering is essential for specific buildings and landscape areas, but until 1991 there was only one water meter for the entire College. Two meters were added as part of the East Mesa project, and this practice needs to continue as new buildings are built and portions of the campus are newly landscaped or altered. In addition, the College should investigate the state of the art with regard to rain gauges and moisture sensors to see if they should be included as an integral part of a water-conserving irrigation system. As for plant material, there is a great overlap (though by no means a complete correspondence) between the xeriscape principle and the principle of using native plants. The general use of xeriscape does not preclude the occasional use of some water-consumptive native plants if these are grouped on separate irrigation lines and do not dominate the landscape. More precise guidelines will need to be developed after the city of Claremont adopts its version of the Model Landscape Ordinance mandated by AB 325, developed by the Department of Water Resources, and currently being adapted for Claremont by former Pitzer student Gerald Taylor.

The campus landscape should be educational. It can communicate a sense of place and demonstrate how people can live more within the limits of their region's resources. It can provide an environment conducive to learning by providing outdoor nooks, both sunny and shady, where members of the College community can read, meditate, write, and converse. It is also possible to display some of the different dimensions of nativity in instructive ways that provide variety and support the College's commitment to intercultural understanding. For example, instead of simply mixing Australian, southern African, and southern Californian plantings, we could have an Australian and/or a southern African garden, perhaps at one or more of the new buildings. A sign and labels, or a brochure, could interpret these gardens to us and to campus visitors. A different garden might focus on Native American uses of southern California plants, while another might highlight introduced plants that had, over time, become ""naturalized."" 
Campus plantings should be interesting and attractive, with attention to shape, texture, and color. More attention should be paid to planting for the long run (e.g., trees that will be magnificent specimens after many years). More attention should be paid to plantings that bloom over the seasons, instead of just in the summer when the main College program is on vacation.

The landscape should help unify the campus, which will increasingly contain buildings of different styles and periods. Unity might be accomplished partly by using certain native plant species as ""theme"" trees and shrubs in different parts of the campus, especially at points of entrance, exit, and transition. Certain associations of plants might also become a distinctive Pitzer characteristic. In addition, proper landscaping can soften the intrusive mediocrity of some of the older buildings, as through the use of climbing vines on blank walls.

Grounds management should emphasize ecological understanding of soil development and maintenance, biotechnical cycling, species and age diversity, and structural and physiological adaptation of the vegetation. It should shun the practice of planting monocultures of nutrient- and water-demanding, exotic vegetation on nutrient-poor, rapidly-draining soils. Such practices create drought- and pest-prone landscaping, which we then ""force"" with increased water, fertilizer, and pesticides.

Finally, and equal in importance to the other goals, landscaping should reflect the spirit of the College. This spirit is not expressed by the imperialism of imposing rigid, geometric forms--or alien plant species--upon the natural world, but by a more ""naturalistic"" style that is informal, diverse, and respectful of natural patterns and native species.","The College grounds are predominantly landscaped with drought tolerant plants, including cacti and succulents, as well as native plants.  ","All green waste from campus operations is either composted on campus or picked up by the City of Claremont, where it is composted and used as mulch.","Grounds management should emphasize ecological understanding of soil development and maintenance, biotechnical cycling, species and age diversity, and structural and physiological adaptation of the vegetation.

Such practices create drought- and pest-prone landscaping, which we then ""force"" with increased water, fertilizer, and pesticides.

To minimize use of chemicals and prevent pests from becoming a threat, Grounds must inspect and monitor outdoor facilities, sanitize and manage pest attractants, engage in structural maintenance, and evaluate the need for pest control. If the need for chemical controls is established, Grounds can only use substances in targeted locations on targeted species. All substances must meet San Francisco's Tier 3 hazard criteria for a least toxic pesticide, and if cleaning products are used, they must be in accordance with the College's Green Cleaning Standards. Pesticides are acceptable only if they are used in self-contained baits and placed in inaccessible locations. Indoor management of pests follows similar procedures. The EPA IPM guidelines are equivalent, as Pomona's Standards require evaluation, targeted application, prevention, and guidelines for the selection and application of pest control substances.","Pomona College has committed to sustainability. What might this mean for landscape and open space design? First, designers must consider sustainability both in terms of renovation projects as well as new construction. Sustainability, as suggested above, is a critical issue that must become an integral part of the design process. 

Sustainable landscape design may assess basic and practical issues, which include evaluating the use or application of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides; reducing or eliminating portions of planted areas to conserve water; use of the most efficient irrigation systems; and establishing composting programs for organic wastes. But a complete and workable definition of sustainability for Pomona College must also address
what has been described as “aesthetic sustainability.” This includes visual appeal and harmony, combined with ecological integrity, issues of human well-being, and place identity.

Considerations of aesthetic sustainability at Pomona College include recognition that the value of historic, mature landscapes such as those of Marston Quadrangle must be balanced with desires to solve current dilemmas such as reduction of water use. There must also be a recognition that newer is not necessarily better, and that the most sustainable landscape may be the one that already exists. This is quite clear in the more
undisturbed regions of the Wash, but is equally true of the edges of Marston Quadrangle.
Composed of traditionally high water use plant material such as coast redwood and camellias, the maturity of this landscape causes it to be classified as a relatively low water use zone.

Truly sustainable landscape design balances a variety of resources, including water, stormwater runoff, historic value, and aesthetic character. A sustainable landscape cannot conserve one resource, while ignoring others. Water conservation, for instance, is a critical issue for Southern California. However, water use reduction should not occur at the expense of the beautiful and usable spaces that make Pomona the “College in a
Garden.” We must preserve historical landscape character and work toward ecological sustainability at the same time. The positive environmental effects of landscapes, including oxygen production, solar control, heat mitigation, and stormwater runoff
control and filtration must be maintained and maximized.

In addition, sustainability efforts at Pomona College should always be an educational process for the campus community and for visitors. Wherever appropriate, landscape design should incorporate interpretive graphics describing sustainability efforts. 

When considering issues of sustainability in designing projects at Pomona College, site specificity and context must be at the forefront of design decisions. Sustainability must coexist with existing, mature, and historic open spaces.

Whether designing new spaces or renovating older ones, understanding maintenance issues should be considered an integral part of the design process. The project designer must proactively engage the college’s Office of Facilities and Campus Services, which includes the Grounds, Maintenance, Planning, and Sustainability Departments, from the earliest phases of design.

This will provide the campus staff with the opportunity to share with the designer their special requirements and institutional knowledge as well as standards specific to Pomona College. Issues such as material selection, initial planning densities, equipment limitations, etc., can be shared and mutually agreed upon early in the design process. At the same time, the design intent and long-range aesthetic expectations can be agreed upon and later codified for use by maintenance staff in the future.

The Office of Facilities and Campus Services is the source for all campus standards with regard to irrigation, site lighting, and site furnishings and is an invaluable resource for points of communication with other campus departments and organizations.

Once the project is complete, it shall be the responsibility of the project designer to provide written guidelines for specific maintenance requirements and expectations as discussed above.","The Pomona College Open Space and Landscape Guidelines, approved in May 2010, identify ""the use of California native plants and their cultivars whenever appropriate"" as a major design issue for sustainability in the College landscape.

The campus also contains a dedicated natural preserve known as ""the Wash"" with a variety of species of native flora.","All green waste from campus operations is either composted on-site or picked up by the City of Claremont, where it is composted and used as mulch.","Pomona College no longer purchases or uses synthetic fertilizers on our grounds.

Aspects of the plan include using the least toxic chemical pesticides; minimum use of chemicals; and the use of chemicals only in targeted locations and only for targeted species.","The Princeton Campus Plan embraces the opportunity to integrate the campus more fully into the local natural landscape through restoration efforts and natural plantings. Robust natural landscapes provide pervious surfaces, thereby improving groundwater recharge, preventing soil and stream bank erosion, and protecting nearby surface waters.
 
The Campus Plan includes a series of design improvements, such as strategic woodland plantings in degraded areas and stream restoration. Historically, Princeton has irrigated minimally on campus, instead relying on robust plantings that require little maintenance, chemical input, and watering. This approach is a historically sustainable one, requiring far less fossil fuel input than extensive annual or sensitive specialty plantings. While limited specialty plantings are an integral part of the campus character, Princeton will maintain its traditional approach to general landscaping. Princeton emphasizes: preserving native soils, increasing pervious surfaces, installing plantings adapted to the local climate and soil types that require minimal maintenance, favoring organic approaches, and irrigating as an exception rather than a rule.","All University plantings are selected for their appropriateness in Princeton, New Jersey's hardiness zone, as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Additionally, the University chooses plantings by considering soil and watering requirements, as well as its proven ability to flourish in this campus environment. When possible, Princeton protects and uses existing vegetation on campus and in its natural areas.
 
When possible, the University uses natural methods to control weeds, insects and fungi. An example of this is the University's integrated pest management program: periodically the University releases a variety of beneficial insects and larvae.","Nearly 100 percent of the leaves and landscape trimmings collected on campus are composted. Since 2008, an average annual volume of approximately 4,500 cubic yards of ""green waste"" were composted — enough leaves and trimmings to create a one foot thick cover for nearly three acres.","Depending on the nutrient needs of the soil, the soil is amended, and with compost when possible. Natural materials such as sand and clay are also being incorporated into fertilizers, reducing the amount of synthetic material per application.  ","Whenever possible, Grounds staff uses natural fertilizers on the University's 635 acres of campus, such as tree tea and mulch. However, weather conditions sometimes require the use of synthetic fertilizers.","Princeton’s Stormwater Management Plan comprises of a two pronged approach. First, campus-wide strategies include enhancing existing systems, constructing new local systems, and implementing landscape-based restoration projects. Major projects include stream restorations along Washington Road, underground stormwater facilities below the Bedford and other new athletic fields, and enhancements to the existing east basin facility.
 
Additionally, since 2008, Princeton has implemented sustainable design principles to minimize adverse effects in new development projects. Sites selected for new development projects have respected the environment by protecting sensitive natural resources, buffer zones, forests, and other ecologically sensitive areas. Whenever possible, new projects have been built on sites that are already developed and make them “greener” by creating new green space. All projects have demonstrated innovative site design techniques, such as integrating stormwater within the landscape for treatment, and promoting infiltration and rainwater reuse.","The University completes pre-storm treatment on campus to better prepare the campus before snow.

The roads/parking product is a combination of 50% “Eco-Sand” and 50% Sodium Chloride (purchased in bulk). The walkway product is called “Lighting” (purchased in 50 lb bags). The Director of Facilities, in partnership with the Chemistry Department, did extensive research before purchasing the “Eco-Sand”, which is an inexpensive coal slag or cinder material and a by-product of electrical generation activities at power plants and found that it met foundational criteria (e.g., less corrosive on our equipment, concrete walkways, asphalt paving, and adjacent landscaping and environment; effective at low temperatures; locally available).

The Buildings & Grounds Department constantly monitors the weather conditions utilizing local media, government websites, and close communication with the Purdue Airport.  The preparedness phase integrates communication and announcement of snow fleet mobilization with the Purdue Police Department, Purdue Fire Department, and the Purdue Airport.

Once the 2”-3” snow accumulation threshold is anticipated or has been met, the snow fleet mobilizes.  Rather than using harsh or corroding chemicals, the product used as a deicing agent is a brine and beet juice solution.

Specifically, Rice has outlined its own mission for IPM, and follows the IPM strategies for turfgrass and ornamentals that were developed by Texas A&M’s Department of Entomology and published in 2014. ","Although there is no formal plan in place, Rice’s Facilities Engineering & Planning department goes to great lengths to uphold the standards of sustainable landscape management.  The following are a number of the strategies employed by the university: 
(1) Pest control is based on the IPM principles (outlined above) to minimize chemical use and toxicity in managing pests. 

(2) Grasscycling: Instead of collecting and disposing of grass clippings, Rice employs “grasscycling” by leaving grass clippings on the lawn when mowing.  These clippings decompose and return valuable nutrients to the soil.  Furthermore, any leaf and branch material that is gathered is kept on-campus and reused.  

(3) Rice utilizes Hou-Actinite, a recycled sewage sludge derived from activated waste water.  It is a naturally nutrient-rich, slow-release organic fertilizer.  The slow release characteristics reduce its risk of burning and leaching from over watering. 

(4) The Arbor Day Foundation has designated Rice University as a ""Tree Campus USA"" for taking care of its more that 4,600 trees.  In order to earn the Tree Campus USA recognition, Rice upholds three core standards of tree care, including a campus tree advisory committee; a campus tree-care plan; and a dedicated annual expenditures for the campus tree-care plan. 

(5) Rice University itself is a designated arboretum, The Lynn R. Lowrey Arboretum.  The Lynn R. Lowrey Arboretum is a teaching and research resource of Rice University.  
The Lowrey Arboretum consists of a collection of woody plants dispersed throughout the Rice University campus that represents native and introduced species suitable to the soils and climate of the Houston area.  The Lowrey Arboretum has developed several projects on campus that employ native or appropriately adapted species, and furthermore the Arboretum Committee provides an advisory service for landscape design for new buildings on the Rice campus.    ","Rice’s primary mission is to maintain the environment and landscape that currently exists on campus.  When Rice has plans for new construction, there is an extensive process for designing the new landscape. Over the years, Rice has had a significant contribution in this design process, consulting with the various architects, landscape architects, and project managers to emphasize the importance of using well-adapted plant materials and native species when appropriate.  
Furthermore, through a campus tree-care protection plan and re-location expenditures, Rice’s commitment to protecting its existing tree population (comprised of more than 4,600 trees) is commendable.  

Moreover, Rice itself is designated as the Lynn R. Lowery Arboretum, and as such, there is an Arboretum Committee that advises new projects with regards to the landscape selections.   Although the Arboretum Committee doesn’t have the ability to reject a design, it certainly reviews the designs and gives its opinions.  Overall, the committee tries to promote native plants and plant species that are well-adapted to Houston’s climate, as well as identify appropriate species that will add to the biodiversity on Rice’s campus.  In the Harris Gully Natural Area, for example, a number of invasive plants have been removed in an effort to encourage native species and restore the space to its original ecology.  The Texas wildflowers that are sown in the area each spring have thrived, making this location stunning and diverse.  
In other parts of campus, native grasses and drought-resistant plants have been used, including on top of Rice’s green roofs.  

In instances when construction impacts trees, Rice often will move trees to new locations rather than just cut them down. ","In terms of day-to-day activity, the Rice University grounds committee employs “grasscycling” techniques, meaning that they don’t actively remove grass clippings, leaves or branch trimmings.  Instead, they try to recycle all of these materials on-campus.  

In certain circumstances, the University also has certain procedures set in place to ensure that landscape materials are properly disposed of.  For example, in 2008 when Hurricane Ike hit, there was a major loss of tree limbs.  In this instance, Rice had to hire contractors to help with the removal process.  Although there was a lot of wood chipping done on-site, a large amount had to be shipped to off-site facilities.  Rice ensured that the companies recycled this material.  ","Rice recycles its grass and leaf clippings so as to allow them to nourish the soil.  Furthermore, Rice's use of Hou-Actinite to fertilize its grounds eliminates the use of inorganic fertilizers and chemicals. ","(1) Rice's grounds department uses locally produced mulch for its landscaping purposes.  

(2) The large majority of Rice's plant materials comes from within a 100-150 mile radius of the campus so as to reduce the transportation costs and thereby reduce the environmental impacts. ","Water is a major concern on Rice's campus, and the University does what it can to maintain the integrity of the natural hydrology of the campus: 
Although the grounds crew typically uses potable water for irrigation, under certain circumstances, such as during the drought of 2011, Rice was able to tap into de-watering wells located in the basements of certain buildings on-campus. Essentially, water from these wells is constantly pumped out of the ground to keep the basements dry; thus, during droughts, this water can be used for irrigation.  
Rice is also committed to protecting the Harris Gully Natural Area.  The project of the Lowrey Arboretum is a remnant of a riparian woodland on the banks of Harris Gully.  Through plantings of native grasses, wildflowers, trees, and shrubs, Rice seeks to create a replica of a natural system once widespread in the Houston area.  A detention pond is located in the Harris Gully Natural Area, and serves to reduce campus flooding. 
",Not applicable - Houston does not receive any appreciable amount of snow or ice.,"Rice University is a designated arboretum, The Lynn R. Lowrey Arboretum.  An initial key area of focus for the Arboretum was to restore the ""Harris Gully Natural Area"" which is where the old Harris Gully flowed across campus.  This natural area is, and will remain a protected area on campus throughout the University's growth.  In fact, the University master plan even suggests expansion of this natural area in order to create a sort of greenway that follows the path of the original Harris Gully.",True,http://sustainability.rice.edu/Content.aspx?id=2419,"The Lynn R.

Extreme care is taken to meet the expectations of the campus community to live, work and play in this urban oasis.

Saint Louis University's Grounds Department implemented an IPM plan that covers 55 acres of the campus landscape. The plan covers all methods of pest control and specifies that the preferable methods, when needed, should be the least toxic and damaging to the grounds.","Saint Louis University has a social obligation to preserve and conserve our valuable natural landscape resources. We believe a beautiful campus environment assists in the overall experience for our students, faculty, and staff. This keen awareness of our impact on the campus community helps define our sustainability practices. Consequently, the Grounds Department emphasizes native plant installation on all new projects. This practice was implemented on July 1, 2010. The target goal for native plant material on each new project is 50%. 

Perennial flower beds on campus feature a variety of native plants that include: Purple Coneflower, Carex, Heliopsis, Blazing Star, Bee Balm, Turtlehead and Rudbeckia. Other types of native plants used on campus include: Blue Wild Indigo, Aster, Coreopsis, Purple Coneflower, Rattlesnake Master, Wild Bergamot, Yellow Gray Coneflower, Goldenrod and Golden Alexander.

In accordance with the IPM plan, visual monthly inspections for Chinch bug, sod webworm, billbug and/or other destructive turf pests will be conducted. Application of insecticides to turf areas will be limited in an effort to preserve populations of beneficial insects and nematodes. Widespread application of broadleaf herbicides will not be performed unless weed species have invaded greater than 10% of the entire turf area. Spot application may be done on small areas on a needed basis. Pesticides for turf disease will only be performed if evidence of disease has been found and significant areas (10-15% of the total turf area) of permanent damage are found. To preserve beneficial & predatory insects, pesticides will be applied only on an as needed basis, meaning more than 10% damage or defoliation to ornamental plants. Priority will be given to those pesticides having the lowest toxicity and whenever possible, biological pest control – predatory insects, beneficial nematodes, and microbial pesticides - will be used.   Insect and disease resistant plant varieties will be selected for planting in any flowerbed and/or formal landscaping areas.","Beginning on July 1, 2010 the Saint Louis University Grounds Department implemented a composting and mulching practice which includes all landscaping waste including but not limited to grass, leaves, and other landscape related debris. This practice has led to an 85% reduction in disposal and landfill fees over previous fiscal years.  In FY15, approximately 191 tons of yard waste was composted on site.
 
Difficult to compost items, such as tree stumps, are transported by Waste Management to the Milam landfill. There the yard waste is put through a composting process that allows them to use it for an additive to the soil cover. It helps prevent erosion and is great for growing grass in sandy soils at the site. In FY15, 0 tons of yard waste was hauled away for composting.","Organic fertilizers are used in flower beds and athletic fields. We make four applications of fertilizer a year, of which 3 are organic.

In accordance with the IPM plan, soil samples will be collected prior to application of any fertilizer or pesticides. Annual soil samples will also be taken to assess soil fertility & pH. Proper soil pH & fertility will help to prevent many turf-grass diseases & promote plant vigor, thereby reducing the occurrence of insect and weed invasions. Amendments will be made to the soil as recommended by the soil analysis reports. 

When practical, organic fertilizers will be used, otherwise, fertilizer with 50% slow release nitrogen shall be used. Grass clippings will remain on turf wherever possible and allowed to degrade to help increase soil organic matter and promote beneficial earthworm activity.","SLU's Grounds Department makes use of the on-site yard waste compost to fertilize campus grounds in a closed loop fashion, using approximately 191 tons this past year.",n/a,"Saint Louis University recognizes the impact of snow and ice removal on the grounds and therefore follows a detailed policy for snow and ice removal operations.

            Second to habitat destruction, invasive plants are the greatest threat to biological diversity today. Not only do invasive species pose as a significant ecological threat, California alone spends eighty million dollars every year fighting invasives that have now become a significant economic complication. Invasive plants increase the potential for wildfire, displace native plants that form the basis of productive ecosystems, and even clog valuable waterways. When invasive species establish in a new location, the pathogens, predators, and other limiting agents that control the population’s growth in its endemic region are not present. This renders an exposed region extremely vulnerable to the introduced species. It is estimated that roughly half of California’s invasive species are of horticultural origin. Supporting nurseries that are taking a leap in the direction of non-invasive gardening is an imperative to winning the battle against invasive ornamental plants.
Alternatives to Fertilizers

            The gardener’s role is to aid the soil food web and provide microbes with a steady food source to keep the immobilization/mobilization cycle continuing. The following techniques are employed to ensure the health of a well-balanced soil food web:

1) Composting: Decaying plant matter is rich in mineral nutrients and active microorganisms.  Compost provides a “microbial boost” to soils.

http://eartheasy.com/grow_compost.html

 

2) Teas: In addition to traditional composting, it is becoming increasingly popular to create liquid compost teas. Applying the solution to soil boosts the microorganism count significantly and drastically revives the life in soil. These teas are often sprayed on foliage and defend the plant by competing against harmful pathogens.

http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/airwaste/wm/recycle/tea/tea1.htm

 

3) Mulching: Various sources of plant matter (wood chips, leaves, etc.) is applied to the soil surface providing moisture retention, weed inhibition, and the soil food web with an energy source. Mulch also contains nutrients that enter the immobilization/mobilization process and enhance soil fertility. This process takes place over time and acts as a time-release nutrient source!

http://www.ladybug.uconn.edu/factsheets/tp_05_mulchbasics.html
 

            Aside from the economic and environmental impact of introduced species, fighting the battle against invasive plants has a number of benefits for the gardener. Native plants are adapted to our climate, thrive in a variety of soils and require minimal care outside the realm of the soil food web (Section III & IV). California’s Mediterranean climate (wet winters followed by long, dry summers) has imposed a severe selection pressure on our plants. Species found in our state thrive in these rough conditions that demand a great deal of resources for non-natives to survive in. In addition, planting natives from you local region encourages native fauna to visit your landscape, improving your garden’s habitat value.","SF State's Grounds department is cultivating a landscape that  maintains urban biodiversity, requires no irrigation with drinking water, and exports no green waste.","SF State fosters a healthy, aesthetically pleasing, sustainable, and environmentally friendly campus that functions as a great place to study, work and live. Our ultimate aim is to provide a landscape which is self-regenerating and off the energy grid.
The SF State campus also contains a significant urban forest, planted in a network of windbreaks, bird nesting zones, and sheltered courtyards. Renovation and renewal of the forest is directed to maintain the special forest character of the campus, while supporting a more complex web of ecological relationships, increasing seasonal highlights, and shaping new spaces for social interaction and quiet contemplation.

Our campus has decided to allow unused lawns to grow out and set seed. Although the traditional lawns look nice, they are labor intensive and take up valuable space. By not regularly trimming the grass our schools saves both energy and water. These lawn meadows provide areas of relief for birds and small mammals to hid from predators, forage and obtain nesting material","SF State composts 100% of its green waste through our campus waste hauler, Recology. The campus also operates a decomposer garden, which is used for Mushroom Taxonomy classes to inoculate logs and grow mushrooms. This garden provides a space where logs and pine needles can decompose down naturally by fungus, arthropods and bacteria. This process of breaking down orangic material releases needed nutrients back in to the environment. ","Employing the Soil Food Web

            For numerous reasons, fertilizers have been a hot topic in recent decades. Agricultural processes are now common interest and techniques employed by industry are under public notice. For good reasons, people are now taking an interest in how plants are grown! The term organic is commonly thrown around and has various meanings among different groups. In the gardening world, one who practices organic techniques utilizes resources derived from natural sources (compost, wood chips, worm castings, guano, rock phosphate, bone meal, seaweed, etc.) rather than industrially processed fertilizers (Haber-Bosch process, and Odda Process) that have miraculously ensured access to crops for our steadily growing population.  A respect for the soil food web is the foundation of many organic gardening techniques. We know that plants hold and accumulate nutrients in their cells throughout their lifespan. When a plant dies, what becomes of these essential nutrients? Eventually soilborne microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protists, etc.) consume this decaying plant matter. These nutrients become locked up inside the bodies of decomposers in a process called immobilization. Subsequently the decomposers themselves die, later consumed by other decomposers, or are eaten by larger organisms, like nematodes and earthworms that produce nutrient rich excrements in a process called mobilization.  This continual process of immobilization (locked up) and mobilization (released) of mineral nutrients create the fertile soils that yield healthy and nourished plants. The beauty of this cycle is that nutrients are held within the soil. Unfortunately, rather than being immobilized, synthetic fertilizers drain through the soil and leach into the water table producing an adverse effect on the surrounding ecosystem. In addition, synthetic fertilizers destroy the soil food web. These fertilizers are incessantly mobilized, unable to be taken up by microorganisms, and form an osmotic potential between the microbial cell and the nutrient solution. This osmotic potential ruptures the walls of these single celled organisms voiding the soil of life.","SF State's Grounds department purchases plants and equipment that support land being water efficient, supportive of wildlife and pollinators, and minimizing pesticides. Irrigation equipment supports our efforts to reduce campus water usage. ","Our flagship rainwater harvesting system collects 12,000 gallons of rainwater each year from the roof of the Recycling Center and can be observed from the northeast side of the parking garage. We are utilizing an adjacent 630 watt solar array to power a pump to irrigate over 6,000 square feet of native plants until they become established. We will then redirect the water to other new landscaping projects.

Our first rain garden installation collects about 60,000 gallons each year from the adjacent Corporation Yard warehouse roof which can be viewed from the northwest side of the garage, or up close from North St State or St. Drive. This rain garden was planted with native plants that are both drought tolerant, and can handle short periods of inundation of water in the winter.

These methods reduce, filter, and slow stormwater runoff, recharging the groundwater and lessening the burden on our sewer system. By mimicking natural watershed processes, we are helping to conserve a precious resource and mitigate some of the ecological damage done by our urbanized society.",,,--,http://sustain.sfsu.edu/landscape,--

Wood chip mulch. Branches from pruning and tree removals will be chipped on site. A three to four inch layer of wood chips will be used to suppress most emerging weed seeds. The “soil to wood chip interface,” where many dormant weed seeds potentially reside, is depleted of available nitrogen during the breakdown of the high carbon content of the wood chips, further helping to suppress weeds.

Sheet mulching.  The goal of sheet mulching is to provide additional, temporary weed suppression when renovating or planting a landscape. This method will be used where appropriate in the landscape. A layer of cardboard or several layers of wet newspaper will be put on top of bare soil or scalped turf prior to planting. Then a layer of three to four inches of wood chips will be placed on top of the cardboard/newspaper. Wood chip mulch will be added as needed on an annual basis, taking care to keep the mulch well away from the trunk flair of trees and the crown of shrubs and perennials.

Habitat development.  Areas of campus will be developed to provide food, nectar, and nesting sites for beneficial insects and birds. Native plants will be chosen where possible in these sites. A source of water and refugia for cover will be provided. Beneficial insects and birds are an important part of the Conservation Biological Control plan.

Nutrient cycling. The nutrients in fallen leaves will be recycled by mowing leaves where they fall on lawns and then returning them to the landscape beds  A thin layer of wood chips will then be added to hold them in place. Where this is not possible, leaves will be collected for use as a carbon source in the compost operation.

Turf mix.  A sustainable lawn care program will use a custom mix of grasses adapted to thrive in the local climate, typically New Zealand white clover and tall fescue grass, and then top seeded with perennial rye. The nitrogen fixing clover reduces the need for fertilizer, is wear resistant and drought tolerant. This model will be used when renovating a lawn on campus.

Grasscycling. Grass clippings will be left on the lawn to decompose, which adds organic matter to the soil and increases water holding capacity.

The McGoldrick Learning Commons rain garden:
Grates in the hard surface direct water into the rain garden. The lower rain garden is about 2,100 sq ft and has a volume of about 20,000 gallons of freeboard (not including the capacity of the soil). A 10,000 gallon cistern fills, filters, and holds water from the Commons addition roof before releasing it into the lower rain garden.
The rain gardens can handle approximately 1.7” of water over the entire site in a 24 hour period of time without overflowing any water into the city storm drains.  This is approximately 100,000 gallons of water managed on site for any given storm event.  The system was designed to handle a 25 year storm event.
The “water wall” feature uses 100% rain water. The cistern behind the wall is about 2,500 gallons with a cartridge filter and an ultraviolet light for water purification. The granite face used for the water wall is repurposed from the old lobby of the Lemieux Library building.
The original building discharges water into two rain gardens on either side of the west entrance.
The west side rain gardens are lined because of historic issues with water intrusion into the library basement. This is a closed system, running from south to north into a HDP-lined swale with a 3ft deep soil/gravel mix.
Total volume of the all rain gardens and swales (west side swales, north side swale, cistern, and lower rain gardens) is about 25,000 gallons. 
The library addition roof is approximately 11,000 sq ft, the original library roof is about 18,000sq ft, so the annual run-off for these two structures is approximately 678,600 gallons.
A little over two million gallons of water falls on the site in an average year. 
The project site was a little more than two acres. 

Lee Miley Rain Garden:
The rain garden between the Lynn building and the Chapel was completed in November 2007 as a solution to winter rains flooding the basements of Lynn, Hunthausen, Xavier and the Chapel buildings. A rain garden is an excavated depression planted to look like a garden. Stormwater infiltrates through layers of soil and gravel as plants transpire moisture and help filter pollutants. Surface area equaling 17,740 sq. ft drains into this rain garden. The rain garden is ten feet deep, lined with a special fabric and perforated drainage system, and filled with a bio-retention mix designed to absorb and retain as much water as possible. Two trenches along the Lynn building west wall route water away from the building. One trench fills the rain garden and the other trench diverts the water from the building's foundation to the City's combined sewer overflow system.  As the garden reaches capacity, excess water flows into the City's combined sewer overflow system.",Snow and ice melt is applied ahead of an event whenever possible to help minimize the amount of product applied. Product is chosen for minimal impact to the environment but also for maximum effect on melting snow and ice for campus safety. ,"In 1989, the Seattle University grounds were designated a Wildlife Sanctuary by the Washington State Fish and Wildlife Dept.

	Good indoor air quality contributes to a favorable work environment for building occupants and visitors providing a sense of comfort, health, and well-being.  These elements combine to seek optimum performance in a comfortable working environment. Cleaning for health is more than changing products – it is a holistic approach to cleaning that encompasses cleaning products, paper products, equipment, processes, procedures, and training of staff, purchasing vendors and work loading.

	Spelman College and its staff, vendors, and operators as stewards of the environment, will promote the practice of green housekeeping to prevent or reduce pollutants generated during the cleaning of the building interior, which in turn will provide a healthier environment.  This stewardship includes establishing an Environmental Stewardship Committee; using integrated pest management for the interior and exterior or the building; purchasing cleaning products that meet the Green Seal Standard GS-37; adopting cleaning practices and procedures that minimize pollutants within the building; establishing a communication strategy for housekeeping/maintenance problems when they arise; adopting construction IAQ standards for future retro-fit, renovation or modifications that may occur on site; and developing an on-going use of a training module to educate housekeeping/maintenance staff on appropriate products, usage, handling and tools for their health and safety, the health and safety of the building occupants and visitors, and preservation of the environment.


Integrated Pest Management Policy

Structural and landscape pests can pose significant problems to people, property, and the environment.  Pesticides can also pose risks to people, property, and the environment. It is therefore the policy of Spelman College Facilities Management & Services to incorporate Integrated Pest Management (IPM) procedures for control of structural and landscape pests. 

Pests

Pests are populations of living organisms (animals, plants or microorganisms) that interfere with use of the facility for human purposes. Strategies for managing pest populations will be influenced by the pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people, property, or the environment.

Pest Management

Approved pest management plans should be developed for the site and should include any proposed pest management measures.  Pest will be managed to:
•	Reduce any potential human health hazard or to protect against a significant threat to public safety.
•	Prevent loss of or damage to structures or property.
•	Prevent pests from spreading into the community, or to plant and animal populations beyond the site.
•	Enhance the quality of life for occupants, staff, visitors and others.

Integrated Pest Management Procedures

IPM procedures will determine when to control pests and whether to use mechanical, physical, chemical, cultural, or biological means.  IPM practitioners depend on current, comprehensive information on the pest and its environment and the best available pest control methods. Applying IPM principles prevent unacceptable levels of pest activity and damage by the most economical means and with the least possible hazard to people, property, and the environment.

The choice of using a pesticide will be based on a review of all other available options and a determination that these options are not acceptable or are not feasible.  Cost or staffing considerations alone will not be adequate justification for use of chemical control agents, and selected non-chemical pest management methods will be implemented whenever possible to provide the desired control.  It is the policy of this facility to utilize IPM principles to manage pest populations adequately.  The full range of alternative, including no action, will be considered.

When it is determined that a pesticide must be used in order to meet important management goals, the least hazardous material will be chosen.  The application of pesticides is subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (7United States Code 136 et seq.), company policies and procedures, Environmental Protection Agency regulations in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, and state and local regulations.

Education

Occupants, staff, visitors and pest managers will be educated about potential pest problems and the IPM policies and procedures to be used to achieve the desired pest management objectives.

Record Keeping

Records of pesticide use shall be maintained on site to meet any state or local requirements. In addition, pest surveillance data sheets that record the number of pests or other indications of pest populations are to be maintained by the Environmental Stewardship Team to verify the need for treatments.

Notification

The facility manager takes the responsibility to notify the occupants, staff and visitors of upcoming pesticide treatments. 

Pesticide Storage and Purchase

Pesticide purchases will be limited to the amount authorized for use. Pesticides will be stored and disposed of in accordance with EPA registered label directions and state and local regulations. Pesticides must be stored in appropriate, secure sites not accessible to unauthorized personnel.

Pesticide Applicators

Pesticide Applicators must be educated and trained in the principles and practices of IPM and the use of pesticides and possess the appropriate licensing required by the state or local regulations.

By taking an IPM approach, the Grounds department attempts to use the most environmentally sound methods for controlling pests that negatively impact the health of plant life on campus.  Every attempt is made to find the most innovative and least toxic way of controlling pests, using chemicals only as a last resort. 

Goals of the IPM Program at Stanford include:
-- Reduce pesticide use and associated exposure risks
-- Reduce the cost of pest control on campus
-- Minimize harm to the environment
-- Improve long-term plant protection
-- Train and educate staff members about the Grounds IPM program

Monitoring for pests and beneficial insects on Stanford plants is one of the main approaches used by the Grounds department as part of our Integrated Pest Management program.

","Principles now heralded as sustainable in the 21st century were fundamental to the Stanford campus since its inception over 100 years ago. Basic concepts introduced by Frederick Law Olmsted, landscape architect and the university's planner in the 1890’s, as well as Stanford’s Landscape Design Guidelines first published in 1989, encourage climate responsive designs, native plant materials and water conservation.

From large gathering space to intimate retreats, developed outdoor areas create a mosaic of formal and informal elements including cultivated gardens, plazas, usable lawns, tree lined alleys, drought tolerant native landscapes, oak groves, wildflowers and grasslands. The result is a dynamic and flexible environment that is essential to Stanford’s rich and unique landscape character.

It is Stanford’s goal today to continue on the path that its predecessors envisioned and use new technologies and understanding to expand Stanford’s sustainable landscape and grounds practices. Examples of current accomplishments and activities in key landscape and grounds areas include the following:

VEGETATION MANAGEMENT
-- Approximately 75% of the campus is native or drought resistant plantings with mulch or non-irrigated grass grounds and native oaks for canopy.
-- To date, over 800 mature trees have been transplanted with an 85% +/- survival rate.
Since 1980, Stanford’s Oak Reforestation Program works with non-profits, volunteers, community and school groups to annually plant oak seedlings, now totaling over 2000.
-- Green waste from tree and shrub trimmings is converted into compost or wood chips and reused on the campus landscape.
-- Seasonal color relies on the choice of perennials and wildflower seedings over more water intensive, non-native ornamental annual plantings.

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT
-- Stanford employs an integrated pest management system to minimize the use of chemicals, synthetics, fossil fuels and water.

IRRIGATION
-- Stanford’s irrigation responds to site conditions using data collected from an on-site weather station with an automated Maxicom Irrigation Controller that conserves 20% more water than conventional irrigation methods.
-- Non-domestic water sourced from Stanford’s Searsville and Felt Lakes is used to irrigate at least 80% of the campus landscape.

LANDSCAPE DESIGN
-- Swales and detention areas planted with native vegetation are integrated into new project landscape designs.
-- Water is incorporated in landscapes for maximum use, enjoyment, air quality and moderation of climate where the largest numbers of people gather and is minimized in peripheral areas, borders or other non-intensive people spaces.
-- Stanford’s landscaped ‘outdoor rooms’ serve as meeting, classroom, break-out, circulation and gathering spaces replacing what would otherwise be constructed, enclosed and conditioned interior spaces.
-- Since 2007, Stanford paired 125+ new or retrofitted custom designed (split to hold bottles, paper and compost) outdoor recycling containers with existing trash bins.
-- Trees are consciously placed to provide shading and cooling for buildings and pavement with an emphasis on deciduous trees along the southern and western building exposures.
-- Turf lawn is typically limited to use areas only.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
-- Campus Planners continue to research the manufacturing processes and material sources of new sustainable products and test their durability and performance over time. -- Current tests include exterior LED lights, recycled plastic furniture and posts, permeable pavements, newly developed drought resistant usable lawn and other plant materials.
-- Responding to concerns caused by global climate change, the university is working with a non- profit to plant a range of oak test species and varieties collected from acorns to explore their adaptability to warming climate, pathogens and seasonal moisture.","About 60% of Stanford's 8,180 acres has been preserved as undeveloped oak woodland (the ~4908 acres noted in the prior section).  Some undeveloped areas include Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, the campus arboretum, and small oak groves across campus.  

Native plants are prioritized in landscaping for maintained areas across campus, and Stanford places special care upon preserving native trees that need to be relocated during the course of construction projects.  Extensive Facility Design Guidelines (http://lbre.stanford.edu/sem/sites/all/lbre-shared/files/docs_public/Landscaping_Design_Guidelines.pdf) and Landscape Design Guidelines (http://lbre.stanford.edu/architect/sites/all/lbre-shared/files/docs_public/UA-CPD_Landscape%20Design%20Guidelines_V1p1.pdf) address the native planting and invasive species. 

A Waterwise Demonstration Garden was also created on campus to educate the community about native plantings and alternatives to traditional residential landscaping (http://bgm.stanford.edu/groups/grounds/special/waterwise).","Grounds keeping waste, including grass trimmings, is actively composted at Stanford. General yard waste is collected from the Grounds Department and the on-campus Faculty/Staff housing and taken to an off-campus facility from which the university is allowed to backhaul a certain percentage for use on campus. Brush collected by the Grounds Department is ground into mulch and used throughout the campus. Stanford also practices ""grasscycling"" by leaving cut grass on the 140 acres of campus turf areas.

Since the inception of the California drought in 2015, Stanford has redoubled its efforts to reduce irrigation, especially in areas that rely on potable water for irrigation, such as the residential Faculty Staff Housing area. However, efforts have also been made to reduce non-potable water used for irrigation, with particular focus on areas like Athletic fields, the Stanford golf course, and irrigation improvements in Residential & Dining Enterprises.

Historically, practices have been limited to snow mold prevention, pythium remediation, and grub remediation at the threshold of 8 or more grubs per square foot.
2)      Monitor and identify pests Ongoing seasonally through soil  profile samples and surface observation.
3)      Prevention Focus is primarily to ensure the health of turfgrass and ornamentals through soil samples and observation of seasonal growth. Grow cloths are used to get a head-start on seasonal turfgrass cultivation and to improve vigor. Applications are limited to snow mold and anti fungals on NY Jets practice fields, baseball, softball and soccer fields. Arboreal applications being made for Emerald Ash Borer on a limited basis.

","We have a full-time student position who is conducting monitoring of invasive species and developing a management plan, which will be enacted by All College Work Days as well as the Work position every year thereafter. Invasive species control and potential spread is considered by the Lands and Energy committee on campus. The College faculty is involved in outreach to the local community, educating them on invasive species on their land.","Cut landscape materials goes into compost (grass & leaves), we don't do anything with brush except let it rot out in piles. ","At Sterling College we work to increase the soil quality of our land with a focus on increasing the health of the biological system found in the soil that nurtures the plants that we grow. We monitor many soil quality factors yearly such as earthworm count, aggregate stability, water infiltration, nutrient and organic matter content etc. We work on feeding a diverse biological system using cover crops, biochar, compost, compost tea and other organic amendments and apply conservation tillage management practices when ever possible. 
","For landscaping and grounds management, we use local and sustainable materials as our grounds are part of our living laboratory. We reuse whenever possible. We manage our farmlands with both tractor and draft horses. ","Stormwater is an issue for the broader community and Sterling College’s land base plays a significant role in the town management of runoff from rain events and snow melt.  The Sterling College overall mission reflects our commitment to land and water quality through sustainable and innovative land use practices.

Ninety percent of our 480 acre main campus and 100% of our 307 acres of off campus property is open space and includes forest, grassland, and wetlands which serve to capture much of the community’s stormwater runoff. The college’s total impervious surface (parking areas, walkways, roofs) is only 1.8 acres of our 480 acres, but we are very conscientious of our stormwater runoff. As we continue to grow as well as renovate our buildings and infrastructure, we are intentional about locating new construction to contour with the landscape, using Low Impact Development (LID) and Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) such as drip line trenches which discharge into natural swales. 

Wetlands play a critical role in stormwater retention and filtration and over 350 acres of the college campus are State and National Designated Wetlands, including the Northern White Cedar Swamp on the main campus and Bear Swamp in Wolcott, Vermont. These wetlands are protected by law and not only provide valuable ecological services, but are important natural areas for conservation and natural history research at the college.

Sterling College is currently working with the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) to develop a Nutrient Management Plan (NMP) for the barns in our Rian Fried Center for Sustainable Agricultural and Food Systems. This plan will help us capture runoff and ensure there is no nutrient loading into nearby waterways. (The NMP will be developed in the summer of 2015.)

Several of Sterling College buildings stormwater runoff feeds into existing drains which flow through a main culvert into a small ditch managed by the town. This ditch travels 100 yards to a larger ditch alongside our significant wetland complex. Stormwater is naturally filtered through this area and then slowly migrates down slope for half mile towards the Black River. A recent survey of the Black River resulted in no significant impact from this practice. 

The Sterling College Lands and Energy Committee is revamping the Sterling College Land Use Plan during the 2015 spring semester and there will be a more specific stormwater management plan associated with the overarching plan. This will be an opportunity for the college community, including faculty, staff, and students, to reevaluate our current LID practices and plan for the implementation of the latest GSI techniques available to our region and landscape. 
","Oddly enough, in northern Vermont, this is quite the issue. We use no salt. We use minimal sand; we truck out snow to a remote parking lot and let it melt. ","On campus is a Vermont class two wetland (mapped on the National Inventory Wetland Map) -- the Cedar Swamp -- which is protected by state wetland law.

Before any planting decisions are made we consider the other elements that contribute to both a sustainable and durable solution.  Areas of consideration include: sun exposure (duration & time of day), proximity to heat and light reflective surfaces,  soil conditions including: taxonomy, physiological, chemical; grade, precipitation and/ or supplemental irrigation issues, desired use, financial considerations, etc.

Those decisions affect the form and function of plant selection.   Where prudent and warranted, the use of native / native adapted plants are promoted.

Generally speaking it is hydrophobic.  That condition is intensified during periods of infrequent or insufficient precipitation or supplemental irrigation.  Furthermore, the average P.H. on campus is a range of  8.6 - 9.4.This condition drastically reduces the availability of naturally occurring nutrients. Lastly, the prominent source of water for landscape irrigation is moderately - highly brackish. Excessive soluble salts applied to the soil exasperate both of the prior conditions.

Our primary mode of operation includes:
Consistent, periodic applications of soil gypsum in combination with soil aeration. to neutralize the salt, loosen the soil, and reduce compaction.
continual topdressing of turf areas with compost & sand blend in conjunction with hollow core aeration.
Occasionally, upon the recommendation of  the annual soil analysis an application of elemental soil sulphur is made.
In highly problematic areas we inoculate the soil with humates and micrrhizae.

Our fertility plan is comprised of organic and partially organic slow release fertilizers.  The added fertilization is confined to high profile, high use areas.","As was stated previously, SSC Grounds Management actively recycles green waste for use on campus and attempts to utilize native/native adapted/water resourceful plant materials. Furthermore, wherever possible all materials are sourced from reputable, local and regional vendors.","The Texas A&M University Campus has a rich history of cutting edge landscape irrigation technology and management.

Grounds and custodial personnel monitor conditions for various pests, and report issues to management. The situation is evaluated, and a decision is made by management if action is required, and at what level. Safety and health issues are central to those decisions, as are risk of infrastructure damage.

An example is that grounds personnel will periodically check random plots and perform a grub-worm count. If a specific threshold is exceeded, appropriate pesticides will be applied. If not, no application is made at that time.
In the case of wasps, they are removed immediately if they pose a sting risk to students, staff, faculty or visitors.

In regard to mosquitoes, a proactive-preventative program is practiced. Any body of standing water or continual dampness is treated with VectoBac in addition to maintenance actions taken to eliminate or minimize standing water and dampness whenever possible.

Regarding bees, action is only taken if the bees pose a safety hazard or have established a hive in an inappropriate place, such as a swarm in a high traffic area. The area is roped off, and the contractor removes the bees during low-traffic hours.

Weeds are treated on an as-needed basis, rather than a periodic basis.

The IPM plan follows a four tiered approach of:
1) Setting thresholds to identify the point at which action must be taken; 
2) Monitoring and identifying pests to select the most appropriate control decision and the least noxious method necessary;
3) Prevention to actively manage the problem to prevent pests from becoming a problem (e.g.: active cleaning of catch basins to decrease the risk of West Nile Virus and also working in conjunction with the MOE to activate a plan if necessary); and finally 
4) Control if deemed necessary by weighting the effectiveness and risk of the method chosen with the method carrying less risk and most effectiveness chosen first. 

UBC Municipal Landscape Services has followed the lead of the City of Vancouver, and has attempted to suspend the use of all chemical pesticides for ""cosmetic"" use. This means that no herbicides, insecticides of fungicides are currently used by our landscape maintenance group on the majority of campus landscapes unless there are extenuating circumstances (i.e. public health issue (e.g. West Nile Virus), invasive plants that threaten native woodland or agriculture, or when the preservation of rare, or heritage landscape elements is critical). Herbicides are used to a limited degree inside the perimeter of two electrical power sub-stations, and a small operations plant nursery. UBC Rose Garden receives applications of fungicide on a semi-regular basis. Unfortunately, the current collection of rose species preserved in this garden would not endure without a regular, preventative treatment of fungicide. 

UBC’s Integrated Pest Management Procedures are posted online at: http://riskmanagement.ubc.ca/sites/riskmanagement.ubc.ca/files/Integrated-Pest-Management-2015.pdf. More information is available online at: http://riskmanagement.ubc.ca/environment/integrated-pest-management.
","With chemical pest and weed control now restricted on campus, UBC Municipal Landscape Services is exploring alternative measures such as a non-toxic vinegar-based herbicides and mechanical controls such as propane torches, alternative planting approaches, organic mulches, and an increased emphasis on manual weed removal.

A UBC SEEDS study was conducted in both laboratory and field testing settings to test the effectiveness of organic herbicides on the most common campus weeds morning glory, horsetail and Canadian thistle. This collaborative project has revealed synergistic properties between organic herbicides, specific weed species susceptibilities and the application methodologies and will continue to reveal where further improvements with regard to product type and application can be utilized. More information about the study is available online at: http://planning.ubc.ca/news-events/newsletter/2013-07-29/battling-weeds.

Those that still exist are located in the UBC Botanical Gardens are protected. The stormwater drainage for the campus is handled using an Integrated Stormwater Management approach that is mindful that the water that leaves the campus eventually is transmitted to the ocean through creeks owned by others, that are adjacent to the campus. Using LEED requirements and applying municipal best practices that include infiltration and detention techniques, extreme events (in terms of rate, quantity and quality) are moderated with cisterns and berming within defined areas to control release of stormwater to minimize erosion within the creeks and minimize damage to the riparian habitats. The Integrated Stormwater Management Plan for the campus also proposes the construction of large, sustainable stormwater management facilities that will handle outlying events and further protect the creeks from the 1 in 100 year events. The remaining natural creeks on the campus are located within the UBC Botanical Gardens are protected from development.","During periods that require snow and ice removal, the main arteries on campus are pre-salted and/ or cleared first to allow for access to the campus. Generally, the intent is to be proactive and use liquid brine in advance of snow or ice conditions, and thus reduce ice build-up and the need for excessive use of rock-salt. Our response is prioritized on the basis of safety and volume of snow and ice, and assessed daily. Weather updates are checked continuously to determine the risk and necessity to salt and assign crews to clearing operations. General landscaping vehicles are fitted with snow ploughs and salters to ensure no extra specialized vehicles are needed on campus that may increase GHG emissions. UBC uses a combination of brine, rocksalt and various deicers, which are soluble, environmentally safe, odorless, non-corrosive and fast reacting. Some deicing products have a dye to indicate the areas that have been salted to reduce duplication and unnecessary re-salting. UBC Municipal Operations is trying a new traction agent this year to supplement our other deicing materials. This product is made of volcanic mineral and is claimed to be safe and beneficial for the environment.","As per UBC's Land Use Plan (amended and approved by the Ministry on August 27 2012), and under the Regional Context Statement section ‘Protecting the Green Zone’, it is specified that the Land Use Plan:

·         Utilization of a tiered approach to pest management on campus. The first tier of pest management is habitat control. This is accomplished by ensuring buildings are well maintained, with regular cleaning and routine clearing of vegetation around buildings to stop nesting of pests. Native and adaptive plantings are utilized to keep maintenance and chemical sprays for pests to a minimum. Also, UC Davis utilizes caution on selecting chemical controls. Chemicals are used as a last resort when dealing with pests. If possible, traps, catch and release, cleaning and other non-chemical methods are utilized.","The horticultural staff of the UC Davis Arboretum have identified 100 tough, reliable plants that have been tested in the Arboretum, are easy to grow, don’t need a lot of water, have few problems with pests or diseases, and have outstanding qualities in the garden. Many of them are California native plants and support native birds and insects. These Arboretum All-Star plants can be successfully planted and grown throughout California.
 
UC Davis landscape staff is in the process of both identifying and converting turf and higher-maintenance landscapes into native grass meadows and drought tolerant regionally-appropriate landscapes on campus. By identifying the most used public spaces on Campus, coupled with the landscape type, staff were able to identify dozens of acres of high water use turf areas that were not needed. These areas will be replaced with native grass meadows that will not require irrigation, and will reduce frequency of maintenance. An initial project removed two acres of irrigated turf and replaced it with native grasses, including the California state grass, purple needlegrass.","Daily grounds operations use mulching mowers and chip landscape waste to recycle as mulch. About 11,520 cubic yards of green waste per year stays on campus and is used to mulch beds for water conservation and weed control.  Green waste that cannot be chipped by campus equipment because it is too small or too big is sent to the local county green waste site. The average is about 3,840 yards per year.  In addition, aesthetically pleasing prunings are used by Catering Services to create floral and decorative arrangements used in campus event catering, as part of the Campus Grown program, which was documented in a UC Davis STARS 1.2 Innovation Credit.
","Campus groundskeepers extensively mulch the campus landscape, which builds soil organic matter through mulch decomposition, and greatly minimizes weed growth. The application of synthetic pesticide is restricted to sports turf, and a specific application for elm trees. A common herbicide (Roundup) is applied for spot weed control/removal.

The Arbor Day Foundation has named the University of California, Davis a ""Tree Campus USA"" for six years in honor of its commitment to effective community forestry management. UC Davis achieved the designation by meeting the required five core standards for sustainable campus forestry: a tree advisory committee, a campus tree-care plan, dedicated annual expenditures for its campus tree program, an Arbor Day observance and the sponsorship of student service-learning projects. UC Davis was one of the first ten campuses to participate in the Tree Campus USA program, and has been re-designated as a “Tree Campus USA” each year since the inauguration of the program in 2008.

"University of California, Irvine",2016-03-23,2016-03-23 10:31:14,khaq@uci.edu,2.0,Pursuing,**,1475.0,192.0,816.0,**,--,56.0,359.0,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/446/6/500/3772/UCI%20IPM%20Plan6_5_12.pdf,"UC Irvine's pest control program is centered on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) system that employs physical, mechanical, cultural, biological, and educational methods to limit pest problems.  Where a chemical pesticide is required as a last resort to control pests, the least toxic chemical pesticide is used.  Basic pest management principles allow the campus community to prevent pest problems and find the best pest control solutions. The basic principles include storing food appropriately, keeping work areas clean and uncluttered, removing recycling and trash regularly, and checking insect entry points to make sure they are properly sealed.

The goals of the IPM program at UCI are:
1. Protect human health and the surrounding environment by employing a range of preventative strategies and using least-toxic products for pest control and eradication.
2. Inspect and monitor pest populations and locations to enhance control strategies.
3. Minimize the quantity and toxicity of chemicals used for pest management.
4. Minimize environmental impacts by using species-specific pesticides and targeting application areas carefully.
5. Establish clear criteria for acceptable circumstances in which using a pesticide other than a least-toxic pesticide is necessary; toxic pesticides shall only be used when there is a threat to public health and safety, or to prevent economic or environmental damage, and only after other alternatives have been implemented and are shown to be ineffective.
6. Provide building occupants and visitors with advanced notice of IPM activities involving use of a pesticide other than a least-toxic pesticide.
","The Green and Gold Plan established four planning and management goals with supporting objectives:

Goal 1. Develop a landscape that is sustainable and provides for long-term conservation of resources: energy, water, labor, and reduced production of green waste.

    Water Conservation—Utilize plant materials, design and planting techniques, and irrigation systems that minimize water usage.
    Plant Suitability—Use native and other environmentally suitable plant materials.
    Species and Age Diversity—Ensure both diversity of species and diversity of age in the urban forest. Trees of the same size and age tend to decline and die during the same period causing costly planning and maintenance problems and necessitating long periods of re-growth.
    De-Intensification of Eucalyptus Trees—Remove existing eucalyptus trees due to hazards or decline and replace with native and drought tolerant species which will introduce age diversity in the central campus.

 
Goal 2. Develop campus landscaping and open space networks that maximize local and regional natural resource values.

    Habitat Value—Utilize native plant materials that provide high wildlife foraging value.
    Habitat and Open Space Linkages—Develop habitat corridors utilizing UCI's historic drainage ways, or arroyos, that connect the campus with regional open space areas such as the San Joaquin Hills and the wetland areas of the Upper Newport Bay, San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh, and San Diego Creek. Protect existing habitat resources. Restore, as networks of corridors and habitat sites, the isolated patches and discontinuous landscape corridors that were created under the original LRDP development. This will benefit the campus and also support regional habitat planning goals.
    Preservation—Preserve natural features and environmentally significant areas. Retain the character of campus topography, ridge lines, view sheds, and vistas. Preserve historic landscape.

Goal 3. Develop landscaping that provides the greatest functional value consistent with comprehensive campus planning and design objectives.

    Maximize Functionality—Multiple functions, beyond aesthetic considerations, must be provided: define spaces, provide solar shading, define circulation elements, provide visual screening, reduce scale of monumental campus buildings, create public open spaces, and provide recreational amenities.
    Design Consistency—Implement campus landscape that is consistent with, and supports, campus planning and design objectives to provide a unifying framework, place identity, and human scale to the campus.
    Institutional Quality—Utilize plant materials, hardscape, and street furniture of institutional quality (i.e., long-lived, pest resistant, and durable).

Goal 4. While selection of appropriate plant materials and proper planting and irrigation techniques are crucial first steps in developing sustainable landscaping, it is equally important that adequate management programs are in place to preserve this asset.

    Pruning—Prune to remove hazards and to improve vigor and aesthetics.
    Fertilization—Environmentally responsible nutrient management to maintain plant health and reduce susceptibility to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses.
    Inspection—Scheduled inspections for overall health, safety, and appearance.
    Removal and Replacement—Even with good tree management, all trees will ultimately decline and require replacement. When removals are required, they are evaluated within these criteria: 1) dead or dying trees; 2) trees that pose a hazard to people or may cause significant damage to buildings, property, or hardscape; and 3) trees growing in undesirable locations.
    Protection—Control disease and pests through an integrated and environmentally responsible pest management program. Protect from physical hazards.
    Green Waste—To minimize waste and meet solid waste regulatory requirements, all trimmings should be processed into mulch and used to control weeds, control erosion, retain soil moisture, and provide nutrients.
    Habitat Areas—While habitat areas will generally require far less ongoing maintenance than more urban landscape areas, special management is required for protection of habitat value and for teaching and research activities in these areas.

As a living laboratory, UC Irvine views sustainable landscape management as an engagement opportunity for the campus and community.  In this regard UC Irvine was awarded with the National Arbor Day Foundation's highest national award for volunteer engagement as a result of UCI's collaborative Shadetree Nursery program which pursues urban forestry and habitat enhancement engagement through locally grown native trees and shrubs that are planted through student and community volunteers on sites throughout campus and the local community.","The Green and Gold Plan identifies native and climate appropriate plants for use on campus and management of the campus open space networks to maximize habitat and natural resource value.  UCI sustainability staff, faculty, and students work collaboratively on campuswide habitat protection and enhancement programs involving the creation or restoration of native plant associations to provide native habitat in campus upland, wetland, and riparian habitat types. 

Current projects have included the replacement of a turf area adjacent to the administration building and a new bikeway that have both been landscaped with California native plants. Future projects are looking at reducing underutilized turf areas and replacing with California native plants through student volunteer planting events.  

Facilities Management controls invasive species including artichoke thistle, pampas grass, tamarisk, and other invasive species that threaten habitat resources.  UCI grounds staff follows the IPM plan to manage invasive species.",UC Irvine composts 100% of its landscape waste. The campus uses two methods of mulching: It uses self-mulching mowers on grass and annually chips 150-plus tons of green waste for compost used in planting beds and park trails on campus. ,"The following is from the UC Irvine Implementation Procedures for Erosion Control and Landscape Management plan, adopted in May 2012:

UCI employs shredded or chipped plant materials with an appropriately high wood content as a mulch cover over the soil in planting beds and other exposed soil areas in the landscape. Mulch insulates plant roots, reduce weeds, minimize water loss, and control erosion, dust, and mud problems. Decomposition of mulch improves the condition of the soil and adds nutrients to the plants. Wherever feasible, UCI selects native and drought tolerant plant materials that do not require excessive use of fertilizers as the first step in controlling fertilizer use. When fertilizer is applied the following procedures are implemented.
• UCI grounds staff is trained to apply fertilization using the correct application rates and timing for each targeted plant species to avoid excessive plant growth, diminish the potential for runoff and water quality impacts, and promote healthy, disease, and pest resistant plants.
• UCI grounds staff are trained to use slow-release and organic-based formulas based on plant nutrient needs. This will reduce excessive growth that increases the need for pruning and mowing. UCI uses organic based fertilizers that are incorporated into the soil within planting beds to avoid runoff. A list of approved fertilizer types are listed below. MSDS sheets are made available upon request (see Responsible Party at the conclusion of this section).","Because UC Irvine uses reclaimed water (which contains higher levels of nutrients than potable water) for irrigation and has a robust mulching program with compost produced onsite through greenwaste recycling, fertilizer is rarely used on grounds. If fertilizer is used, it is organic. The campus also benefits from having an on-site nursery that provides a majority of trees that are locally grown along with some native shrubs and grasses. ","The Long Range Development Plan identifies preservation and enhancement of the natural arroyos (season drainage features). As part of the natural hydrology of the campus these arroyos serve important functions as riparian habitat for native species, rainwater management, and recreational corridors to the campus community. 

UC Irvine's Water Action Plan includes provides for Low Impact Design (LID) as required strategy for all new construction and major redevelopment projects. The campus already has a variety of sustainable stormwater treatment facilities including bioswales, sand filter beds, percolation galleries, and natural treatment facilities that help protect the integrity of its watershed. The Office of Environmental Planning & Sustainability is working with research programs on campus to develop demonstration projects incorporating vegetated swales to treat runoff associated with on-going operations.
",Not applicable in this climate,"UC Irvine manages two protected habitat reserves at the Irvine Campus and two additional protected habitat reserves off-campus.

The 135-acre Ecological Reserve at the Irvine Campus is a part of the regional 37,000 Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP) habitat reserve. The UCI reserve land is protected, managed, and monitored for habitat and wildlife conservation by UC Irvine in partnership with other NCCP public and private landowners in the community and state and federal resource agencies to enhance regional habitat value.  UC Irvine was the first University to participate in the successful planning, formation, and collaborative management of an NCCP reserve.

The 202-acre San Joaquin Marsh Reserve at the Irvine campus is protected and managed by UCI to support a variety of wetland habitat types. Along the Pacific Flyway, the marsh is a stopping place for more than 100 migratory bird species. The marsh also serves as an educational and research location for the University.

The Steele/Burnand Anza Borrego Desert Research Center is a 78-site protected and managed as habitat near the Anza Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County. Located within the Sonoran Desert, the site contains a variety of plant and animal species native to the region.

The 306-acre Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, managed by UC Irvine, is located in the western Mojave Desert near Joshua Tree National Park. Habitats within the reserve include pinon-juniper woodland, Joshua tree woodland, montane chaparral, desert wash, and freshwater seep. ",True,http://www.ceplanning.uci.edu/greengold.html,UC Irvine was recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation for the 2014 Partnership Award for its management of UCI's urban forest.  This award recognized UCI's collaboration with the Irvine Ranch Water District and other community partners to manage a volunteer-based on-campus nursery which provides locally grown native and drought tolerant shade trees which are planted primarily by student and community volunteers on campus and in the local community to support UCI sustainable landscape goals.

Pests seek habitats that satisfy basic needs such as food, water and shelter. A successful program depends on the client and campus pest control staff working together to establish an environment that limits harborage areas, points of entry and conditions that attract pests.

IPM is based upon regular inspections, accurate identification of pests and of the specific area actually infested.
IPM prevents pest problems by eliminating pest habitat, and access to food, water and other essential needs.
IPM requires that you decide when the pest has become intolerable; zero tolerance may not be necessary for every pest.
IPM responds to pest problems with mechanical, physical and biological controls, and resorts to chemical controls last.
IPM requires an evaluation of the toxicity and exposure potential associated with any pesticide to assure that the alternative used has the lowest toxicity and lowest risk for unwanted exposure.

UC San Diego uses and is consistent with the following definition of integrated pest management (IPM): a pest management strategy that focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of pest problems through a combination of techniques such as encouraging biological control, the use of resistant varieties, and the adoption of alternate cultural practices (such as modification of irrigation or pruning to make the habitat less conducive to pest development). Pesticides are used only when careful monitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established guidelines, treatment thresholds, or to prevent pests from significantly interfering with the purposes for which plants are being grown. 
 
UC San Diego promotes the following Best Management Practices for IPM: If pesticides are to be used, the campus uses the least toxic and most effective products and uses organic based products whenever possible. UC San Diego is dedicated to pursuing the reduction and elimination of the use of pesticides by utilizing the signal word ""Warning and Danger."" The campus is and will continue to be on the forefront of sustainable landscape management.

Also, Landscape Services employs the use of mulch for weed prevention and moisture retention thereby reducing the need to irrigate more often. Landscape technicians are also directed to pull weeds whenever possible to reduce the use of chemicals.","The institution’s approach to sustainable landscape is to encourage environmentally sensitive building exterior and hardscape management practices that provide a clean, well-maintained and safe building exterior while supporting high-performance building operations.  Best management practices are applied that reduce harmful chemical use, energy and water waste, air pollution, solid waste, and chemical runoff.","UC San Diego’s campus master plan and other approved planning document define the use of native plantings. Excerpts: “Indigenous vegetation should be considered as a landscape fabric that has a coastal sage and chaparral integrity and heritage to it.” “The use of grass as a ground cover is discouraged except in sunny locations where students, faculty…may gather on a lawn. Planting areas, to the greatest extent possible, should be covered by a variety of xeric-tolerant, indigenous, and ornamental shrubbery and ground cover.” 

The landscape management staff values the use of native plants; When reviewing plans for a new landscape, inclusion of appropriate native plantings are verified. For example recommending the use of Salvia clevelandii for a shrub in housing project instead of using Pittosporum crassifolium. UC San Diego landscape management employees are the unofficial watch dogs for the protection of existing native habitat adjacent to a new development. Plant material identification questions during employment hiring include common native plantings.

The IPM Advisory Committee works to proactively minimize the use of pesticides and promote the application of IPM methods. Since its origin, the IPM Advisory Committee has banned the use of pesticides inside UCSB buildings, mandated that IPM methods be used on all University properties, and replaced pesticides with environmentally friendly products. A detailed account of the IPM Advisory Committee's accomplishments can be accessed at the link below. ","Groundskeepers at UCSB continuously participate in sustainable landscape management. All of the vehicles/ carts used by the staff are either electric or compressed natural gas, products applied to the landscape are fertilizer- and herbicide-free, 90% of the Main Campus is irrigated with recycled water, grass trimmings are mulched on-site, large woody debris is mulched by the waste hauler and often returned to campus, and the staff regularly conducts audits to ensure the irrigation systems are operating at maximum efficiency. In addition, many of the groundskeepers have and are able to participate in the Green Gardener Certified Program, hosted by the Continuing Education Division at Santa Barbara Community College. This program offers education, training, certification, and promotion of landscaping practices that improve resource efficiency and reduce pollution on landscape sites. Chemical pesticides are considered a last resort under the tenets of integrated pest management. IPM promotes the use of a range of preventative and non-chemical approaches to control pest populations and stave off infestation. ","Landscape guidelines at UCSB prioritize that the perimeter of the University is landscaped with native vegetation. Native plant species are also used in landscaping around buildings and other structures. The University does place an emphasis on creating landscapes that encourage large gatherings, and although these particular areas may not always consist of native vegetation, architects are encouraged to utilize drought tolerant plants and native plants in surrounding fringe areas and where appropriate. In addition, for teaching and restoration purposes, more than 233 acres are protected and being restored to native plant communities. 
","At UCSB, all grounds keeping waste is collected for mulching purposes. For lawns, trimmings are directly deposited back onto the grass, a system called Grass Cycling. The trimmings of all other vegetation, such as plants and trees, are stored in a campus depository to be later used as mulch. Approximately 300-400 cubic yards per year of this mulch are used for soil and landscaping purposes. ","Groundskeepers in both departments of Facilities Management and Housing & Residential Services primarily utilize pesticide- and herbicide-free products. In 2013, over 28 tons of spent coffee grounds from the University were applied directly to the landscape and planters as a soil amendment and weed barrier. In addition, UCSB regularly utilizes the compost produced by the compost facility where UCSB sends their organic material to be processed. ","At UCSB, a large majority of the University's groundskeepers' vehicles are either electric or compressed natural gas (CNG). The use of gas powered equipment is limited to only a couple hours each day to minimize environmental and noise pollution. In addition, the groundskeepers regularly undergo training from Environmental Health & Safety staff, much of which includes instructions and best management practices on using their equipment and tweaking their practices in an environmentally friendly manner. If an infestation with unacceptable impacts occurs, thereby warranting additional treatment, the IPM then favors the use of least-toxic 3 UCSB Facilities Management Integrated Pest Management Plan pesticides. The targeted application of a toxic pesticide is allowed only after all other reasonable non-toxic options are exhausted","UCSB irrigates 90% of the main campus with recycled water. Impervious surfaces are often bordered by bioswales in order to decrease runoff and promote infiltration and groundwater recharge. Examples of large impervious surfaces bordered by swales include parking lots and the library corridor. The Davidson Library corridor at UCSB is also paved with permeable pavers that allow water to infiltrate them and not run off. This feature significantly decreases stormwater runoff. It is of the utmost importance for UCSB's Environmental Health & Safety department and the Cheadle Center for Biological and Ecological Restoration to ensure and restore the integrity of the natural hydrology on campus, which is often done through testing and audits, working with groundskeepers and contractors and implementing restoration programs/ projects.  ","The University of California Santa Barbara is in a temperate coastal climate that does not experience drastic seasonal variation. Weather patterns of the region do not support snow or ice accumulation.
","The UCSB campus is bordered by five surface water bodies: Devereaux Slough, Goleta Slough, Campus Lagoon, the Pacific Ocean, and Storke Wetlands, all of which are protected from urbanization. The 2010 Long Range Development Plan classified 237 acres of campus land as environmentally sensitive habitat area (ESHA), including UCSB's Coal Oil Point Reserve, because of the area's rarity, special role in the ecosystem, and/or because the area served as a natural buffer to more sensitive areas.

The CASFS/UCSC Farm Center supports research on the basic ecology of agricultural systems with the goal of designing farming methods that conserve resources, maintain yields, and protect the health of surrounding natural landscapes. This agroecosystem approach, based on ecological principles such as nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and predator-prey relationships, is critical to developing an agriculture that can be maintained into the future. 

Researchers working with the Center also experiment with growing practices to improve yields, optimize nutrient use, decrease off-farm impacts, and reduce or eliminate reliance on synthetic chemical inputs. Much of this work takes place directly with growers on their farms and on the Center’s 30-acre organic farm at UCSC.

Areas of interest include:
Control of strawberry pests and diseases with anaerobic soild disinfestation (ASD) and trap crops.
Crop rotations to suppress pests and diseases and improve fertility.
Pest and natural enemy population dynamics.
Variety trials for organic specialty crop production on the Central Coast.
Cover cropping with annuals and perennials.
Analysis of nutrient uptake in organic and conventional systems.
Farmscaping with native hedgerows and vegetative buffer strips.

The University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) campus manages snow and ice removal through a campus Snow Committee.  The committee consists of members of all the departments responsible for snow and ice abatement from campus sidewalks, building entries, streets, parking lots, and parking structures.  The three main entities responsible for the physical removal of snow and ice on the UCB campus are:    1. Facilities Management; 2. Housing and Dining Services; and 3. Parking and Transit Services.  The Snow Committee meets monthly during the season and at least twice in the off season.
Various approaches are in place for removing snow and ice as effectively as possible.  This includes hand shoveling, traditional plowing, snow brushes, and the use of several chemical products.  The use of snow and ice abatement products includes liquid Magnesium Chloride, granular salt/Calcium Chloride mixes, and on a limited basis, a sand/salt mix.  
The number one environmental concern related to program is air quality.  Additional concerns include plant damage and water quality.  For all these reason, the campus uses various chemical products designed to be as effective as possible while reducing any environmental impacts.  One way this is achieved is by using different products based on current conditions of a particular snow event.  Temperature is the most important factor.  If temperatures are not too low, campus is able to use products with lower concentrations of active ingredient.  
The continued use of a sand/salt mix, although limited, is primarily a cost consideration as some alternative ice melt product can cost up to 2.5 times as much.  
Regardless of which product is used, the committee continues to look at ways to reduce the amount of material applied.  Obviously, the majority of the use is dictated by weather conditions.  The winter of 09/10 was the 2nd worst/best snow in 50 years.  Weather like this makes it challenging to set a numeric target for reduction.  
One of the biggest impacts we can have on product usage is through the annual Winter Injury Prevention Program.  As part of this program, a detailed snow and ice removal training is given to all our (custodial) staff responsible for snow and ice abatement from building entries and ADA access points.  The training focuses on safety and proper use of ice abatement chemicals.

Other Current Efforts
•	Exploring additional / alternative chemical products such as sugar beet-based products
•	Continuing to refine and better define departmental responsibilities through the use of GIS mapping systems.

In the past, every raindrop that hit UofL's rooftops (over 2.2 million square feet on Belknap campus alone!) and pavements was channeled into the same sewer system that handles our sewage which truly needs to be treated. But, as our former Vice-President for Business Affairs, Larry Owsley put it, ""When you have that much rain in that short a time, the sewers — which are large sewers — just back up and there's no place for the water to go."" Even if the sewers can handle stormwater from UofL, the treatment plants at the end of the pipe often cannot, leading to dangerous releases of untreated sewage into the Ohio River - a threat to human health and ecological integrity.

UofL has pursued means of lessening the risk of flood and reducing our campus' contribution to the problem by diverting stormwater from the sewer system all together through infiltration and rainwater harvesting projects, or by slowing its release through water absorbing changes to our campus landscape. Around campus, we have disconnected downspouts, installed vegetated green roofs, and built rain gardens and bioswales to facilitate groundwater recharge through infiltration.
In recent years, UofL made several changes to campus landscaping, parking lots and rooftops, with the help of $1.25 million in cost-sharing from MSD. We think that this significant investment will essentially pay for itself by helping prevent millions of dollars in future flood damage. We are also hoping the projects at UofL will serve as an example for similar projects across the city on both public and private property.

•Inventory of the University's woody and herbaceous plants and identification of pest problems.
•Monitoring of areas and organisms that have been pest problems in the past.
•Remediation using management tactics in the context of the particular pest and plant host.
Inventory
Our inventory is a database catalog of all the campus landscape trees. Every landscape tree is tagged with a unique identification number. This database identifies specific trees by their species, size, and other inventoried data. There are approximately 15,000 landscape trees.

Monitoring
We use the tree inventory together with our knowledge of the University landscape to monitor for insect and disease occurrences and environmental stresses (e.g., leaf and bark scorch, girdling roots, nutrient deficiencies, etc.) before these occurrences become problems.

In cases where the insect or disease occurrence is a problem, we use monitoring as a technique to measure population size and to determine if and when we need to use remediation measures. An example of this technique is using insect pheromone traps to monitor the elm bark beetle population.

We observe and collect weather related data to estimate when certain insects will hatch their eggs and anticipate the outbreak of certain fungal diseases. An example of weather data monitoring occurs in the management of elm leaf beetles using degree-day monitoring. A degree day is a unit based on accumulated heat to measure physiological time.

Remediation
Before applying pest management control measures we determine what action is needed and whether that action is likely to be effective. The majority of our landscape pest problems are minor or do not threaten plant health and therefore no action is taken. When action is needed, we use more than one method in combination to provide more effective control. As a part of our Integrated Pest Management Plan we use cultural, mechanical, physical, biological, and chemical control measures.

We base our pest management program on cultural control. Cultural controls begin with selecting healthy specimen of pest resistant species, properly planting them, and maintaining their vigor with the necessary irrigation and fertilization. Providing plants with the proper care is our foremost consideration and the best line of defense against pests. In addition to proper installation and establishment, we give a lot of time and effort to pruning appropriately to minimize pest problems.

We are attempting to use physical controls, e.g., barriers to prevent plant pests from doing repeated damage. Examples of this kind of control are bands around particular trees to discourage gypsy moth invasion or barriers around the trunks of young trees to prevent damage from dogs and squirrels.

Our biological control attempts have been limited to successful use of Bacillus thuriengensis for the management of eastern tent caterpillar. We are exploring the use of predaceous insects, but have not worked with any species yet.

Annually, we will utilize chemical means for controlling landscape pests such as weeds, insects, and diseases. The use of chemicals on campus is a last resort tactic. We will use the least toxic chemicals available and have had great success using horticultural soaps and oil. All the staff who apply pesticides are certified by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and we heed all of the occupational and environmental precautions and suggestions in addition to ecological common sense.

These are practices we follow:

• Define action thresholds that allow environmental conditions to dictate when pest control action must be taken to maintain plant health
• Define which insects and weeds require action, and which do not pose a threat to plant health and therefore require no action
• Aerate to reduce plant stress
• Monitor moisture to ensure plant health, making them less susceptible to pest problems
• Include plants that attract beneficial insects to help naturally control destructive insects
• Remove weeds by hand to reduce chemical use, when practical
• When chemical treatment is necessary, only apply directly to affected areas and use  only the minimal amount to effectively address problems and vary use to prevent resistance.","We use information supplied here to guide our approach:

http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/landscaping/

There are five considerations in designing a sustainable landscape. The landscape should be:

Visually Pleasing
Cost Effective
Functional
Maintainable
Environmentally Sound

These considerations are not new nor have they been without considerable discussion. Problems arise, however when some considerations are forgotten or unrecognized until after the design process is complete and implementation has started.

Sustainability in the design process is also affected by the order of the main considerations. Having a visually pleasing landscape is usually the most important consideration and is addressed first in the design process. This is easy to understand since it is the primary concern for most clients. A close second, or of equal importance to a client, is cost.

Many times functionality, maintenance and the environment receive less attention or are neglected altogether until a problem arises in the completed landscape.

With a sustainable approach to landscape design, the visually pleasing and cost effectiveness considerations should be the last ones evaluated.

This in no way diminishes the importance of a ""good looking"" or cost effective landscape, but challenges the designer to create that beauty from a more sustainable approach.

A more sustainable order of considerations would be:

Functional
Maintainable
Environmentally Sound
Cost Effective
Visually Pleasing

It is important to note that none of these considerations are mutually exclusive in the design process. The development of any design will require that each piece be revisited several times in light of the others before the best solution is reached.","Our campus has four different 'eras' that our grounds crew must consider when planting.

UNH Facilities personnel are responsible for exterior pest monitoring and control on the UNH campus grounds. Crews have worked over the years to try to avoid pesticide use. The following protocols are in place in the University’s IPM Program and are used by Facilities staff to determine the appropriate action when an insect pest is detected.   

Insecticides: The University of New Hampshire’s IPM practices include no regular spraying of insecticides on trees and shrubs for pests. When a major pest outbreak does occur and spraying is warranted, the most environmentally friendly method is used that will still give good success of control.  For the 20 years between 1979 and 1999, damage from insect pests was low enough so as not to exceed threshold levels of insect damage, therefore requiring little insecticidal spraying. However, in 1999, a new turf pest moved into the area making it necessary to increase monitoring efforts and targeted spraying with species-specific insecticides.  These efforts allowed Grounds and Roads crews to choose the least-toxic effective material for control and time the applications to minimize the amount of material required. This also releases fewer chemicals into the ground, the water supply, and the air.  It has also greatly reduced the chemical exposure to the Grounds and Roads crews who are in charge of treating these problem areas, as well as anyone who uses the University grounds.  Also, until 2000, any insecticide that was used on campus grounds was biological.  Biological insecticides are based on living entomopathogenic (infecting insects) organisms, usually bacteria, fungi or viruses, or which contain entomopathogenic products from such organisms.  They are often the least toxic species-specific option for controlling insect pests. 

Herbicides: If an herbicide is deemed necessary, spot treatments instead of area-wide applications are performed, thereby killing only the targeted plant.  When possible, herbicides are applied while weeds are small to reduce the amount of material used and to prevent seed production.  

Fungicides: To date, UNH Facilities personnel do not apply fungicides on campus grounds.   
 
On-campus Partnership: In 1999, the European chafer, a turf pest relatively new to New England arrived on the grounds of UNH.  The immature (grub) stage of this beetle is very destructive to turf.  Grubs feed mainly on the roots of grasses often killing the plant.  UNH Cooperative Extension Specialist Stanley Swier and UNH Facilities Gardener Robert Bennett worked together on an IPM Program specifically to control the European chafer. The monitoring aspect of the program involves constantly updating maps of UNH grounds where European chafer grub damage has occurred.  Maps from past and present years are then compared to determine where treatment may be necessary.  Unfortunately, because the European chafer is highly destructive in turf, an insecticide is the only effective control measure.  Facilitiespersonnel use the least-toxic effective material available to treat for the insect. The use of the detailed maps showing turf damage enables a timely application of this less toxic pesticide, preventing use of a more toxic material that would be required for control later in the insect’s life cycle.  
 
On the Cutting Edge: UNH Cooperative Extension Specialist Stanley Swier has also conducted research with DuPont for the past 5 years working on a new low-risk insecticide that will be available for use soon. The insecticide, called Acelepryn, contains a new active ingredient and mode of action that will offer turf professionals consistent performance and low application rates, along with an excellent toxicological and environmental profile.  Acelepryn has been classified as a reduced risk insecticide by the EPA, which dictates that there is extremely low mammalian, honeybee, fish, and bird toxicity.  Through Stanley Swier’s work with DuPont, UNH may well be one of the first universities to use Acelepryn to reduce European chafer grubs on campus grounds as part of our IPM program.","http://www.unh.edu/cmp/pdf/unh_2012_approved_campus_master_plan.pdf

The Landscape Design Guidelines establish a framework to guide the subtle enhancement of the campus landscape not transform it. The guidelines build upon, not radically alter, the campus’ rich design heritage by emphasizing simplicity, balance and ecological sensitivity. The Landscape Design Guidelines are principle based, founded on the tenets of sustainability and the belief that landscapes should be managed not simply maintained. They are flexible and allow for contemporary expression. Long-term management considerations must be weighted equally with issues of aesthetics and sustainability.These guidelines are divided into 4 parts: Landscape Preservation, Landscape Restoration and Landscape Enhancement. The Landscape Design Guidelines also include the University’s standards for Site Furnishings.","The Sustainability Institute through the UNH Ecosystem Task Force collaborates with academic classes, faculty, UNH Facilities and the Office of Woodlands and Natural Areas to promote and maintain sustainable landscaping throughout campus for the education and enjoyment of the community, the enhancement of natural systems, and the protection of biodiversity. All groups worked closely with sustainable landscaping experts to develop a 101-page UNH Sustainable Landscaping Master Plan (SLMP) that became part of the umbrella UNH Campus Master Plan in 2004. The SLMP includes a detailed list of suggested native trees, shrubs, and vines in addition to identifying less desirable, highly invasive species. Also, UNH Cooperative Extension also provides information to the broader UNH community about the benefits of landscaping with native plant species.

Preserving the vitality of the campus’ trees is paramount to preserving the character and integrity of the campus landscape. It is the goal of every construction project to protect as many trees as possible during construction so that the landscape looks as mature and cohesive as possible. It is therefore important that tree preservation be considered early
in the planning and design process. Trees that are landmarks, significant in form or serve a vital aesthetic role shall be given special consideration in the evaluation process.","All grass trimmings, prunings, and landscaping waste is brought to Kingman Farm on the UNH campus for composting. In the fall, all of the fallen leaves are collected by UNH Facilities and brought to Kingman Farm. In the spring, UNH Facilities uses compost from Kingman Farm for all of the Durham campus flowerbeds.",UNH's farms are on certified organic land: http://www.colsa.unh.edu/aes/facilities,"The Landscape Master Plan lays out suggested materials to consider using in landscape and groups management, including:

- Granite pedestals should gradually replace the existing granite benches in the core of the campus. Granite pedestals should be cut from native stone and supplied by local sources.

- Environmentally harvested teak from the island of Java offers a responsible alternative to teak not sourced using eco-harvesting practices. Stringent government regulations control the production of the island’s teak. Trees are harvested in 30-40 year cycles and adhere to strict environmental policies that ensure the long term renewal of this resource and a stable economy for citizens.

- Asphalt unit pavers are a unique paving alternative to concrete or brick pavers. Asphalt (Hanover) pavers are extremely durable, resistant to salts and mineral oils, do not absorb moisture, offer excellent slip resistance, do not deflect or dent, come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors, can be removed and replaced, absorbs heat in the winter (which helps melt the snow), are tolerant of heavy vehicle loads (do not settle), are very tolerant of the snow plow and other maintenance equipment, are comfortable to walk on, and are aesthetically acceptable. Asphalt pavers should be considered for primary walkways throughout campus.

- Concrete unit pavers are an attractive paving alternative to asphalt or cast-in-place concrete sidewalks. Concrete pavers have been used on campus and have proven to
be durable, resistant to salts, offer excellent slip resistance, and can be removed and replaced, and if installed properly are tolerant of heavy vehicle loads and snow plows. Concrete unit pavers should be considered for secondary walkways throughout
campus.","The 2004 Landscape Management Plan says the following: ""To prevent the further degradation of wetlands, a comprehensive Watershed Protection Plan should be further
developed beyond those that have been delineated in numerous portions of the campus. It is important that the entire watershed be considered when developing the plan’s goals and objectives. Manage campus wetlands to control non-point source pollution and control runoff to lessen downstream flooding. Respect shoreline protection setbacks:
do not site structures within 50’ of a shoreline reference line. Do not apply any fertilizer within 25’ of a shoreline reference line. Where existing, a natural woodland buffer should be maintained within 150’ of a shoreline reference line unless activity is related to that shoreline. Identify locations of point source pollution and develop appropriate mitigation plans. Wherever feasible, develop landscape plans that daylight buried streams and restore/enhance natural corridors linking fragmented ecosystems.","UNH snow and ice removal strictly adheres to the broader UNH Stormwater Management Plan. All salt-spreading trucks are calibrated to ensure proper distribution of salt. Streets are swept twice a year to collect sand put down during winter storm events. The volume of sand collected is reported within the Stormwater Management Plan, and sand budgets take into account the volume used in the previous year. There are approximately 550 catch basins on campus, which collect stormwater and snow melt, and are part of the cleaning and repair program. An outside company cleans the catch basins, and this is overseen by UNH Utilities.","All of UNH woodlands (3500 acres) are a Tree Farm that is nationally recognized as third part certification of sustainability.

In order to achieve their mission, the Woodlands and Natural Areas Committee has established three management goals: to provide, protect, and produce.

To Provide
Areas are to be provided which afford opportunities for research, education, and recreation while also allowing for management activities to occur. Furthermore, it is important for the University to provide an example to the public of well managed Woodlands and Natural Areas that implement strategy of shared resource management. 

To Protect
As with the Hippocratic oath, first do no harm. Such is the view of the Woodlands and Natural Areas Committee regarding the areas under their care.&nbsp;As a University entrusted and dedicated to providing well-rounded educated citizens with a sense of balance for the future, it is necessary that we promote areas that will provide a healthy environment for future generations. 

To Produce
The Woodlands and Natural Areas Committee recognizes the needs for natural resources. As part of the educational and research opportunities that&nbsp;are supported; it is necessary to view many of the areas under their care as commodities that must be managed in order to ensure their continued supply. Therefore, it is imperative that the office strives to produce many resource elements in marketable quantities. 

Guiding Management Principles
Recognizing their duty of stewardship and to set an example to others of properly managed woodlands and natural areas, the Office of Woodlands and Natural Areas achieves management objectives, while observing the following tenets: 

Support ecosystem integrity
Support biological diversity
Support sustainable forest utilization
Protect the productivity of the resources in their care
Provide educational, research, and recreational opportunities

Objectives

The Woodlands and Natural Areas Committee has established the Office of Woodlands and Natural Areas to help fulfill its mission, meet its management goals, and operate under its guiding management principles. More specifically, the office will implement the following objectives to assist it in accomplishing the Woodlands and Natural Areas Committee's mission and management goals: 

Provide a variety of stand vigor conditions
Provide a variety of vegetation types
Provide a variety of stand age classes
Maintain an adequate forest road access and maintenance program
Maintain a centralized research, recreational, and forest management record keeping system.
Improve and maintain a variety of wildlife habitat 
Enhance compatible recreational opportunities
Prevent watershed degradation
Provide educational opportunities and assistance to students

The acreage actively managed by Grounds is about 565 acres, which excludes building footprints and forested areas. The University Forest Manager and a two-person IPM staff work with Grounds crews that are assigned to 16 campus zones. There are over 50 crew members licensed in pesticide application by the NC Pesticide Board and trained to implement the IPM plan.
1.	Action Thresholds – Action thresholds are set according to plant and site-specific conditions with the goal of maintaining plant health and campus appearance with minimum hazard to people and environment.
2.	Monitor and Identify Pests – Zone crews search for signs of potential threats and take effective measures before the level of pests reaches an action threshold requiring the use of a pesticide. Zone crews search for eggs that can be treated safely before pests arise. Certain insects can be hand-picked off plants, e.g. bag worms. When a pest threat that meets an action threshold is identified, a work request is sent to the IPM staff.
3.	Prevention – To the extent possible, the Grounds Department plants species that are resistant to common pests. Plant diseases are controlled by scheduling fertilization and irrigation to prevent spores from germinating, reducing the need for fungicides.
4.	Control – The IPM staff uses the least hazardous treatment first. Eggs are treated with low-impact dormant-oil sprays. As a last resort, specific products targeted to specific plants are used. The only broad-spectrum product used, Round-up, is narrowly applied; it is hand-sprayed on walkways only. Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is not done.
","UNC practices sustainable landscape management by:
1. Preserving historic landscapes 
2. Protecting the tree canopy
3. Aerating the soil and tree roots as needed
4. A soil erosion and sediment control plan
5. Planting the right plant in the right place relative to site use and conditions and stormwater management goals
6. Mulching and composting landscape trimmings
7. Integrated Pest Management","The Grounds Department installs native plants whenever possible. In addition, native and non-invasive plants are incorporated in landscape design guidelines for the University campus, the Carolina North project, and the North Carolina Botanical Garden.

UNC Campus – In 2005, the Task Force on Landscape Heritage and Plant Diversity developed Guidelines for Landscape Designers Working on the UNC Chapel Hill Campus, which states a preference for choosing native plants and plants adapted to the ecological conditions of sites under development or renovation. According to the Guidelines, plantings should be appropriate to the North Carolina piedmont, preserve the tree canopy and forested areas, include plants that provide food and shelter for wildlife, and avoid invasive plants. Recommendations for landscape design incorporating these preferences are given for each campus district (Section X. Recommendations for Landscape Designers When Working in Each District). The appendix section provides lists of plants that are Southeastern US natives or exotics with proven usefulness in Southeastern landscapes (Section XI), and invasive plants to avoid or to use only where their spread will be monitored and controlled (Section XI.F).

Carolina North – The landscape design for the planned 925-acre Carolina North campus will require the use of appropriate native and non-invasive plant species, according to the 2009 Carolina North Development Agreement, Article 5, Sections 21-5.21.1 and 5.21.2.

North Carolina Botanical Garden – The NCBG has a policy of removing and preventing accession of known invasive exotic species from its collections. In most areas of the Garden, only plant species native to the Southeast US are cultivated. In some areas where exotic species are traditionally contained, native plants are selected for new plantings whenever possible.","The recycling program is staffed by two grounds employees who use state-of-the-art equipment, including a tub grinder, to process waste materials accumulated from pruning and trimming trees and shrubs. All landscape waste is returned to campus as compost or mulch. Grass clippings, turf, and leaves are converted into leaf-compost, and hardwood scraps are converted to mulch.

","Grounds practices soil aeration, as needed, to promote plant growth and mulching to retain soil moisture.",Grounds reduces its environmental impact by converting equipment from two-stroke to four-stroke engines. The new equipment is quieter and produces significantly less air pollution. All landscape waste generated on campus is mulched or composted. ,"The University's Environment, Health, and Safety Department developed a soil erosion and sediment control plan. The plan must be incorporated into all construction documents before a project can be sent out for bid. Components of the plan include the following provisions:
1. Identifying areas with a high susceptibility to erosion,
2. Limiting disturbance on steep slopes, 
3. restricting clearance to only those areas necessary for construction, 
4. covering any cleared areas that will be unworked for seven days, 
5. planting cleared areas that will not be worked for 30 days.
Contractors must designate an on-site crew member who is responsible for soil erosion and sediment control, including the maintenance of sediment basins and other control strategies.","Snow and ice removal is accomplished by spraying a thin layer of a brine solution where needed. The brine application uses far less salt than the conventional surface application of granular salt, greatly reducing the associated environmental impacts.

The UNCG Grounds Dept. landscapes with plants that are generally known to be disease and insect resistant. Some insect and disease damage can be tolerated if the plants can be kept healthy and vigorous enough so the pests do not seriously harm the plants.
2. UNCG monitors the landscapes to identify any pest problems in order to prevent them from becoming excessive.
3. UNCG begins to take action with less risky pest control options when infestations become large. When the viability of a plant is threatened is targeted spraying of pesticides employed. Should this not work, only then will broadcast spraying be employed. Where pests have become intolerable in the past, systemic insecticides and preventative measures proper cultural practices have been employed.
4. UNCG prefers to rely on natural predators and the above mentioned methods and will take action before damage becomes extensive.","The UNCG Grounds Department strives to create a landscape which is both attractive and thrives off the local environment, with minimal inputs from personnel. By using the “right plant in the right place,” the landscape essentially can take care of itself.  Native plants fight off diseases and pests without the use of harsh chemicals or other non-sustainable practices; they also require less water than traditional landscapes and survive with natural rainfall rather than supplemental irrigation.  When using supplemental irrigation, it is conducted at times of day that minimize water loss due to evaporation. Further, UNCG utilizes drip irrigation technology, which gets water to the plant roots most effectively. UNCG is also currently in the beginning phase of using a smart irrigation system that incorporates evapotranspiration rates to accurately and efficiently irrigate turf areas.
UNCG also utilizes mulching and bio-retention strategies. There are bio-swales and other bio-retention areas on campus, which naturally filter runoff from buildings through plant roots and the soils. The use of natural mulches in the landscape helps with water loss due to evaporation, reduces competition from weeds, and minimizes erosion.  The mulch decomposes over time to benefit the plants by providing the nutrients they need to sustain themselves.
","UNCG has a comprehensive tree maintenance program, focusing on proper pruning techniques and removal of any damaged/diseased areas. Trees are the foundation of our campus landscape, not only for beauty but for soil stabilization, water-uptake, and the release of oxygen. During any construction or renovation our Campus Tree Care Plan is strictly followed by employees and contractors. This ensures trees are protected to the best of our ability; should any have to be removed, the Plan ensures that replacement trees will be planted back in the area.","The Grounds Sports Turf Maintenance Team composts all grass clippings. Grass clippings are left after mowing the warm season sports fields. All rotary mowers are equipped with mowing blades which pulverize and leave grass clippings behind during the mowing operation, cycling the nutrients back into the soil. During aerification of the sports fields, the resultant plugs are composted and used as top-dressing over the fields. Clippings from the golf greens are added into the pile of aerification plugs and mixed for a top-dressing as well.

During leaf-drop in the fall the same mowers mulch as much leaf litter as possible on turf areas. If the level of leaf drop is so heavy that it may impact over-seeding, the leaves are vacuumed up. Some of the leaf litter is transported to both Piney Lake (a UNCG-owned recreational site approximately 8 miles from the main campus), and the City of Greensboro Arboretum,  where it is composted. In 2013-14, approximately 12 tons of leaves were diverted to these two locations from the landfill.","UNCG Grounds utilizes soil stabilization practices in every aspect of its day-to-day operations. One strategy employed to preserve soils is to keep something growing on them in all seasons.  The soils are managed in large part by the organisms that thrive on them. 
Although UNCG Grounds considers Nature to be the best manager, when intervention is necessary they use procedures such as erosion blankets and sodding to help keep soils intact when an area is disturbed. Plant beds are amended with natural materials such as cow manure and composted soil from other natural products.  This provides the soil with additional beneficial organisms, decreasing the need for synthetic fertilizers.
All of our newer facilities use some kind of ‘Best Management Practice (BMP) for storm water run-off.  Through bioretention and natural swales, we filter the runoff through plant and/or turf roots before it enters the city wastewater system or our creeks and streams. These methods help to manage our soils by reducing erosion and providing green space which would otherwise be an impervious surface. Finally, native plants help to increase organic matter in the soil by boosting microbial activity and soil aeration.
","UNCG Grounds uses biodegradable mulches, including pine bark and hardwood.  These mulches break down over time and are naturally incorporated into the soil. Plant beds are amended with natural materials such as cow manure and composted soil from other natural products. This provides the soil with added beneficial organisms, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.
Fertilizers that are used on campus contain micronutrients which are vital to plant and soil health. Many fertilizers contain only macronutrients, which plants need in larger quantities; micronutrients are no less important but are needed in smaller amounts. These added beneficial nutrients help plants to naturally fight off environmental stresses such as drought, temperature extremes and insect/disease pressure. 

Grounds works extensively to assist the campus community garden. The Garden Club acquired used lumber from an abandoned barn to create its raised beds, and Grounds works with its tree contractors to supply mulch made from downed limbs and trees. This mulch is used to line pathways in the garden.
","Naturally vegetated buffers are maintained on the banks of campus streams to prevent erosion and filter runoff before it enters the water body; some areas have been enhanced through live staking. UNCG Grounds also utilizes the paths of campus storm water to create dry stream beds consisting of river stones.  The stones allow the water to flow to its path of least resistance without soil erosion.  
Finally, Grounds is working with Facilities Management and the Sustainability Office to install a rain harvesting system that will reduce campus water consumption for annual plantings.  The system will capture and store rainfall for irrigation of annuals. Rainwater is better for the landscape than municipal water because of the natural organisms in rain. This system will also reduce stormwater runoff. 
","The Grounds Department uses an ice melt product that contains magnesium chloride. This product is less environmentally problematic than other chloride-based products such as calcium chloride and sodium chloride. Any runoff from this product contributes less chloride contamination in surface waters because it has one-third less chloride content versus other chloride-based options. Further, since magnesium is a common ingredient in most fertilizers it will not harm vegetation. Finally, this product is less harsh on concrete areas such as sidewalks and driveways; concrete where the product is applied shows less scaling and chipping, thus reducing maintenance costs and the affiliated environmental costs.","Peabody Park is a 34 acre area at the north end of the UNCG campus. The Park contains forest, grassy areas, and streams, providing habitat for many flora and fauna that characterize the Carolina Piedmont. The Park’s woods provide a glimpse of the native oak-hickory beech-maple forest that once covered this region of the United States. Branches of Buffalo Creek that flow through the Park are part of the headwaters of North Carolina’s Cape Fear river system (http://www.uncg.edu/reg/Catalog/0910/UnivComm/peabody.html).

The importance of championing the remaining natural habitat on campus, i.e., Peabody Park, is noted in the university's Master Plan Update. This plan channels all future development to the south of the existing campus.

In practice, the university has worked to improve the health of Peabody Park over the last several years. Native trees (loblolly pines, oaks and dogwoods) have been planted to reforest an area of Peabody Park, and periodic workdays to remove English ivy, bamboo and other invasive species occur twice per year. One result of these efforts is that Greensboro Beautiful Inc. awarded its '2010 School Award' to the Peabody Park Preservation Committee for the work to preserve Peabody Park woods.",True,http://facsustainability.uncg.edu/grounds/,"Information for this credit was received from Kevin Siler, Grounds Department at UNCG and Rhonda Strader, GIS specialist for UNCG."

At the University we have chosen to implement an IPM program of pest control. This will give us opportunity to insure the control methods are most environmental conscious in our applications. Commons sense approach to control, monitor and manage a wide range of pests is our goal.
The guidelines for our program will establish thresholds for the community, environment and property in and surrounding the University. We will understand the lifecycle and their relationships with the environment and use control methods that are not only economically sensible but with a high level of environmental concern as well. We will strive for an organic program throughout but will use pesticides for the safety of the campus and control of certain pest as needed.
We will utilize the four step method by using the following guideline:
Thresholds We then will decide with input from necessary individuals to set correct threshold for the pest. Some pest thresholds will be simple such as fire ants on campus. This would be an example where immediate control is needed due to potential harm they may bring to a person on the campus. While 3-4 aphids on a shrub may not require any treatment.
Scout and Monitor The program will require us to monitor pest on campus and changing level or numbers. Not all pest will require treatments. Proper identification and control options are researched.
Prevention Proper pruning, fertilizing and water management for plant material will give the    plant the best possible way to fight against pest. Our strategy will be to grow the best plant to insure it can withstand pest infestations. 
Control Once all methods are complete and we have a complete understanding of the pest and our options we can make the best control decision. We will always use the least toxic balanced with the best control products when choosing the control method for the pest. If needed we will utilize additional pest control measures to control persistent or returning pest with target control measure. No broadcast or total treatment of pest on campus will be done unless the IPM procedures lead to best case scenario.

The objective of this program is to maintain pest populations below action threshold levels while insuring minimal human exposure to health risks, inflicting minimal hazards on the environment, providing for effective monitoring through inspections and standardized record-keeping, and evaluating the effect of the IPM practices.","The UO main campus in Eugene minimizes fertilizer usage, composts all landscape waste, uses only environmentally friendly ice-melt, mulches and uses mechanical weed control. They do not use any insecticides in the landscape and have an Integrated Pest Management Plan.   

Additionally, landscape maintenance standards are as follow:  “The Exterior Team is creating campus landscape maintenance standards in order to unify and clarify the aims of maintenance staff.  The standards are outcome-based rather than methods-based.  For example the standards will address the desired appearance and structure of pruned shrubs, rather than pruning techniques.
 
The intent is that groundskeepers will have common goals in their maintenance activities, and that this will result in uniform health and appearance of campus landscapes.  These standards will be useful benchmarks for identifying priorities within landscape maintenance zones, and for evaluating progress.
 
These standards will not replace the discretion of individual groundskeepers in special circumstances, such as in response to specific customer requests, safety issues, and unique planting types.  The hope is that these standards will be equally useful to groundskeepers and supervisors by providing a shared reference point when questions arise or needed work is identified.  Possible categories are turf, trees, shrubs, perennials, groundcover, mulch, hardscape and irrigation.”  

Regarding satellite locations:  OIMB has a small staff and a low maintenance landscape.  They do not use pesticides outside of the buildings. They do not pick up lawn clippings, do not use  fertilizers, and simply trim things back and blow things off of the paths.  The land is  zoned for forests so cannot be further developed.  UO Portland has essentially no  land to manage beyond the building footprint.   At the Shire, the management plan is basic.  They mow to keep back blackberries and other invasive species under control and prevent meadows from turning to forest by preventing succession. They have to spray for invasive species including blackberries, English ivy, giant hogweed, but under the direction of a certified pesticide license. The Pine Mountain Observatory operates on a lease from the Deschutes National Forest (like a ski resort). Maintenance focuses on  keeping  the parking lot and pathways free of weeds.  The forest service removes trees that obstruct views from the telescopes.

Eugene, OIMB and the Shire have salmon bearing rivers and streams and the Shire is along the Columbia River, so are regulated by the varying institutions (US Army Corps of Engineers, City of Eugene, Columbia River Go

","The UO Eugene uses native plant species that are adapted to their climate zone whenever possible, while also paying attention to climate change by shifting toward drought-tolerant species in current and future plantings.  The campus is characterized as a 411-acre arboretum-like environment containing approximately 4,000 trees and (according to the Campus Tree Plan http://map.uoregon.edu/campusmaps/treeatlas.pdf), 469 native species of trees.  This plan outlines tree protection and preservation measures that go back historically. A plant-rich environment, there is ample habitat for wildlife, especially birds.  

There are many existing buildings that meet LEED Gold or even Platinum standards, while all new buildings are required to do so. Many projects try to get points for ecologically appropriate plantings. Example:   Lewis Integrative Science Building is the first LEED Platinum Higher Education Laboratory Building in Oregon and earned points for using climate-appropriate landscaping requiring minimal maintenance in addition to preserving two existing Oaks by raising pathways to protect new and existing roots.  

Regarding satellite locations:  OIMB is zoned for forest and all plants are replaced by native plants that are low maintenance including shore pines, ground cover of kinnikinnick, salal, huckleberries and others.  There are some legacy trees on the OIMB campus, including fruit trees.  

The Shire protects and restores meadow and woodland habitat for the cultural and ecological benefits, including the restoration of a salmon oxbow stream in partnership with the Cowlitz Tribe. They have a full time horticulturalist that prevents the spread of invasive species mostly through mowing and limited spraying. 

UO Portland is mostly composed of concrete with some city-managed trees out by the street.  The Pine Mountain Observatory is situated in the Oregon Coast Range in the Deschutes Forest at 6,300 feet and indirectly protects and preserves this leased property in a collaborative way.","The UO Eugene Campus composts 100 percent of its yard waste at Facility Services and then returns the compost to campus when it is ready. It also mills the wood from fallen trees on campus to be used as finished lumber around campus (as highlighted in one of our ""Innovation Credits"" in our 2011 STARS report.) For example, Milled wood has been used in Ford Alumni Center and Allan Hall for paneling, artwork, and cabinetry.  Grass trimmings are not usually collected, and are returned or left on the lawn. During the Fall, Grounds Maintenance uses the collection system to pick up leaves for composting. https://campusops.uoregon.edu/services/landscaping-litter-removal.  

Regarding the satellite locations:  The OIMB buildings are on sand and surrounded by native plants.   Most of the landscaping work involves leaf blowing and mowing where material is left in place or put in brush piles. 

The Shire minimizes its impact as much as possible, letting nature take its course to maintain the historically-altered landscape by mowing and brush cutting and composting waste.  This way of having minimal contact requires their horticulturist to work full time through all of the seasons.","UO Eugene uses compost that is created on campus for mulching and soil amendment and avoids disturbing the native soils. They control erosion by making sure vegetation is healthy and avoid exposed soils.  

Regarding satellite locations:  The OIMB campus is all on sand as a sandy beach as a part of the coastline in the past, and the forest is undisturbed.  New construction is the only time soil is disturbed.  

The Shire preserves the native soils and must be cognizant of US Army Corps of Engineers restrictions on erosion control along the river so tries to maintain native riparian plants.  Both UO Portland and Pine Mountain Observatory do not work with the soil.","UO Eugene uses native plant species that are adapted to our climate zone, whenever possible. Fertilizers are minimized by applying only when needed in particular instances and are limited per the Integrated Pest Management Plan.  Regarding other satellite locations:  OIMB and the Shire are protected locations, so they share a goal of least disturbance and preservation. ","For UO Eugene, all development must meet standards for minimizing impervious surfaces and providing natural infiltration for rainwater (for example we have bioswales, rain gardens, flow through planters, and green roofs). Landscape practices prioritize water retention over drainage in piped systems.  

Strict city ordinances guide most of our practices including two relevant goals related to this credit 

“(1) Reduce runoff pollution from development by reducing impervious surfaces and capturing and treating approximately 80% of the average annual rainfall and 

(2) Except as otherwise allowed by this land use code, allow disturbances or development within drainage ways only when all of the following conditions exist: 

(a) The disturbance or development will not impede or reduce flows within the drainage way; 
(b) The disturbance or development will not increase erosion downstream; 
and (c) The constructed pipe system is sized to convey all of the runoff from the upstream watershed when the upstream watershed is completely developed. “

(Section 9.6790 added by Ordinance No. 20369). 

Regarding the satellite locations:  OIMB has wetlands that run through the campus, which started as an underground ditch that drained the forest.  In1980, it was turned into an open stream that runs into the bay that is now salmon bearing as the ODFW now uses it as an area to release smolt and there is a salmon ladder. Wastewater runoff  goes into county sewer drain. The streams and ditches are left alone. The roofs are drained to the gutter systems that also go out to the harbor.  Only about 5% of campus water (besides the roof) goes into storm drains because of the sand, runs off into the grass and soaks in. The water way is not prone to flooding, even when hit by a big storm.  Only when high winds hit does water temporarily flow in with puddles here and there.  

The Shire is on Columbia River so has US Army Corps of Engineers hydrologic restrictions on the riverfront.  The Cowlitz tribe is involved currently with a water quality study as the geologic formations have shifted and made the water rusty so they are concerned about water quality and permeability.  The goal is to create ideal salmon habitat by reestablishing and restoring the oxbow creek as a salmon habitat.   Because it is on the north side of the Columbia River, the land slopes gradually to the river but floods infrequently.  They do not and cannot change the flood plain.  There is one stream on the property that drains directly into the Columbia River. Water temperatures is 55 degrees, much colder (and therefore better for salmon) than the Columbia, which can be 10-15 degrees warmer in the summer months. ","At UO Eugene, snow and ice events occur infrequently ( 0-5 times per year).  The UO's strategy for ice is to use sand whenever possible and only use environmentally friendly ice-melt as a last resort. Snow removal is done with utility vehicles brushes and blades to clear walks for people to get into buildings.  

Regarding the satellite locations:  OIMB, which very rarely experiences freezing temperatures, puts salt on the steps as needed to keep them from being hazardous.  ","UO Eugene follows progressive city ordinances, which protect and preserve ecologically sensitive areas. “The Eugene City Council has adopted policies that direct the City to pursue sustainability (Resolution #4618), protection of natural resources (Growth Management Policy #17) and recovery of threatened Upper Willamette Spring Chinook Salmon (Resolution #4615) in its activities. Eugene Environmental Policy: https://www.eugene-or.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=1083. 

Regarding the satellite locations: OIMB has an 80 acre coastal forest reserve that is the oldest stand in Coos County.  The deed limits development to research purposes and most of the campus is zoned as forest.  

The Shire occupies a 75-acre waterfront site in the heart of the Columbia River Gorge directly across from Multnomah Falls and is part of the national scenic area. Purchased in 1965, John Yeon wanted to protect it from possible industrial development.  

UO Portland is housed in a LEED Gold Certified refurbished facility that merges parts of three historic buildings—the Bickel Block Building, the Skidmore Block Building, and the White Stag and Hirsch-Weiss Building. The location of the White Stag block is within Portland’s Skidmore/Old Town Historic District, which is a district that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places “for its historical associations with the early development and economic growth of the Pacific Northwest’s most important urban center of the last half of the nineteenth century.” (National Register of Historic Places, 1977).

The program is developed to be proactive versus reactive. The IPM program is a planned program of long-term surveillance and suppression. The program documents the monitoring of the campus grounds and facilities. This data interpretation provides an accurate determination of pest activity on the campus therefore providing opportunities for control and suppression. The program extends beyond treatment processes. The data is used to develop tools to prevent the populations from spreading and developing breeding locations by way of barrier based protection and food and water source reduction.  Data is compiled and made available electronically for review by the University by the Pest Control Operators.,"The University is in the process of developing a 3-year sustainable landcare program.  The program will be consistent with the University's recent achievement of becoming Phipps Sustainable Landscape Accredited.  Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, Pitt's neighbor in Pittsburgh's Oakland community, recently established this accreditation to provide educational resources for landscape and lawn care professionals.  Accredited organizations must attend a three-day accreditation course, pass an exam, pledge to provide sustainable landcare according to the Northeast Organic Farming Association (NOFA) Standards for Organic Land Care, and attend a minimum level of relevant landscaping education every two years.  Over the next 3 years, the University will be incorporating more organic products into its landscaping operations.  An assortment of new products will be evaluated for effectiveness over this period, and the most successful products will be incorporated into our standard maintenance procedures.  A concerted effort has been made in recent years to increase the quantity of perennials, native and drought-tolerant plant, using more native plants that require less watering and maintenance.  Organic products such as compost and mushroom manure are used are used in flower beds to enhance the nutrient value of the soil.  Very little synthetic fertilizer is used on campus, and opportunities such as compost teas are being explored to further reduce the use of these products.  All landscape waste is composted off-site, and mulching lawnmowers are used.  All mulch used on campus is made from recycled materials, and is purchased from the same vendor who takes the University's landscape materials for composting.  Many hillsides have been planted with ground cover to reduce stormwater runoff and mowing requirements, and several large concrete areas have been replaced with green space.  Irrigation is limited, and where necessary, irrigation is provided during optimal times to reduce water usage.  The few irrigation systems on campus are being outfitted with rain sensors that will be activated according to the moisture levels in the soil.  This will not only reduce the amount of water used for irrigation by only irrigating when necessary, but will also help to reduce rain run off resulting from saturated soils.  The University recently purchased 7 new drop spreaders for the application of snow melting materials on sidewalks.  The spreaders do a much better job of applying materials more directly to sidewalks than the older rotary spreaders, thereby reducing the amount of over-cast materials getting into soils and impacting plants and lawns.  During the winter of 2015/16, the University has realized an estimated 50% reduction in the amount of materials required during normal snow and ice events.  ","A concerted effort has been made in recent years to increase the use of native and ecologically appropriate, low maintenance plants.  The University does not purchase any plant materials from the invasive plant list, and designs landscapes for appropriately sized plants that will require limited maintenance. During construction & renovation projects, the University installs fencing around the root zones of trees and shrubs and does not permit construction activities in those areas.  If necessary, trees and shubs are removed and stored, then replaced at the end of the project or installed in alternate locations on campus.  The University is working on a more detailed tree maintenance program to better document and improve campus tree management, and has been working to plant additional trees in many areas.  A study is in progress to evaluate the health and structural condition of all trees in the area surrounding our signature Cathedral of Learning.  This area is the largest green space on campus and contains the largest collection of trees on campus.  This study will form the basis of our Campus tree plan.  A project at an on-campus elementary school enlisted volunteers to clear a large hillside of invasive species and transform the area into nature trails and an outdoor classroom setting.  As noted above, new drop spreaders have significantly reduced the amount of snow melting materials required to clear sidewalks by eliminating overspray, resulting in less impact to surrounding plants and lawns.","All landscape materials removed from campus are picked up by a local contractor for composting.  This contractor also serves as the University's vendor for mulch, compost,  soils, and other materials.  It is very possible that the materials sent by the University for composting come back to campus as soil amendments for campus landscaping.  The University is changing from recycled mulch to shredded bark mulch which is free from contaminated woods and dyes.  Mulching lawnmowers are used, dropping clippings back on the lawns to reduce landscape waste.","The University uses primarily organic composts, mulches, and mushroom manure in campus flower beds, and is evaluating the use of compost tea to eliminate the need for synthetic fertilizers.  Very minimal fertilizer is applied to lawn areas, and mulching mowers reduce the need for fertilizers by returning nutrients to the soil through grass clippings.    ","Plants are purchased from local growers and all mulch, compost, manures, and soils used on campus are purchased from the vendors who take the University's landscape waste for composting.  This spring, the University will be switching to shredded bark mulch which is free from contaminated woods and dyes.  Compost tea is being evaluated to further reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers.  More native and drought tolerant plants have been incorporated into landscape designs in recent years. 
In addition, when purchasing new landscape equipment, alternative fuel equipment (such as electric and propane) is being evaluated to reduce the University's reliance on gasoline-fueled equipment. ","The University has installed green roofs in eight campus locations to reduce stormwater runoff and lessen the impact on the City of Pittsburgh's aging stormwater system.  Bioswales were constructed as part of a new construction project to provide natural drainage to the site.  Several student rain gardens have been constructed in problem areas on campus, and sites are being evaluated for additional installations.  A natural underground aquifer was discovered during construction of a campus building and an access point was built into the project to allow access to the untreated water.  The water is collected into a specially designed truck and is used in summer months for watering flowerbeds and hanging baskets. The small number of irrigation systems on campus are being outfitted with rain sensors designed to operate only when soil conditions dictate.  This will not only reduce the amount of water used for irrigation, but will also reduce run off from saturated soils.

INTRODUCTION
Pests are populations of living organism (animals, plants, or microorganism) that damage property or interfere with the aesthetics or use of University facilities for human purposes.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) establishes a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health and environmental risks.

The University of Richmond has adopted this Integrated Pest Management Plan for the landscape and grounds the University manages. The plan outlines procedures to be followed to protect the health and safety of students, faculty, staff, and visitors from pest and pesticide hazards. The plan is designed to voluntarily comply with policies and regulations promulgated by the Department of Agriculture for public buildings and university facilities.

Objectives of this IPM plan include:
•	Elimination of significant threats caused by pests to the health and safety of students, faculty, staff and the public.
•	Prevention of loss or damage to landscapes or property by pests.
•	Protection of environmental quality inside and outside buildings.

The goal of Integrated Pest Management is often not total elimination of a pest.
That is unrealistic.  The goal is to minimize the problem to an acceptable level. This IPM plan will be stored in the office of the Landscape Department.
IPM COORDINATOR
The Landscape Department Manager or designee shall be the University of Richmond’s IPM Coordinator and be responsible to implement the IPM plan and to
 


coordinate pest management-related communications between the University of Richmond, service providers, faculty, staff and students.

ANNUAL REVIEW
This IPM Plan will be reviewed and revised annually by the IPM Specialist, the Landscape Department Manager and Assistant Manager, with input from the University’s Sustainability Manager and representatives of the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service.

POSTING AND NOTIFICATION OF PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS
When pesticide applications are scheduled at University of Richmond-managed grounds, pesticide applicators shall provide posting and notification in accordance with product label instructions.  All students, faculty, and staff will have access to pesticide application information through the University’s Facilities Department website, http//facilities.richmond.edu/.

Use of a least toxic pesticide or self-contained nonrodent bait does not require notification.  If pesticides other than least toxic pesticides are used, building occupants will be notified not less than 72 hours before the pesticide is applied in a building or on surrounding grounds under normal conditions, and within 24 hours after application of a pesticide in emergency conditions (LEED 2009).

RECORD KEEPING & PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION
The University of Richmond will maintain records of all Service Provider visits and pest control treatments for at least three (3) years. Information regarding pest management activities will be made available to the public at the University of Richmond Landscape Department office.

TRAINING
All pesticide application staff will attend training required to maintain certification with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Periodic information and question/answer sessions may be offered to interested faculty, staff, and students to provide an overview of the University’s Integrated Pest Management activities.

GENERAL IPM STRATEGIES
Pest management strategies may include education, exclusion, sanitation, maintenance, biological and mechanical controls, and pre-approved, site-appropriate pesticides.

An Integrated Pest Management decision at the University of Richmond shall consist of the following steps:

1.	Identify pest species.

2.	Estimate pest populations and compare to established action thresholds.
 



3.	Select the appropriate management tactics based on current on-site information.

4.	Assess effectiveness of pest management.

5.	Keep appropriate records.

Decisions concerning whether or not pesticides should be applied in a given situation will be based on a review of all available options. Efforts will be made to avoid the use of pesticides by adequate pest proofing of facilities, good sanitation practices, selection of pest-resistant plant materials, and appropriate horticultural practices.

When it is determined that a pesticide must be used in order to meet pest management objectives, the least-hazardous material, adequate for the job, will be chosen.

All pesticide storage, transportation, and application will be conducted in accordance with the requirement of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 United States Code136 et seq.), Environmental Protection Agency regulations in 40 CFR, Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, University of Richmond policies and procedures, and local ordinances.

No person shall apply, store, or dispose of any pesticide on University of Richmond-managed property without an appropriate pesticide applicator license. All pesticide applicators will be trained in the principles and practices of IPM and the use of pesticides approved for use by the University. All applicators must comply with this IPM policy and follow appropriate regulations and label precautions when using pesticides in or around University facilities.

Pest-specific strategies will be included in the IPM Program Specifications provided to each service provider.

PEST-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES
The following strategies will be used for frequently encountered pests:

Weeds in Mulch Beds

Threshold:  Any
1.	When possible, pull or dig weeds up manually, being sure to remove root material, before the weeds are mature enough to produce seeds.
2.	Apply pre-emergent weed preventer, such as FREEHANDTM or SNAPSHOTTM granules according to label directions, to all beds February-April and June- July.  This is most effective if applied to bare ground before re-applying mulch, and watered in thoroughly. All granules will be immediately swept or blown off of sidewalks, patios, roads, etc. before the applicator leaves the treatment area.
 


3.	Maintain 2-4 inches of clean mulch cover to inhibit weed growth and retain moisture.
4.	When applying dye such as Mulch Magic to mulched areas, a liquid pre- emergent weed preventer, such as PENNANTTM (S-metolachlor 83.7%, one ounce per gallon of water) may be added to the dye mix, for areas where granular pre-emergent weed preventer has not yet been applied for the season.

Nutsedge or broad-leafed weeds in ornamental grass such as liriope (see #1,2,3 above):
When manual removal is not practicable, spot treat as early as possible with a selective herbicide labeled for nutsedge and broad-leafed weed control, such as BASAGRANTM (Sodium salt of bentazon 44%) mixed
0.75 ounces per gallon of water or equivalent.  Manual removal of nutsedge is seldom effective, due to extensive underground rhizomes.

Grassy weeds in ornamental grass such as liriope (see #1,2,3 above):
When manual removal is not practicable, spot treat as early as possible with a selective grassy weed herbicide such as NUFARM SETHOXYDIMTM(Sethoxydim 13%) mixed 2.9 ounces per gallon of water or equivalent.  Manual removal of bermuda grass is seldom effective, due to extensive underground rhizomes.

NOTE: BASAGRANTM and SETHOXYDIMTM can be mixed together in the same tank to control nutsedge, broad-leafed weeds, and grassy weeds in liriope beds where this is needed.

Broad-leafed or grassy weeds in open mulch areas (see #1,2,3 above):
When manual removal is not practicable, spot treat as early as possible With a non-selective herbicide, such as glyphosate 41% mixed 2.6 ounces per gallon of water or equivalent.

Broad-leafed or grassy weeds in sidewalk cracks, curbs, patios.

Threshold:  Any

When manual removal is not practicable, spot treat as early as possible
with a mixture of both a non-selective weed killer and a pre-emergent weed preventer, such as 2.6 ounces of glyphosate 41% plus 1.0 ounce of PENNANTTM (S-metolachlor 83.7%) per gallon of water.

Poison Ivy near walkways and parking lots

Threshold: Any

When manual removal is not practicable, spot treat as early as possible with an
 


herbicide labeled for poison ivy control, such as glyphosate 41% mixed 2.6 ounces per gallon of water or equivalent.

Weeds in turf areas

General turf areas
Weed thresholds are high in general turf areas. The need for pre- and post-emergent herbicide applications may be made on a case by case basis.

Showcase warm-season turf areas - Bermuda, Zoysia such as the Baseball field, Practice fields, President’s Circle, …
Cultural practices such as spring fertilization in accordance with the Warm Season Nutrient Management Plan for the University of Richmond, and aeration and over-seeding can improve turf health, thereby minimizing opportunities for weeds to establish.

Apply pre-emergent weed preventer such as LESCO RONSTAR .95% PLUS FERTILIZERTM (Oxadiazon 0.95%) at the rate of 50 lbs per 6900 square feet. Granular pre-emergent herbicides should be thoroughly watered-in with at least ½ inch rainfall or irrigation. DO NOT apply pre-emergent weed preventer within 90 days prior to over-seeding.  Consult the product label to insure non- interference with future over-seeding operations.  All granules will be immediately swept or blown off of sidewalks, patios, roads, etc. before the applicator leaves the treatment area.

When broad-leafed weeds appear, spot treat with a broad-leafed weed killer such as COOLPOWERTM (MCPA 56.14%, Triclopyr 5%, Dicamba 3.6%) mixed 0.91 to 1.29 fluid ounces in 0.5 to 5.5 gallons of water to treat 1000 square feet.  The higher rate can be used on dormant turf.  Use the lower rate when warm season turf is actively growing. Consult the product label to insure non- interference with future over-seeding operations.

Showcase cool-season turf areas – Fescue (Front Wall, …)
Cultural practices such as fall fertilization in accordance with the Cool Season Nutrient Management Plan for the University of Richmond, and aeration and over-seeding can improve fescue turf health, thereby minimizing opportunities for weeds to establish.

Apply pre-emergent weed preventer such as a turf fertilizer containing BARRICADETM (Prodiamine) according to the manufacturer’s label directions during February – March and April – May.  Granular pre-emergent herbicides should be thoroughly watered-in with at least ½ inch rainfall or irrigation.  DO NOT apply pre-emergent weed preventer within 90 days prior to over-seeding. Consult the product label to insure non-interference with future over-seeding operations. All granules will be immediately swept or blown off of sidewalks, patios, roads, etc. before the applicator leaves the treatment area.
 



When broad-leafed weeds appear, spot treat with a broad-leafed weed killer such as COOLPOWERTM (MCPA 56.14%, Triclopyr 5%, Dicamba 3.6%) mixed 0.91 to 1.29 fluid ounces in 0.5 to 5.5 gallons of water to treat 1000 square feet.  For fine fescues such as creeping red or Chewing’s, DO NOT apply
until the turf is 3 years old, and use the lower mix rate. Insects, fungus, and other diseases damaging ornamental plants
Prevention is the primary method of pest and disease control, including:

Choosing plant varieties that are hardy and well-suited to the micro- environment where they will be placed.

Inspecting new plants prior to planting to insure they are healthy.

Amending soil in planting areas as indicated by soil testing, to provide optimum conditions for plants to thrive, making them more resistant to diseases.  Critical factors include maintaining optimum soil pH and nutrient balance for the specific plants.

Placing ornamental plants with sufficient space around them for adequate light and air circulation in their mature size.

Assuring adequate water and fertilizer are applied to keep plants healthy and resistant to attack.

Careful pruning and clean-up of clippings.

Cleanup of pruning tools with isopropyl alcohol to prevent spread of insects, fungi, and other diseases.

Early detection and quick treatment is essential to minimize the need for pesticide application.  In addition to periodic surveys by the Integrated Pest Management Specialist (IPMS), ornamentals plants will be checked by all landscape staff who will alert the IPMS to suspected problems including spotting and yellowing of leaves, leaf drop, or other visible evidence of pests or disease.

Lacebugs damaging azaleas or rhododendrons:

Threshold:  Significant stippling and yellowing of leaves

If the infestation affects small areas, portions of plants, apply contact insecticide such as insecticidal soap or horticultural oil mixed with water
 


according to the manufacturer’s label.  If needed, repeat applications at 2- week intervals.

If the infestation is severe or does not subside after repeated treatment with regular insecticides, apply a foliar contact insecticide such as ASTROTM  (Permethrin 36.8%) mixed 4 to 8 ounces per 100 gallons of water in the spring when pupae are emerging and adult flies are present.

Leaf miners in boxwoods:

Threshold:  Noticeable leaf damage.

Apply foliar contact insecticide such as ASTROTM  or PERMETHRIN SFRTM (Permethrin 36.8%) mixed 4 to 8 ounces per 100 gallons of water in the spring when pupae are emerging and adult flies are present. This pesticide is highly toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment or residues on crops or weeds. Do not apply this product or allow it to drift to crops or weeds on which bees are actively foraging.

Japanese Beetle Grubs in turf:

Threshold:  10-12 grubs per square foot (cut and peel back the sod layer to Inspect during July - August)

Apply appropriate insecticide in accordance with the manufacturer’s label directions.

Powdery mildew on peonies:

Consider moving the plants to a location where there is less moisture and more sunlight.

Replace with plants more resistant to fungi in shaded, moist environments, such as Leucothoe.

Fungicide application is not recommended.

Fruit Trees

Preventive treatment is important for successful fruit production. Detailed instructions are available in Virginia Cooperative Extension Publication 422-023 Growing Apples in Virginia. Products needed will include dormant oil, fungicide such as IMMUNOXTM (Myclobutanil 1.55%) mixed ½ oz per gallon of water and insecticide such ASTROTM   or PERMETHRIN SFRTM  ( Permethrin 36.8%) mixed ½ tsp per gallon of water.  These may be used according to the following schedule:
 




Growth Stage	Timing		Pest		Treatment Dormant	Early April above 40oF	Insect eggs	Dormant oil
Green tips   Leaves out 1/8 inch   Insects, Fungi   Permethrin, Myclobutanil Tight cluster Flower buds tight Insects, Fungi Permethrin, Myclobutanil Blooming	(No spraying, harms bees)
Post-bloom  Petals are falling	Insects, Fungi Permethrin, Myclobutanil 10 days later	Insects, Fungi   Permethrin, Myclobutanil
10 days later	Insects, Fungi Permethrin, Myclobutanil Every 12 – 14 days thru mid-August   Insects, Fungi   Permethrin, Myclobutanil
(If lots of rain, do this after 10 days from last spray)

Aquatic Pest Control

Prevention is the key to the control of algae and weeds in Westhampton Lake. Careful adherence to the University’s Nutrient Management Plan (Moyer, 2013) will reduce algae and weed problems due to runoff of excess fertilizer from the landscape within the lake’s watershed.

Periodic draw-down of the water level will be used to reduce the populations of certain nuisance aquatic weeds.

If chemical application is needed, the least aggressive products will be used that achieve an acceptable level of control.

 
Algae
 

Threshold: When algae is evident.  It is critical to treat Chara and
Phormidium at the first signs of algal bloom.

Apply algaecide such as K-TEATM (Copper hydroxide 12.9%) at a rate of
0.7 to 3.4 gallons per acre-foot to visible algae populations.  Use the lower rate for planktonic algae, and the higher rate for mats of filamentous algae.
 

Duckweed and other floating and emerged weeds:
Threshold:  When duckweed covers 10% or more of the lake surface.

Apply aquatic herbicide such as REWARDTM (Diquat dibromide 37.3%) mixed at a rate of 1.5 to 3.0 ounces per gallon of water for water depths of 2 to 4 feet or RODEOTM (Glyphosate 53.8%) mixed at a rate of 2 ounces per gallon of water. Floating mats of vegetation may require retreatment after 24 hours.

","The University of Richmond is committed to developing a cultural shift across the university community to recognize that a sustainable landscape is a vital part of campus life. All new construction on campus avoids the use of irrigation systems by using native plants and less water-intensive plantings. Existing systems that require major renovations have been turned off and eliminated (example, Stern Plaza in the center of the historic campus). Sustainability is one of five themes in the campus master plan: ""The University of Richmond is committed to environmental sustainability and is addressing the challenge head-on, from education to conservation, purchasing policies to land management."" This influences practices in open space management. Recent redevelopment of the south campus has presented a rare opportunity to expand significantly the high-quality open space network of campus. 


","An Arboricultural Plan was completed in November of 2013 and is being utilized to assist in the management of 13 acres (144 trees) in the historic core of the campus. A Disc Golf Course was established on campus in 2011 in which 13 holes ran through a wooded area of campus. Dead trees were felled for safety reasons, logs ( some hollow) were left in place to benefit wildlife and reduce damage to the forest floor that would have resulted from their removal. In 2015, Landscape Services and the Office of Sustainability held two tree planting events in which students, faculty and staff planted 66 native trees, 4-7 feet tall. When new buildings are constructed, existing plant material and trees are moved when possible to other locations on campus. In the fall of 2015, plant material that is crowded and overgrown at an existing build was dug and replanted at a newly renovated dorm. This practice of transplanting crowded plant material is becoming standard practice. The controlling and managing of invasive species is ongoing, with the removal of invasive trees year round and the removal of invasive vines performed mainly in the winter months.","All landscaping waste, including grass trimmings, are recycled/composted at an off campus facility.","Organic compost is utilized in flower beds, new plant beds, when over seeding lawn areas, when required, to promote plant growth with reduced inorganic fertilizers. The Community Garden uses only organic soils and compost. ","In all new landscape construction projects and for plant replacements, native plants are given priority, ecologically appropriate plants are utilized at all times.","All new construction on campus avoids the use of irrigation systems and existing systems that require major renovations have been turned off and eliminated (example, Stern Plaza in the center of the historic campus). At the Westhampton Center, a Bio Retention garden was established during renovation. Watering is limited primarily to new plantings and maintaining existing plants and turf as necessary to keep plants alive, but not necessarily to maintain aesthetic quality.","Surfaces to be treated, walks, roadways and parking lots have been prioritized to reduce applications of ice melt products in low use areas. A bulk rock salt storage facility is being constructed to reduce run of from stored rock salt. ","A Community Garden for students, faculty and staff was established in the spring of 2009. The 1.5 acre garden is all organic, allowing no inorganic fertilizers or pesticides.",--,http://facilities.richmond.edu/services/landscape/index.html,"At this time only the Community Garden is maintained organically. The campus has a Nutrient Management Plan approved by the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), though this is not required for private universities. The plan is based on soil test and specific fertilization requirements set by the DCR based on the soil test. The Nutrient Management Plan does not require organic fertilizers, but does require that all nitrogen sources are 50% slow release. The plan is very strict in the use of phosphorus, which can be problematic when utilizing organic fertilizers as organic fertilizers contain phosphorus. If the soil test does not call for phosphorus, then it is very difficult to us an organic fertilizer. The existing 3 year plan expires the spring of 2016, a new plan will be prepared early in 2016, with the goal of utilizing organic fertilizers  as soil test and guidelines set by the DCR allow."

These grounds areas are maintained by contractors for athletics and campus recreation.

On the general campus grounds we use cultural practices to eliminate insect or disease problems such as pruning and  tipping back plant parts that are infested.  We also select plants that are resistance to common pests problems to reduce the populations to begin with.

Our two pest control technicians are conservative in their use of chemicals and use them as a last resort and only when economic thresholds are exceeded.  This means that we will only use chemical pest control measures when infestation levels threaten plant health. We do not use “preventative” spray programs except, on occasion when we may use pre-emerge herbicides in turfgrass areas but it is minimal.

The Integrated Pest Management Solution
Following the procedures of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, we focus our approach to treatment on eliminating pests, their harborage areas and their entry points to your facility to provide maximum effectiveness with minimal treatment.
IPM is a low or non-chemical alternative of controlling pests through the cooperative teamwork through improving sanitation awareness, proper building exclusion, and low or non-chemical methods of treatment to eliminate a pest infestation to protect the health and safety of employees and the environment.
Components of the IPM program include:
•	Inspection of your facility and its exterior surroundings 
•	Identification of the types of pests present 
•	Identification and investigation of conditions that contribute to infestations 
•	Analysis of current pest activity 
•	Recommendations for limiting and preventing future infestations 
•	Implementation of mechanical methods for controlling pests 
•	Application of highly targeted treatments 
•	Continuous evaluation and fine-tuning of service to meet future needs 
•	Education of your staff about actions that contribute to pest activity 
Non-chemical Pest Control Methods.  Non-chemical pest control methods are used where are feasible and efficacious. These include:
•	Sanitation (removing food & water sources) 
•	Exclusion 
•	Harborage Removal 
•	Harborage Denial 
•	Trapping & Monitoring 
•	Vacuuming 
•	Lighting 
1.	Sanitation: Sanitation involves cleaning up and/or removing potential food and water sources for pests. The fewer food sources that are present the fewer pests that can survive. Even something as simple as picking up a lemon that has rolled under a table can prevent a significant fruit fly infestation. A regular schedule of cleaning floors, equipment, floor drains, trash receptacles and dumpsters is the best approach to minimize food sources for pests. Water leaks should be repaired promptly, and wet mops should be hung up to dry properly. 
2.	Exclusion: Sealing up cracks and holes where pests can enter is the most effective non-chemical method to prevent pests from invading a building. It is impossible, for example, to keep a building free of mouse activity if the doors do not have proper weather-strips. It is important to keep outer doors closed or install tight-fitting screen or storm doors. 
3.	Harborage Removal: The less shelter that is available, the fewer number of pests that will be able to survive. Removing piles of debris, cutting tall weeds and eliminating cardboard boxes in storage rooms are examples of harborage removal. 
4.	Harborage Denial: If a harborage cannot be removed, e.g., cracks in interior walls where cockroaches could live, then steps should be taken to deny the pest use of that harborage. The most common procedure used to deny harborages is caulking cracks that may be present - both inside and outside. 
5.	Environmental Alteration: Changing the environmental conditions of a room or area so that pests cannot survive there can be an effective long-term strategy. For example, a wet crawlspace under a building can serve as a source of infestation for many different types of pests. Installing ventilators and vapor barriers to dry out the crawlspace prevents most pests from living under the building. 
6.	Interception: When building occupants or workers examine goods and items for pests as they are brought into the building, they often can prevent numerous introductions of pests, especially German cockroaches. This is especially important for food items, in particular bagged or boxed produce. 
7.	Trapping & Monitoring: Rodents can be effectively controlled in many situations using traps alone. Flying insects can be controlled with properly placed insect light traps in conjunction with good sanitation and exclusion practices. For insect control, traps work best for monitoring activity of insects and other arthropod pests. 
8.	Vacuuming: Physical removal of pests by vacuuming is rapidly gaining wide acceptance. This technique is especially effective for cockroach and spider control. 
9.	Heat & Freezing: Heat is currently being effectively used by Terminix in Florida and California to control termites and wood-boring beetles in structures in a process called CleanHeat. Terminix is also using heat in some situations to ""flush"" cockroaches out of their harborages. By combining vacuuming with flushing insects with hot air, pest control can effectively be accomplished in some situations without occupants having to vacate the area. Items (e.g., food) that are thought to be infested may be frozen at zero degrees Fahrenheit for at least 6 days - if the items can safely be frozen. 
10.	Lighting: Exterior lights often attract large numbers of nighttime flying insects to buildings where they can enter the building. These insects also serve as food for spiders, which promotes spider infestations. Exterior lighting should always be changed to sodium vapor lamps where feasible to attract as few insects as possible to a building. 
Contributing Conditions. At the heart of an effort to minimize pesticide usage and still maintain a relatively pest-free environment is the correction or elimination of conditions that may be contributing to a pest infestation. All pests need food, water, and shelter to survive. The less of these available to pests, the fewer number of pests that can survive in a given area.
In most cases, it is impossible to remove all of the food, water and shelter sources available to pests. A certain number of pests from the pest population will typically be able to survive.
Cleaning up food debris, fixing leaks and removing potential harborages accomplishes lowering the population size so that it will be easier to control the infestation while using a minimum of insecticide applications.
Facility Cooperation - Achieving goals of an IPM concept are difficult unless the facility provides its full cooperation in correcting the contributing conditions pointed out by the pest management professional. The longer these contributing conditions are allowed to persist, the greater the need to use pesticides to produce the goal of a pest-free environment.
Non-residual Pesticide Applications. Many people believe that IPM means that pesticides will not be used; however, IPM does not preclude the use of pesticides. In some cases, pesticides will need to be implemented, while in other cases, pesticides may not be needed at all. Every situation is different and the Terminix service professional is the person who must analyze the situation and choose the appropriate control measure including when and where to use pesticides.
If a pesticide application is required, ""low impact"" products or non-residual pesticides with acceptable efficacy should be chosen for IPM programs. Low impact insecticides include baits, naturally occurring materials such as boric acid and silica aerogel dusts, and pyrethroids. These materials generally have very low mammalian toxicity and still remain very effective at controlling insects and other arthropod pests.
Cultural Recommendation
A written sanitation report following each service outlining recommendations for addressing contributing conditions that may be present. To reduce the need for pesticide use, these recommendations should be corrected within a reasonable time frame. The following list details general recommendations to offer the staff of a facility.
•	Keep stored food products refrigerated or in tightly sealed containers. 
•	Dispose of packing materials, such as grocery bags, cardboard boxes, pallets and shipping boxes that may harbor pests. 
•	Change food suppliers to avoid future infestations. 
•	Identify and isolate foods infrequently used that have been a source of pest infestations. 
•	Upgrade food storage, waste handling and cleaning programs to reduce foods available to pests. 
•	Store goods on shelves away from walls to allow for cleaning behind them. 
•	Clean exterior and interior of ovens and hoods before grease buildups occur. 
•	Avoid leaving food and soiled dishes exposed overnight. 
•	Keep indoor garbage in lined and covered containers. Empty daily. 
•	Inspect for and clean up spills in trash rooms and around dumpsters. 
•	Monitor trash containers frequently and keep clean with fresh trash liners. 
•	Keep dumpster lids closed and drain plugs in place. 
•	Empty and clean recycling bins frequently. 
•	Empty mop buckets and remove sour rags from janitorial closets. 
•	Clean and screen floor drains. 
•	Regularly vacuum carpets, curtains, and upholstery. 
•	Remove lint accumulations from the edges of carpets, crevices, between floorboards, air ducts and registers. 
•	Remove unnecessary charts and crevices in exterior walls. 
•	Mount sinks and other fixtures away from walls to facilitate cleaning. 
•	Install tight exterior doors and loading dock doors fitted with anti-pest tension strips or sweeps and keep doors shut when not in use. 
•	Caulk crevices around doors, windows, vents, and other openings. 
•	Install insect proof screens on windows, vents, and other openings. 
•	Repair plumbing and roof leaks and reduce condensation problems. 
•	Drain puddles, including drip zones under air conditioners. 
•	Clean gutter and drains. 
•	Eliminate bird roosting sites and old nests in which pests can breed. 
•	Trim or remove foundation plantings, vines, and overhanging trees to reduce pest harborages and entry routes and to reduce moisture levels around the foundation. 
•	Keep grass short to remove cover for pests. 
•	Substitute trickle irrigation for overhead watering of trees and shrubs. 
•	Reduce the number of foundation plants, especially flowering perennials that attract pests. 
•	Avoid bringing insect-infested flowers indoors. 
•	Substitute crushed shells, stone, or gravel for bark or other organic mulches. 
•	Leave a bare strip of gravel or concrete around foundations to discourage invasion by outdoor pests. 
•	Use sodium vapor lamps outside to attract fewer flying insects. 
•	Move exterior lighting away from the building. 
•	Keep all exterior electrocuting-type light traps at least 50 feet from the building. 
•	Crumbs from lunches and snacks eaten outside of normal dining areas create feeding opportunities for pests in other sites. 
•	Insecticides used by occupants or maintenance personnel may scatter pests into new areas. 
•	Recently painted walls may cause pests to move to new areas because of temporary irritation from fumes. 
Monitoring. Un-baited ""sticky"" monitoring traps may be placed in key situations for pest activity to capture pests as they crawl along walls, in cabinets and similar areas. The purpose of monitoring is to determine which pests, if any, are present, to determine the extent of activity, to pinpoint where pest harborages might be located, and to determine where pests may be entering.
In general, monitoring traps should be placed under sinks and in some storage areas. Other areas where monitoring traps should be placed include motor compartments of coolers and kitchen equipment and in cabinets or on shelves where items cannot be easily removed on a frequent basis. Monitoring traps may be secured to both vertical as well as horizontal surfaces.
The primary focus of monitoring should be for cockroaches. A secondary use of these traps may be for monitoring occasional invaders, including silverfish, earwigs, crickets and spiders. Although these arthropods may not be specifically targeted pests for the IPM program, their capture may provide useful information.
If employees report seeing some unidentified crawling arthropod, e.g., spiders, monitoring traps should be placed in those areas to capture specimens for identification. Depending on the situation, long-term monitoring may then be initiated and maintained.
Additional monitoring traps may be placed in other areas as an aid in follow-up evaluation of treatments, especially for cockroaches. For follow-up evaluations, monitoring traps may be baited with a food attractant, such as a bit of banana or a spot of peanut butter.
Another type of monitoring for ants is known as ""pre-baiting."" When ants such as crazy ants, ghost ants, and Pharaoh ants are not present in sufficient numbers to readily observe ant trails back to the colony's location, peanut butter, jelly, Karo syrup etc., (without toxicant) may be placed along likely ant trails. After 15-60 minutes, a significant ant trail is often readily visible that can be followed to the source of the infestation - the colony's location.
Monitoring traps should be replaced when they become dusty, damaged, or capture a number of pests. The numbers of pest captured and where they are captured may be recorded. This information may be of future benefit to the overall IPM program.
Pheromone Traps. Traps, which use a sex attractant pheromone, may be used to monitor some species of food infesting beetles or moths. Areas where these traps should be used are large food storage rooms or warehouses.
Insect Light Traps. Insect light traps (ILTs) utilize ultraviolet UV light waves to attract flies and other flying insects to traps where they should be captured. Electrocuting traps use an electric grid to ""zap"" insects while other ILTs do not ""zap"" the insects, but rather use a glue trap behind or under the UV lights to passively capture insects. Whether ILTs will be beneficial and where they might be placed should be determined for each building during the initial IPM survey or in response to a specific flying insect situation.
Rodent Control Devices. Several types of traps and rodenticide bait stations are the two types of devices used to control rodent infestations. To eliminate a rodent infestation, every rat or mouse must find and interact with a device and then commit to that device. To achieve this goal, a variety of control devices need to be used in every rodent control situation. Using only one type of trap or relying on rodenticide baits alone usually results in failure to eliminate a rodent infestation.

GROUNDS MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
For
DE-ICING CAMPUS



SUPPLIES:

(1)	The Grounds Maintenance Department keeps about 500 lbs. of De-Icing Compound on hand in the Grounds Maintenance Warehouse.  If the need arises to order more during a storm, it usually is delivered the next day.  The use of chemicals should be limited to major building entrances, steps and handicapped ramps because of the danger of damaging concrete surfaces with the compound.  It is especially harmful to aggregate surfaces.  The De-Icing compound works well if the ice is fairly thin, the temperature is not below about 25°F, and the sun is shining or at least day light.  In the darkness, it usually just melts little holes in the ice that will then just re-freeze.  A bucket of De-Icer and sand are kept at ARRI (Automation and Robotics Research Institute), ARDC (Arlington Regional Data Center) and the Santa Fe building, for the Building Attendant to apply.

(2)	Bagged sand and bulk sand are kept on hand.  One utility scooter is equipped with a sand-spreading attachment.  Cyclone fertilizer spreaders are also used to spread sand.  The sand is used mainly on aggregate sidewalks in spots that have historically been problem areas, mostly in shady spots. These include the North side of the Life Science Building (where the aggregate walks had to be re-surfaced due to damage from De-Icing compound), the mall area between Ransom Hall and the University Center, the front entrance and steps at the Library and others.  Sand is also to be spread on the “sharp” curve at the intersection of West Nedderman and South Nedderman in the SW corner of the Davis hall parking lot.

(3)	For the Pedestrian Bridges over Cooper Street, rubber non-slip safety matting has been purchased to roll out over the top of the ice on the bridges.  Two (2) lanes 3ft wide for a total width of 6ft is to be laid on each of the three bridges.  The bridge on Mitchell Street can be treated with De-Icing compound.  However, use of this chemical is not to be used on the Cooper Street bridges as it will cause deterioration of the metal support structure as well as damage to vehicles passing below.  The rubber matting is to be stored in the equipment rooms below each bridge.  Each roll is a maximum length of approximately 32 ft.  At this length, the roll weighs approximately 125 lbs.  This is light enough for two people to safely carry over ice.

(4)	De-Icing maps are kept on hand ready to be used on the campus.  These maps show priority areas for De-Icing.  (See sample attached).  The estimated time to completely De-Ice the campus is two hours using 12 – 15 people.


PROCEDURES:

(1)	When the weather forecast predicts an accumulation of ice or snow, two (2) pickup trucks and the sanding scooter are to be parked inside the bay at the Grounds Maintenance Warehouse where they are to be loaded with chemicals, sand, shovels and gloves.

POLICY – De-Icing Campus
Page 2 of 2

(2)	A current list of employees and their phone numbers is kept on hand.  Everyone is briefed on procedures and the use of chemicals, supplies and equipment, and is provided with a De-Icing map of the campus.  Several Grounds Keepers that live near the campus are alerted to be ready to respond quickly, if they are phoned early in the morning.

(3)        If the weather forecasters’ predict a very good chance of 
freezing rain, ice or snow, people are asked, in advance, to report at 6:00am. If the ice event does not happen, these people resume their normal duties.

(4)	The Grounds Supervisor will check the weather conditions from his home starting around 5:00 a.m.  Depending on the severity of the accumulation, if there is only a small amount of patchy ice or snow that, in their judgment, would not be severe enough to close the University, they will phone a small crew to arrive on campus around 6:00 a.m.   De-Icing compound does not work well before daylight and often re-freezes if applied before daylight.

(5)	If there is a heavier accumulation, the inclement weather number is called for the announcement of whether the University will be open or closed.  Usually the announcement is made by 6:00 a.m., which allows time to call in a crew to start De-Icing procedures around 6:30 a.m. if the University were to open.
If the University has a delayed opening the entire Grounds Staff
reports to work two hours before the University opens.

(6)	As the De-Icing procedures start, first priority is to be given to the Student Health Center, the slippery tile steps at the Nursing Building and the pedestrian bridges.  Then complete the areas marked on the De-Icing map.  After that, give special attention to problem areas that have been noticed.  Then go back and start scraping ice off of steps, etc with shovels, if necessary.  Respond to calls from the Campus Police and others.  Barricades are to be placed at all entrances to the handicapped ramps at the center bridge over Cooper Street due to the steep grade.  Place barricades at the walk-over connection between Ransom, Carlisle and Preston Halls.  The De-Icing compound has, historically not worked well there because the area is shaded from sunlight and the walk-over remains slippery.

(7)	During the day, when the forecast predicts freezing temperatures for the night, clear away water on walking surfaces that would re-freeze if it were left standing.

(8)	If an announcement is made to close the campus on a regular class and work day, someone is to be sent as close to 8:00 a.m. as possible to check the greenhouse, water the plants and apply some De-Icer at the Student Health Center and at the Campus Police Station

(9)	After the inclement weather has improved and temperatures are to remain above freezing, sweep and wash the sand and the De-Icing compound off of the concrete areas.  Roll up the rubber matting on the bridges and put it back in the storage areas.  Re-order De-Icing compound and sand to replenish the stock.

Propane mowers are used to reduce the amount of CO emissions while eliminating our need for gas in those mowers. The mowers also mulch the grass and we do not bag the grass clippings.  This allows nutrients back into the soils without adding any chemicals to the landscape.  
The irrigation system is monitored 24/7 by a central irrigation system.  This system detects breaks and shuts off that zone in order to reduce water use and the programming is modified by live weather events on campus.  The distribution nozzles are low rate precipitation nozzles which lower the amount of water loss due to wind and lower the amount of runoff.  Drip irrigation is being utilized in some of the landscape beds to increase the efficiency in those areas.   All these features assist in having a sustainable irrigation system which goes hand in hand with a sustainable landscape management. ","Since the campus was established over 130 years ago and a majority of that area has been landscaped for 50 years, the only protection on existing vegetation is for the trees.  The campus within the last 5 years has spent over two million dollars to transplant trees on campus due to construction.  This process of transplanting due to construction is continuing with the construction of the new medical center.
Invasive species are mapped out along Waller Creek and scheduled for removal.  This process is done by staff and the assistance of students.
Experimenting with native grasses (Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center “Habiturf”) for better resilience in drought conditions is being done on campus.  Old outdated landscape is being replaced with new xeriscape beds where appropriate.","Landscape material is collected and brought back to landscape services office where small/medium tree limbs are put in brush box where they are taken offsite to be turned into mulch.  Leaves are added to a pile where they turn into compost and then mixed with soil to be used around campus.  
Large size tree limbs are being stored and will be used to create different types of furniture, office accessories, and award plaque. ","We use an application of local composts (vegetable and leaf mold), hummates, organic fertilizer, and greensand.
Soil sampling is used to determine any soil amendments. 
Aeration is used as needed to benefit soil health and root growth, and usually in conjunction with compost application.
Trees - Application of local composts (vegetable & leaf mold), mycorrhizae fungus, and organic fertilizers are incorporated into the soils through use of an Air Spade tool.
Remediation of compacted soils (through Air Spade tilling) in order to benefit root growth and long term tree health is being done on campus.
Utilizing local composted hardwood mulch in tree root zones and in landscape beds to benefit roots and soil, and reduce soil compaction.",The campus utilizes native and adaptive plant material that has been tested to survive in this area.  We are also working with different groups to design a landscape master plan for the campus.  This plan will provide additional native/adaptive plant material and practices that will lower maintenance requires but increase sustainability of the landscape.,The campus is starting to utilize bioswales to minimize the amount of runoff into our storm water system. We are also using Rain Water Harvesting on some of our newer buildings and working on implementing them for different areas around campus. More information on that is under the water section.,"Landscaping consults with Environmental Health & Safety annually in advance of severe weather warnings. Ice and snow are an infrequent event in South Texas, but despite the low threat, special precautions are taken so that Landscaping does not use chemicals or solids that threaten the health of Waller Creek and the campus's other natural features.

From mulching mowed grass clipping to prevent any need for bagging of leftover grass, to using low rate precipitation nozzles that reduce water loss and runoff, our team pays special attention to the needs of our environment with minimal impact when managing the campus landscape. A few other sustainable practices include:

-Drip Irrigation in landscape beds.
-Well monitored and tested campus irrigation system.
-Re-utilization of landscape waste by means of our composting operations.","At UT Dallas, landscape waste including tree limbs are shredded into mulch and reused on-campus. The Monarch Butterfly, a species of concern, is protected at UT Dallas as well. The development of a Monarch Waystation features diverse plant and insect life including milkweed, the flower at which Monarch Butterflies reproduce, feed and thrive during migration.","At UT Dallas, the collected landscape waste materials are integrated into the campus composting operations. Small and medium sized tree limbs are placed in a brush pile where they are eventually shredded down and reused on-campus. Leaves are collected on-campus in heavy duty, reusable bags. The leaves are collected on-campus and added with pre-consumer food waste to make compost, then mixed with soil and reused on-campus.

UT Dallas also harvests milkweed seeds from our Monarch Waystation to replenish the station. This reduces the demand for milkweed seed purchases from external parties which is protective of campus resources.","At UT Dallas, student, staff, and faculty managed community garden utilizes domestically and locally generated compost materials. The campus organic source of soil is generated through a composting operation where 100% of the landscape waste is reused on-campus grounds. Compost and mulch are added to beds across campus to improve soil quality. In 2015, 75 tons of compost was produced.","UT Dallas utilizes native and adaptable plant materials on-campus, in addition to maintaining existing landscapes. Organic compost and mulch are used liberally as soil amendment and weed control.","UT Dallas utilizes bioswales, rainwater harvesting, stormwater ponds, and native landscaping to minimize water loss and runoff. Bioswales have been added as part of new construction at the Student Service Building and Bioengineering and Science Building. Stormwater mitigation techniques improve the management of Cottonwood Creek that runs through campus.","The utilized snow and ice plan calls for sanding in explicit locations; the sanding plan precludes the use of salt in the mix. After an event, the university sweeps up the sand for reuse to prevent the material from flowing into the creeks.",UT Dallas has a certified Monarch Waystation that is recognized by the nonprofit organization Monarch Watch.

Grounds are maintained in accordance with IPM strategies that adhere to the four-tiered approach. The Plant Healthcare specialist is responsible for setting action thresholds and will recommend plant replacement in situations where plant material is likely to attract pests. When controls are used, biological controls, such as the use of nematodes, are prioritized.","The Athletics department at the University of Virginia is responsible for approximately 20 acres of sand based athletics field and turf grass areas with naturally occurring soils that are fertilized. There is no predominant soil type due to the construction process, but the department works closely with the University's office of Environmental Health and Safety to ensure that all regulations are followed. 

The sand-based athletic fields included in Scott stadium, Klockner stadium, Lannigan field and Davenport field are composed of both warm and cool season grasses. The landscape management adheres to the Nutrient Management Guidelines which explicitly address season of application and cautions, nutrient application for turf grass, area specific guidelines (i.e. turfgrass, athletic fields, sod), fertilizer rate, starter fertilizer rate, drop seder, and fertilization for landscape areas.

The institution also has a Nutrient Management Plan for the Inter-Mural Sports Recreation department. The Nutrient Management Plan explicitly outlines landscape management criteria's for various management areas: The Park, North Grounds Recreation Center, Copeley Field, Lambeth Field, Snyder Tennis Center, Madison Bowl, and the Aquatic and Fitness Center. 

Soil tests are conducted for each management area to show the acidic of each soil, and a regular liming program should be implemented. Liming is a critical management practice for maintaining soil pH at optimal levels for plant growth. Liming supplies the essential elements Ca and/or Mg, reduces the solubility and potential toxicity of Al and Mn, and increases the availability of several essential nutrients. The guideline also outlines the specific dates for when fertilizers must be applied. ","UVA prioritizes use of native, adapted, low-maintenance, and non-invasive plant species in landscape design and replacement.","The University Landscape Department operates its own composting facilities for weeds and other landscape trimmings. Grass trimmings are not collected and left in place. Woody material is sent through a chipper and reused on Grounds.

Moreover, the overwhelming majority of all the debris generated by the University's maintenance tasks remains on Grounds at our stockpile location.  The institution's woody waste is ground into wood chips for reuse as rough mulch and its non-woody waste is composted along with its leaves.    ",,"The institution focuses on low maintenance and noninvasive plants.  These may or may not be ""native"".","The University developed stormwater management master plans for the two watersheds (Meadow Creek and Moores Creek) that drain UVA property.  The plans outline strategies for mitigating the effects of stormwater runoff from existing and new development. In addition, the University is in the process of developing an Action Plan for demonstrating compliance with the Chesapeake Bay TMDL; this plan must be completed by 6/30/15.  Action Plans for demonstrating compliance with local stream TMDLs will also be prepared but are not due in the next year.

Moreover, cisterns for capturing rainwater for irrigation purposes are installed at the Astronomy Building (550 gal), New Cabell Hall (4,200 gal), Garrett Hall (5,000 gal), Amphitheater (6,600 gal), O-Hill Dining (10,000 gal) and Lannigan Track (187,025 gallons).  The largest two cisterns are directly connected to irrigation systems serving adjacent lawn areas.  The others are available for hand watering student gardens or for our landscaping crews to pump from to fill portable water tanks.

Furthermore, the institution has installed a variety of systems to filter rainwater before it leaves the property.  UVA has installed 16 oil-water separators, 1 oil-sand interceptor, 1 oil-grit separator, 3 sand interceptors, 1 StormScreen,  9  Filterras, 2 locations proprietary filter cartridges, 2 VortSentry. In addition other BMPs, such as raingardens and biofilters, naturally filter stormwater in addition to reducing the quantity of runoff. The institution also has bioretention filters or rain gardens installed at 11 sites across campus, with several more funded for installation as part of redevelopment and retrofit projects.  Several of the existing sites have multiple bioretention cells.

Additionally, the institution has two retention ponds - one at the Dell and one serving the Health Systems area.  The Dell pond treats the headwaters of Meadow Creek with a drainage area of 182 acres (approx 14% impervious) and has a forebay.  The Health Systems Pond has a drainage area of 34 acres.  We also have 7 extended detention basins and 8 detention basins.  Due to space constraints, we also have 17 locations of underground detention for peak runoff control.
UVA also employs constructed wetlands, infiltration, street sweeping, stream daylighting and stream restoration.

The institute also restores and maintains the integrity of the natural hydrology of the campus through the several cisterns that collect water for use at both times of draught and for landscaping establishment and gardening purposes.  These are described in detail in OP-27.  Since those cisterns are not metered, the rainwater collected and subsequently reused is not included in the totals above.

Lastly, starting in 2013, the University installed its first condensate recovery system.  This system captures air handler condensate (the liquid product of dehumidification) and sends it to our chiller plants for use in the cooling towers.  
","The University has reduced the use of rock salt first through use of a 1 part rock salt, 2 parts sand blend and more recently through significantly increased use of magnesium chloride for snow and ice removal. No urea products are used. The use of mechanical spreaders as a replacement for hand-spreading has significantly reduced the amount of material applied.

Rick Hopkins also manages and procures all of the products used for snow and ice control on all Academic, Housing, Medical Center and P&T locations.  The University uses bulk sodium chloride on the roads, parking lots and interconnecting sidewalks.  The institution also uses magnesium chloride on our steps, building entrances as well as sidewalks and it uses Sodium Acetate on the top decks of the parking garages.  The acetate based deicers are non-corrosive and not likely to harm the steel rebar in the concrete of the decks but they are very expensive so we use them only where absolutely necessary.  There are occasions when the national supply of magnesium has been used before the winter season has ended.  This happened this year requiring Hopkins to purchase 18 tons of Calcium Chloride to see the University through to the end of the year. ",,--,--,--

An impressive accomplishment since 50 years ago, the majority of the campus property was a farm field. As part of maintaining a long connection to the natural environment, sustainability is considered in landscape management decisions at the committee level (Biodiversity, Arboretum, Facilities Planning, and Student Government). ","The Grounds Department works closely with the Biodiversity Committee on campus to gather input on the best native species of trees and shrubs to use. We maintain a small tree nursery on campus with suggested native varieties of trees that are use in campus plantings. The species are very diversified to increase tree survival. When ordering woody shrubs and flowers, only local nurseries are used to ensure hardiness of plants in our growing region. ","UW - Green Bay composts tree and grass trimmings that are not mulched directly back into the landscape. Yard waste comes from campus grounds only, not the natural areas owned/managed by the University. ","When turf areas on campus are mowed, the cuttings are mulched back into the soil. Organic compost is added to formal planted areas on campus, as needed. ","Materials used in landscaping such as mulch or soil additions (compost, if needed) are locally sourced. The most environmentally benign materials are targeted for use on managed campus areas. ",The campus maintains a stormwater management plan that meets or exceeds all state and federal guidelines. A variety of managed landscapes such as bioswales and retention pond helps slow and clean runoff from hardscape surfaces on campus. ,"Snow and ice are a given in Green Bay. The Grounds department uses a variety of equipment and techniques for snow and ice control, allowing the best choice of options to tackle the given snow/ice accumulation in the most cost effective and environmentally friendly manner possible. Modern salters and sanders are used and equipment is upgraded as budgets allow. Different types of snow melt and salt/sand mixtures are used to obtain best results while using the least amount of product to keep campus safe. 

Sand, salt and ice melts are kept in a containted salt storage shed which is inpsected yearly by state facility inspectors. All employees are trained on equipment before applying any products. Hydraulic brooms are used on sidewalk areas to remove snow and ice. This keeps the pavement areas ice free most times and reduces the need for ice melts in most instances. When salting roads, the least amount of product is used to obtain a safe travel surface.

The campus purchases salt and ice melt through a state contract so products used are products that are chosen by state contracts. 

In winter, with the underground conscourse system between the majority of academic buildings, the campus closes most sidewalks and stairways that lead into people pockets located on the lower levels of campus buildings. This saves snow removal costs and reduces the amounts of ice melt needed on campus. 

At winter's end, all streets and parking lot curbs and surfaces are swept, removing any solids or contaminates which may enter the storm water drains. Any damaged turf areas are reseeded or resodded to keep turf areas healthy and vigorous so they continue to filter solids out of storm water.

Instead, we use a combination of mechanical, sanitation, and exclusion methods to alter habitat and remove things in the environment that would propagate a pest population. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/plantops/content.php?page=pest ","Vanderbilt grows about 2/3 of our annual flowers on-site in greenhouses. Perennials are split and transplanted as well. Annually, approximately 50 new trees are planted. Compost is made on-site using wood chips, leaves, grass clippings and plant materials and is then utilized on campus. Compost tea is made and sprayed on lawn and flower areas. Mulch is placed around trees and perennial beds to reduce watering. Leaves are mulched in the fall to add organic matter to lawns, tree areas and perennial areas. Each winter we dig up all annual bulbs and store them to be replanted in the spring. The University uses artesian well irrigation and centralized irrigation to reduce watering and use less water resources.","Vanderbilt landscapers utilize plants that are native to the areas in which they are planted, taking into account how naturally wet or dry the soil is, the amount of sun an area gets daily, and how well the soil drains after rainfall. This allows the beds to require less maintenance and encourages healthier plants.  For example, one of the Commons beds originally contained bearded iris, but the bed took on run off from a nearby building, so it always stayed wet.  Bearded irises hate wet feet.  Because iris is the flower mascot of The Commons, we instead used a native iris called Southern Flag which can grow in water.  This planting is now thriving and doing well.  Weeds are always present, but by mulching, hand pulling, using groundcover and minimal chemical use, weeds are controlled. ","The Plant Operations Grounds Department at Vanderbilt collects leaf and landscaping waste from campus to compost at an on-site location, resulting in 132 tons of compost each year.

","The Vanderbilt Plant Operations grounds department collects leaf and landscaping waste from campus to compost at an on-site location, resulting in 97 tons of compost each year. The mature landscaping compost is later used to fertilize Vanderbilt grounds, especially under trees.  Pine straw mulch is used to help keep weeds down, retain moisture, add organic matter to the soil, and for aesthetics. Annual flower beds are fertilized & mulched by organic mushroom compost as well as compost tea that is made on campus. Leaves are mulched and placed in lawn areas and shrub/perennial areas.","Weeds are controlled on campus primarily through mulching and hand pulling, and chemicals are avoided whenever possible. Compost tea and composted landscape waste are used as primary fertilizer sources. ","Permeable pavers are used to promote groundwater recharge. Plants that tolerate water well are used in locations that stay wet and those that tolerate less water are used in locations that are drier.  

VU is in the process of installing a centralized irrigation system called the Rainbird IQ. Currently fourteen IQ controllers are installed: four on the Commons campus and ten on the Peabody campus, with additional controllers being installed at the new College Halls at Kissam, which will open in fall 2014. The IQ will use a weather station that measures several different parameters such as rainfall, temperature, and historical ET (evapotranspiration). 
The IQ has settings that monitor these parameters and adjust irrigation. For example, heat and humidity levels are higher in July and August, so by measuring the ET, the systems will adjust by adding more time to each zone for watering to compensate for the evaporation rate. In the past, staff would adjust the controller up ten to fifteen minutes. The IQ will be very precise, giving the plants the minutes based on the weather that is happening in real time, thus saving Vanderbilt water and money. 
The IQ will also be equipped with a central rain gauge that we will default all controllers to off when a certain amount of rainfall is reached. The IQ is also equipped with a flow monitoring system which allows collects how much water is being used. The flow watch will also detect any breaks in the pipe that would prevent water from being wasted, by turning the system off and sending an alert.  The IQ has the potential to save Vanderbilt millions of gallons of water per year.

Each year lawns are dressed with Earthworks organic fertilizer to help establish and continue care for the topsoil.","Starting in 2013, the grounds team has switched to the use of more environmentally friendly products for central lawns. Corn Gluten a natural byproduct of the corn milling process and Fiesta(C) an Iron-based product are now used and were selected for their low impact on the environment and the community. 
For outlying lawns no products are used, opting instead for an organic approach that only entails regular mowing. ","Soil probes and close monitoring of the weather allow the Grounds team to keep track evapotranspiration and therefore allows irrigation to be adapted as the situation calls for it. On the athletic fields, watering is done early in the morning so as to limit water loss to evaporation. 
Rain gardens across campus help limit stormwater and nutrient runoff.

A multiyear research study monitors the 2 streams that run through campus for water quality and have been aided through the ongoing restoration of an native wetland garden that had first been established in the 1920s. ","Starting in the winter of 2013/2014, Vassar has switched to the use of salt brine solution of Magnesium Chloride that has enabled us to reduce our total salt usage by 50%. 
The brine solution is applied to roads and sidewalks ~24 hours prior to a winter precipitation event and works by preventing snow and ice from bonding with the pavement, making plowing more effective. In addition to the reduction in the total tonnage of salt, there are numerous benefits including reduced runoff, fewer corrosive impacts on vehicles, infrastructure and pets,

For stairs and entranceways Vassar uses Magic Minus Zero, a product of Sears Ecological Applications in Rome, NY (local business).

","The Wartburg College Campus Sustainability Plan addresses landscape management. This plan is written with eight sustainability related sections, the sixth being Campus Environment (Water, Land and Air Quality). The vision of this section is: The College will adopt best-management practices that improve air and water quality plus land practices that reduce run-off and improve biodiversity. Under this section, goals one through five address landscape of our campus.

     1. Irrigation Water Consumption: The College will adopt best-management practices for minimizing irrigation and increased use of graywater.
     2. Landscaping BMP’s: Follow best-management practices (BMP) in regard to landscape design and maintenance, including recommendations from the US Department of Energy’s Federal Energy Management Program. Considerations should be given to Xeriscaping, native plantings, no-mow zones, and biodiversity, etc.
     3. Organic Campus: The College will work toward using Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) listed pesticides and fertilizers on campus.
     4. Integrated Pest Management: Develop and follow a plan that conforms to the EPA IPM principals.11 Implementing integrated pest management (IPM) plans is important to address the issue of ridding the property of pests while avoiding methods that put the long-term health of students and staff at risk.
     5. Stormwater Management: The College will adopt best management practices for storm water control on campus as identified by environmental agencies such as Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Soil and Water Conservation District, etc.","The college tries to use native plants when possible and is working to be more conscious about doing so. Native plants are better designed for our frigid winters and hot summers, making it easier to maintain them. Plants in our area must be hardy, and flood and drought tolerant.

We are in a zone 2 watershed so everything written adheres to this specific zone policy which is part of DEP regulations; some parts of the campus, including the entire arboretum, are considered zone 1 are are even more highly protected.

We are dedicated to finding new and innovative ways of dealing with pests; Galerucella Beetles were introduced both naturally and as part of a student research project in 2007 and are providing biological control for one of the College’s most invasive species, Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria). Additionally, where possible the College is using “green” products such as Neem Oil and citric acid mixtures to control some insects and as an herbicide, respectively.","Our goal is to utilize cutting-edge techniques in our landscape, to promote our efforts actively and to generate interest nationally as a model institution. We are continuing to turn over more high maintenance areas to more naturalistic areas, including prioritizing native plantings. Providing excellent horticultural techniques promotes a healthier and mor resilient landscape.","The Wellesley College landscape is transitioning into a more naturalistic landscape which is more sustainable. Many high maintenance lawn areas are being returned to a more naturalistic state, which includes native plantings. This prioritizes native plants while increasing wildlife habitat; this also decreases the use of pesticides, irrigation, and fossil fueled equipment. ","The college composts 100% of yard waste generated on campus. The compost is mixed with other amendments, primarily sand, and is then re-used on campus for landscape projects. The college also grinds all woody debris including brush, trees, which are not utilized for firewood, and stumps to produce mulch. The landscape is an extremely high priority for the institution, we are very fortunate that our college is dedicated to preserving a natural and beautiful landscape for the community to enjoy. ","The college is dedicated to preservation of the natural landscape both by recycling waste generated in order to create soil and mulch which can be used elsewhere on campus and by limiting the chemicals that can and cannot be used on campus. As part of the Charles River Watershed, we have policy regulations of what chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, and otherwise) that can be used. We are constantly investigating more efficient operations and equipment to lessen environmental impact. Applications of fertilizers are now based on scientific soil analysis, applying fertilizers only as needed in specific formulations including organic. This is all balanced within the diverse needs of campus life while protecting and enhancing the more naturalistic areas of campus.

Our Edible Ecosystems Teaching Garden in particular is a site where the college explores the possibility of a naturally self-sufficient and self-maintaining ""forest"" of edibles for our use and without a need for human intervention into the nutrient cycle.

Those complete guidelines can be found at: http://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/factsheets/itpm-program

The highlights of the PennState Soil Science IPM approach to turfgrass management include:

1. Assessing Site Conditions and Characteristics. 
Collection of all site-related information affecting the health of turfgrasses and the degree to which they can withstand pest infestation, including amount of shade present,  density of ornamental plantings or other barriers surrounding the turf that may restrict air movement, soil fertility, soil compaction, drainage, the current cultural program, and how the turf is being used (recreational, athletic, aesthetic).

2. Conduct Pest Survey
Determining the identity, location, and populations of turfgrass weeds, insects, and diseases at the site and identifying the environmental conditions and times of the year that certain pests are likely to occur or cause damage.

3. Determining Pest Response Threshold Levels.
Using site and pest assessments, establish the pest response threshold levels for each pest based on aesthetics and the use of the turf. 

4. Developing a Monitoring and Record-Keeping Program. 
Monitoring techniques include frequent visual inspection of the site to detect early signs of disease activity (e.g. fungal infections) and well as monitoring current and forecast weather conditions to anticipate pest development and damage. 

5. The Decision-Making Process. 
The decision to implement pest control measures in a turfgrass IPM program involves using and interpreting information from the site assessment, the pest survey, pest response threshold levels, and the monitoring program. When and if a pest becomes a problem,  the proper control measures can be selected. Control options can include cultural practices, genetic controls, bio-rationals, and/or pesticide applications.

The decision to implement particular control options depends on several factors. These include the effectiveness of the control procedure, cost of the treatment, size of the area to be treated, availability of labor, availability of equipment necessary to do the job, and reaction of the end user. It is also important to consider any possible side effects that may result from your course of action, such as damage to the turf (phytotoxicity), nontarget effects (bird kills, leaching or runoff of pesticides, or enhancement of other pests), or the possibility that a pest will become resistant to a pesticide.
",We plan to develop a sustainable landscape master plan in the near future. ,"Where possible, the institution protects and maintains existing native vegetation, and replaces native trees and plants with like materials. 

With support from student organizations, like the Wells Campus Greens and F.O.R.C.E.S. (Friends of Recreation, Conservation and Environmental Stewardship), the Facilities Grounds group has engaged in invasive species ""pulls"" on campus, especially focusing on aggressive, non-native invasive plants like Black Swallowwort and garlic mustard. Grounds has collaborated with faculty in the Biology department and to conduct surveys of campus wooded areas to identify and monitor invasive species, like Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA - present in a limited infestation) and Emerald Ash Borer (not yet present). The College also collaborated with professionals from Cayuga County Planning and Cornell Cooperative Extension of Cayuga County to allow access for invasive species surveys, particularly focusing on HWA. ","The College removes leaf litter and other yard waste from campus sidewalks and roadways, and transports such material to another site on campus where it can compost. Some of the collected leaves are used to layer with spent coffee grounds from the student-run GRIND Coffeehouse on campus, in a vermiculture (worm composting) demonstration - the resulting compost will be used on the nearby student garden. Fallen leaves under landscape plants are generally left in place,  so they can provide valuable nutrients as they decompose. Facilities Grounds utilizes mowers with mulching blades so leaves and organic debris on mown lawn areas are ground into finer pieces that degrade naturally, providing valuable nutrients and soil enrichment. ","The College does not maintain any significant areas on campus in a certifiable organic manner, although many areas do not receive additional chemical inputs other than natural nutrients. ","The campus uses commercially composted manure from a nearby dairy farm for much of its soil amendment work, and purchases regionally produced, double-cut hardwood mulch for use around trees on campus. Currently, cuttings from last year's annual geranium plants used around campus trees are being rooted and overwintered in our campus greenhouse to reduce our need to purchase new landscape plants. ","There are several streams running through the campus, including two good-sized gorges. These areas are being retained as ""no development zones"" and are maintained as active riparian buffers for the Cayuga Lake Watershed. Referring back to the invasive species monitoring question, we are closely monitoring the small infestation of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid found in a recent survey, as the affected hemlocks are located in and around one of those large gorge areas. Any loss of those hemlocks would negatively impact their ability to provide stream shading and stream bank integrity. ","The College has switched from rock salt for ice management on sidewalks and campus roads to a more environmentally-friendly magnesium salt formulation that is non-toxic to humans and animals and less damaging to turf and hardscape surfaces (concrete) than sodium salt products, as well as having less of a negative environmental impact on the Cayuga Lake watershed. Snow is generally piled in areas where it will naturally melt and be absorbed into and filtered through soil, rather than run directly off into storm drains. 

In light snowfall conditions, sidewalks are cleared  either manually with snow shovels or with the use of hand-held leaf blowers, instead of heavy application of snowmelt chemicals. ","We have no certified or formally protected areas, although much of the campus is located in areas monitored by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as having some threatened plant, bird and animal species.

Such management practices include but are not limited to grinding our woody plant debris into usable landscape mulch to be applied back on campus. Using mowers that have mulching decks to return grass back to the soil which in turn takes advantage of the available nutrients and returns them back to the soil for plant uptake. In 2013 alone we used 250 gallons of recycled vegetable oil in our vegetable oil converted mower. Beet juice is added to our salt for ice removal. The beet juice lowers the eutectic temperature allowing the salt to be more effective at lower temperatures. Beet juice also aids in increasing the weight of the salt lowering the percentage of off target applications by reducing the “bounce off” effect. Compost is added to planting beds to help retain moisture which decreases water usage. The compost also helps to retain available nutrients while reducing fertilization. Automatic irrigation systems are in use to help control water usage. Roof top gardens are in place to help lower building heating and cooling cost plus deal with storm water.

This has been dealt with by using ET rates to better understand watering needs, watering during times when evaporation loss is reduced, using appropriate plant material, encouraging the development of our soils to help retain moisture rather than promote runoff. Landscape Services has been managing our plant waste by stockpiling then grinding into suitable mulch for our landscape.  Mulching mowers have eliminated the land fill usage needed to deal with grass clippings. Any plastic containers used for flowers are recycled at local recycling locations. Soilless plant mixes used for planting containers is composted later to be used in landscape beds. We continue to enhance and establish new storm water features to manage storm water.

Inorganic fertilizers have been replaced with organic grade fertilizers such as Milorganite in most areas. A few smaller turf areas are still fertilized with inorganics. Lawn areas are bi-annually aerated and some are top dressed with compost. Our lawns also benefit from the mulching mower decks that are used to return finely cut clippings back to the soil. We have also begun the process of using compost tea as a soil builder. We are currently in the process of improving our “brew” and finalizing a management plan for its use. Our tree care program also takes advantage of the planting process to improve soil life. Mycorrhizae and compost are incorporated into the planting hole soil to help with the establishment period and beyond. We also use leaf mold where appropriate to mulch. All landscaped trees are mulched using our hardwood mulch produced during our chipping process. We are also committed to working with our campus planning team to plan in the protection and installation of healthy soil.

While all are managed through IPM, the threshold for action on pests is different for each type.  For example, the game play fields are expected to meet NCAA standards and therefore require the most maintenance, both in terms of mowing and cultural practices and input of chemicals when pests do appear, or as occasional preventive measures in previously infested areas.  In contrast, the ""common grounds"" (most green space on campus) is managed with a very high tolerance for pests, and very little chemical input.","The goal for sustainable insect management is the same as weed
management: to first use natural preventative techniques, then use insecticides sparingly
and as effectively as possible. The primary cultural control for preventing insect
infestation is core aerating to remove thatch that would help insects thrive. ","When Williams replaces plant material on campus, we replace with native plant materials.  All plant designs are reviewed and approved by the college's Horticulturist.","All grass clippings are left on the grounds during mowing.  Other leafy waste from grounds keeping is transported to local farms for composting.  Woody waste is burned at the local Department Public Works shed for heat.  At times, wood chips are also taken to a local farm for composting.  ","We use pesticides as infrequently as possible.  We just live with dandelions, rather than spraying them.  When we do have to use pesticides, we usually use havlf the amount that is recommended.  We don't use any insecticides other than a preventative for white grubs.  We use fungicides as a preventative every 3-4 weeks from mid-June to the end of August.  ","We buy our mulch (double shredded bark mulch) from a lumber company in Ashfield Mass that makes mulch from their by-products from their lumber company.

The fertilizer Williams College uses is organic - Nature Safe.","The college does very little irrigation. None of the practice fields, common
grounds or meadow areas is irrigated. All of the water that these fields receive comes
from rainwater. The only turf that is irrigated is on the game fields (Priority A). They are
watered by permanent in-ground irrigation systems. The goal is to constantly maintain an
inch of water per vertical foot of soil per week. To save time and money, this is only a
rough estimate, evaluated by feeling soil samples and comparing to a chart to determine
relative moisture. These fields are also visually monitored daily for moisture stress by
looking for brown or wilting spots. The irrigation system is not set on a permanent timer
schedule. It is only turned on if the water level is getting low or if a hot, dry day is
predicted. This practice is important because the water that is used in the irrigation
system comes from Williamstown’s potable water source. A benefit of only watering as
necessary is that the game fields are irrigated to minimize the duration of leaf wetness.
This means watering early enough in the day that the grass is not damp when night falls.
Moisture encourages disease so minimizing leaf wetness discourages disease and reduces
the need for preventative and curative pesticides. ","Use sand and rock salt mix on roads and sidewalks.  Roads are not sanded until needed.  It is applied only after snow has been cleared.   At entryways, we use just magnesium chloride which is easier on the sidewalk and grounds and reduces sand and contaminants entering the buildings.  Magnesium chloride on the top deck of parking garage, due to the metal expansion joints. A sand / salt mixture reduces the amount of salt used.  Catch basins are cleaned annually. Mechanical equipment is used to control the amount of material applied.",,--,http://sustainability.williams.edu/files/2010/09/hannah_grounds.pdf,--

Periodic inspections are used to detect pest infestations before they each damaging levels. Bartlett arborists are trained to recognize beneficial insects that will help naturally suppress pest populations, and we also release beneficial to augment existing populations. When treatments are necessary, Bartlett uses organic and natural-based materials and reduced-risk products that provide effective pest suppression while protecting people and the environment. ",Grass is cut once every 5-10 working days. Normally aeration is not undertaken unless a specific lawn repair project is undertaken. Reseeding or resodding is generally done in the spring to repair bare spots resulting from winter damage. Weed control is practiced when weeds present a visible problem or when they affect approximately 10% of a lawn area. The campus has a growing selection of local perennial flowers that bloom throughout the season. There are augmented with local annual plantings in the spring and fall to highlight specific areas of campus. The care cycle for maintenance is every week to 10 days.

","WPI installed an environmentally sound and academically-interesting green roof on East Hall. The 5,000-square-foot plant-covered section of East Hall's roof improves the building's environment footprint in several ways, including handling and filtering storm water. The roof plantings include a combination of low-maintenance, drought-resistant specimens such as sedums, chives, hen, and chickens (a species of succulent plant) and ice plants, also know as Delospema. Most of the plants were selected not only for their ability to hold water, but also for their color and to provide a new habitat for birds, butterflies, and other species. In addition, a bioswale was created in the Higgins House parking low, providing natural sediment and contamination filtration from the parking lot run-off.",WPI uses magnesium chloride on all walks as it is a more plant-friendly option than sodium chloride for de-icing. ,,--,http://www.bartlett.com/commercial-insect-and-disease.cfm?cs,--
