The first step in our IPM program is to use appropriate measures to discourage the development of unwanted pest populations. Secondly, we routinely monitor our turf, trees and shrubs for any potential threats. Thirdly, we evaluate the need for any intervention with a pesticide product. Because of the continued bee research on campus we only use pesticides when it is absolutely necessary. If pesticides are required to control a pest population we will use the least toxic product at the lowest recommended rate. Our goal is to reduce or minimize risks to humans and the environment.","Our sustainable landscape goal is to provide a functional, aestheticaly pleasing, cost-efficient, environmentally friendly campus. We try to balance our intense management of athletic fields and centrally located high visibilty areas with limited or zero intervention in the remaining areas. All of our landscape decisions include discussions of the environmental impact and “doing the right thing”. Our current sustainability program includes, but is not limited to: composting yard waste, mulching mowers, IPM, irrigation efficiency, appropriate plant selections, mulch production, preservation of historic trees, green roofs, rain gardens and bioswales.

OSU's IPM plan aligns with EPA's plan in relationship to setting action thresholds, monitoring and identifying pests, and in prevention and control strategies. Environmental Health and Safety is responsible for ensuring that landscape services and all departments on campus follow proper IPM guidelines. ","While we do not have a formal sustainable landscape plan, the other details on this page specify OSU effort to minimize impacts from landscaping activities.  ","OSU acknowledges the importance of using native plant species in landscaping practices. According to OSU Facilities Services Manager Joe Majeski, ""Native plants are being incorporated into many of the new landscape areas. Also drought tolerant plants are used as well in many areas. We utilize a computerized irrigation system that measures: temperature, wind, humidity and rainfall and then meters just the amount of water required for optimal plant growth.""

Additionally, People's Park at OSU showcases native and drought tolerant plants to demonstrate more sustainable landscaping practices.  Fore more information: http://oregonstate.edu/sustainability/peoples-park 

A newer approach within the landscape crew is to convert smaller turf areas to sustainable shrub planting.  These small lawn areas are particularly resource in intensive and don't provide the same benefits that larger lawn areas do. 

For invasive species control, volunteer crews are used periodically to remove the two major invasive plants in this area: Himalayan blackberry and English ivy.  Many of these volunteer events are student focused and include a  service learning component. ","The use of compost or mulch waste is a priority set by landscapers at OSU. On-campus handling and chipping of woody debris and compostable material ensures these materials are returned to the soil. Grass clippings are left on the lawns to return nutrients. All leaves are composted on-site, and mulch and wood chips are applied to OSU grounds to reduce watering and weeding needs. 

All wood waste from landscaping is chipped on site and used on site.  Green waste, except that from invasive species, are processed on site.  Invasives are composted off site at a commercial facility.  ","Landscape crew has changed their practice to leave leaves in place. Leaves are moved into landscaped areas rather than being hauled away to compost at another part of campus.  In place composting under large plants and trees reduces transportation fuel, labor hours and provides year-round mulch for water and nutrient retention, and soil amendment. ","This is not currently included in OSU's efforts, with exception of some small permeable concrete areas for park benches. ","Several bioswales are in place on campus, and a major road reconstruction project in FY14 included a very large swale.  The Oldfield Animal Teaching Facility includes a vegetated swale with a small bridge over it near the entrance to a building, making these efforts as visible as possible. OSU assembled a water resources brochure to educate the public about the ways in which OSU is reducing its impact on water resources and consolidate information about this work.  It can be found at http://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/resources-visitors. ","OSU is located in a temperate climate that receives little snow but some ice on roadways. When needed, only products labeled as safe for the environment are used in ice removal. Steam distribution systems under many of the sidewalks on campus further help to melt ice.  When needed, a gravel/sand mix, rather than chemical treatments or salt, is used on roadways.  ","Protected areas at OSU include the following types of areas, counted in the acreage above: 
-LEED reserve
-Riparian protected areas 
-Highly Protected Significant Vegetation
-Conservation Reserve Enhancement

OSU's total protected land is 648 acres, of a Corvallis total of 1639 acres, which includes farmlands.  ",True,http://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/operations/natural-features,"Problems with STARS terminology make this credit challenging, particularly ""building footprint"" and ""undeveloped.""

The terminology for this credit is unclear and results in a questionable score. There is not guidance on whether or not sidewalks, parking lots and other impervious areas should be counted toward ""Footprint of the institution's buildings.""  OSU has this year reported only the acreage of the buildings themselves.  

Terminology used should include pervious, impervious and other conventional land use planning terms. ""Undeveloped land"" also lacks a clear definition. Undeveloped, as OSU has reported below, equals no impervious acres+no protected acres.  Where are impervious non building acres to be counted? How are farmlands with minimal management counted?


Additional notes on IPM:
OSU's Facilities Manager, Joe Majeski, has stated, ""IPM practices are used on all the grounds in accordance with state and federal laws.""  Below is the Oregon Department of Agriculture's IPM plan. Departments at OSU must develop IPM programs that are consistent with state laws. Oregon State's IMP guidelines are offered below to illustrate how the State's plan aligns with the EPA's four-tiered IPM plan. 

Definitions for ORS 634.650 to 634.665. As used in ORS 634.650 to 634.665:

(1) “Integrated pest management” means a coordinated decision-making and action process that uses the most appropriate pest control methods and strategy in an environmentally and economically sound manner to meet agency pest management objectives. The elements of integrated pest management include:
(a) Preventing pest problems;
(b) Monitoring for the presence of pests and pest damage;
(c) Establishing the density of the pest population, which may be set at zero, that can be tolerated or correlated with a damage level sufficient to warrant treatment of the problem based on health, public safety, economic or aesthetic thresholds;
(d) Treating pest problems to reduce populations below those levels established by damage thresholds using strategies that may include biological, cultural, mechanical and chemical control methods and that shall consider human health, ecological impact, feasibility and cost effectiveness; and
(e) Evaluating the effects and efficacy of pest treatments.
(2) “Pest” means any vertebrate or invertebrate animal, pathogen, parasitic plant, weed or similar or allied organism which can cause disease or damage to crops, trees, shrubs, grasses or other plants, humans, animals or property."

","Whenever possible, soils are amended with pre-consumer compost from on-campus compost piles or mushroom compost from a local mushroom farm.  Erosion of soils is limited by use of groundcover materials.","Whenever possible the landscape department reuses plant material throughout campus.  Tropical plants and some annuals are gathered into the greenhouse prior to frost to be used the following year.  This effort has grown significantly over the past three years.

The total campus acreage is 531 acres, of which 151.2 acres is Bartramian Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary (protected areas). Included within these protected areas is the 70.8 acre Macoskey Center property, which is managed in accordance with the documents submitted for LEED for Existing Buildings-Operations & Maintenance certification and includes both a landscape management program and an IPM plan.

Emphasis of the IPM is placed on integrating interior and exterior strategies, while employing non-chemical practices such as:
 - Exclusion, such as screening and caulking; 
 - Habitat modification , such as reducing the humidity in a room or thinning close-in shrubbery; 
 - Sanitation, such as eliminating organic matter buildup in drains or cafeteria equipment; 
 - Building maintenance, such as eliminating gaps around exterior door or sealing around utility entrances; 
 - Trapping, such as modifying or installing insect light traps; 
 - Monitoring, using insect or rodent glue boards or non-lethal rodent traps to capture pests. 
 - Use of least toxic chemicals as pesticides when absolutely required at specific locations for the targeted species.

The institution sub-contracts out many pest issues to the Leaf Pest Control company but oversees all operations. ","In addition to the Macoskey Center sustainable landscape management program submitted for LEED O&M certification, an additional 80.4 acres of the SRU campus are certified Bartramian Audubon Society Wildlife Sanctuaries and therefore protected natural areas (total protected area of campus is 151.2 acres of sanctuary that includes the Macoskey Center property). Riparian buffer zones have been established along all campus waterways in the Bartramian Audubon Sanctuaries.

The SRU Environmental Zoning Committee has also tagged specimen trees and identified outdoor classroom areas on campus to protect them from inadvertent damage. 
On developed portions of campus, LEED guidelines for the use of indigenous plantings are now being incorporated around new building sites; 10 foot wide riparian buffer zones are maintained around campus natural water features, and a system of natural streams/retention ponds are used to minimize stormwater overflows and sedimentation carry-over into the stormwater system. 

Plant Stewardship is accomplished at developed areas of campus by pruning trees and shrubs, using plants that will do well in this area, and preventing invasive species on campus from taking over(such as ivy growing up buildings). New tree plantings generally include trees that are native to this area such as maples and oaks. Each year  additional perennials are planted to reduce the need of annuals to the extent possible while maintaining the desired aesthetics of the campus. 

In general, SRU's grounds maintenance crews use low nitrogen, slow-release fertilizers to minimize loss of nitrogen due to run-off or volatilization; use of slow release fertilizer also saves on grounds tractor diesel fuel use as the number of applications is reduced. Compost from the Macoskey Center leaf collection and preconsumer food scrap compost program is now used in lieu of inorganic fertilizer at key landscape beds, which also use local bark mulch. Stone (river rock) is used in some beds to reduce the amount of mulch required each year. The amount of phosphorous admitted to the water table is also minimized by selecting products with little or no phosphorous content.Organic fertilizers are used in liquid form in the flower beds on campus. 

Liquid fungicides or insecticides are generally not used on campus, and only as a last resort if required to save an athletic field. Chemicals such as Roundup are used only to spot treat large populations of weeds along fence lines, at sidewalk cracks and building edges; similarly, herbicides labeled with a Caution Rating (least toxic) are used sparingly for weeds such as Ground Ivy.
","The SRU Environmental Zoning Committee oversees all uses of outdoor university property to avoid infringement on areas such as Audubon Wildlife Sanctuaries and outdoor classroom areas and to ensure appropriate, sustainable methods are used when any land use changes occur. 

In 2012, an official Land Use Project Request Form was introduced to make sure the appropriate entities (Sustainability Office, Facilities Grounds group, Environmental Zoning Committee, etc.) review any proposed temporary or permanent use of campus property and recommend native/ecologically appropriate plants and trees for proposed landscaping initiatives.

A Campus Trails Committee actively maintains our natural trail system, including removal of invasive plant species at the Overlook hiking/biking trail, and the Grounds crews also remove invasive plant species at other locations on campus.","SRU composts leaves from the community as well as pre-consumer food wastes from the dining halls at the Macoskey Center for Sustainable Systems Education and Research.  Using native wildflower plantings also decreases the amount of maintenance needed.

Waste minimization is achieved by mulching grass and leaves and/or collecting leaves for the Macoskey Center composting program, thus returning the nutrients to the soil. Any excess clippings that have to be removed from athletic fields to prevent them from killing the grass underneath are taken to the dumpsite and allowed to decompose naturally.

In regard to snow management, SRU uses snow melt systems at major building entrances and plows/manually removes snow first, in order to minimize the usage of salt. Bulk rock salt is used for streets and driveways, but we are attempting to minimize its use when economically practical in favor of a calcium product that requires less material to do the same job, therefore reducing the amount of chlorides added to the environment.","The Macoskey Center manages an extensive composting program (with the compost used for campus landscaping projects and/or gardens), and practices organic gardening in both the Market Gardens and the Community Gardens.","On developed portions of campus, LEED guidelines for the use of indigenous plantings are now being incorporated around new building sites. As described above, SRU minimizes the use of chlorides in managing snow and ice, uses organic compost from the Macoskey Center, avoids the use of liquid fungicides or herbicides whenever possible, and uses ""least toxic"" materials when absolutely needed. 

SRU's grounds maintenance crews use low nitrogen, slow-release fertilizers to minimize loss of nitrogen due to run-off or volatilization; use of slow release fertilizer also saves on grounds tractor diesel fuel use as the number of applications is reduced.

Environmentally friendly recycled plastic “lumber” benches are used on campus to replace deteriorated wooden benches, while reusing the original steel frames. 

A wind-powered lake aeration system uses renewable wind energy to oxygenate a retention pond on campus to inhibit the growth of harmful algae. This also educates people about the importance of good water quality.","SRU uses a campus stormwater retention system consisting of a series of connected streams and retention ponds to minimize stormwater overflow and soil erosion.  

A small solar-powered rainwater collection and drip irrigation system is used in the Smith Student Center East Parking Lot. It features a green area where an environmentally friendly rainwater collection system captures rainfall in an underground manhole, where a 65-watt pump distributes the water to a drip irrigation system serving the planters in this area. The pump is powered by a solar photovoltaic panel located on the roof of the building. 

In addition, the Smith Student Center West Parking Lot features an environmentally friendly stormwater bioswale, porous pavement, and three bioretention rain gardens that minimize soil erosion silt run-off by capturing/filtering stormwater runoff on-site, rather than channeling it to the municipal stormwater system","SRU uses snow-melting systems at major building entrances to minimize the use of chemicals, and  salting is normally only done after snow plowing/manual snow removal is completed when conditions require it (SRU does not typically salt in preparation for a potential storm). Calcium chloride is used as a salt alternative on new concrete as it is less harsh on the concrete and environment. ","SRU owns the following on-campus Bartramian Audubon Society Wildlife Sanctuaries: Storm Harbor Equestrian Center (23.7 acres), Macoskey Center for Sustainable Systems Education and Research (70.8 acres), Branchton Road Sanctuary (30.7 acres), South Main Street Sanctuary(16.0 acres), and the old Wally Rose Ballpark Sanctuary(10.0 acres). Other protected areas include selected outdoor classroom areas and the ecological research plots near the Storm Harbor equestrian Center.

Two additional, off-campus sanctuaries are also owned by SRU - the Old Stone House site and the Miller Forest on Wolf Creek.

The first step taken by the IPM coordinator was the creation of a pesticide application log to help WSU track the use and cost of pesticides each year. After employees became accustomed to this process, the IPM coordinator introduced and implemented the following four-tiered approach to Integrated Pest Management:

1-	Set  Action Thresholds

An action threshold is a percentage of pests to be tolerated in a particular area without taking any action to control them. The idea is that we cannot kill one hundred percent of the pests in nature so we allow a certain percentage to exist unchecked

The IPM coordinator set WSU's action thresholds as follows: ten percent for trees and shrubs, five percent for flower beds and turf, and one percent for extremely high visibility and marketing areas.

2-	Monitor for pests

Not every bug or weed in a landscape needs to be controlled as many are completely harmless to plants and people. Some such as lady bugs are actually beneficial to a plant.
Through monitoring, WSU first correctly identifies a potential pest before it becomes a problem and then takes appropriate action. This decreases the amount of pesticides WSU has to use which saves money and reduces harmful environmental impacts. 

To aid in this process the IPM coordinator created an IPM Landscape Monitoring Field Data Sheet and trained staff on how to use it effectively.

3-	Preventive cultural practices

WSU's Landscape Department believes that the best defense is a good offense, so their primary focus is on preventing a pest from ever getting out of control. Prevention is accomplished by first trying to select varieties of plants that are best for our growing conditions and the location of the planting and then great care is taken in the planting of that plant. WSU's Landscaping Department also tries to select pest resistant cultivars. These measures, along with proper sanitation of the plant sight, (no dead leaves and excessive weeds) help to maintain healthy plants. After all a stressed plant is a vulnerable plant.


4-	Control.

If a pest exceeds acceptable levels, the first control method to be used is mechanical control. This can be as simple as picking the bugs off of an infested plant, putting up insect barriers, using traps, or even vacuuming the plant.

If the infestation persists WSU then employs biological controls. These include predatory insects, naturally derived chemicals, microorganisms such as bt, or other entomopathogenic organisms.

If all these steps fail to control the outbreak, then WSU uses an application of non-restricted chemicals. Weber State does not use restricted chemical pesticides unless extraordinary circumstance dictate it. Using restricted chemicals requires the approval of the IPM coordinator and the Landscape Department manager.

",,,"Weber State University's composting program is implemented as follows:

1- Cut the grass, trim the trees and grind the branches, or cut the fall cuttings.
 
2- Haul to composting area and dump it in the correct labeled pile

3- Take from the pile and layer into one 30 ft x 10 ft pile (add 4 parts “Brown” to 1 part “Green”)

4- Water while building the pile to a consistency of a rung out sponge

5- Measure temperature every other day to see if pile is at 150 degrees

6- If at temperature, turn pile (put sides in the middle and put middle to the outside and water again to prior consistency)

7- Turn pile every two weeks until pile has quit reaching temperatures and decomposed (may take 4 months to break down completely)

8- Use decomposed material in flower beds and pots and in the turf
