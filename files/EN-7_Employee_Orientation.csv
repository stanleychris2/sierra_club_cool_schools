The orientation itself has also implemented sustainability. All new hires are provided with binders, and both the binders and all materials within them are 100% recyclable and made from recycled materials. The binders also consolidate many individual handouts into one piece, so it helps by eliminating paper. Benefits vendor information and handouts are now ""a la carte"" so new staff are only collecting the materials they want rather than excess materials they don't need or want. Other handouts at orientation include reusable grocery bags and a travel mug/cup to use.",--,--

Sustainability
Sac State recognizes the importance of campus sustainability and in being stewards of the Environment.  To ensure we are committed to sustainable practices, we have established a campus Sustainability Steering Committee with supporting sub-committees to guide campus sustainable policy and guidelines.  Sac State Sustainability focuses on sustainable initiatives through outreach, student involvement, and cultivating awareness and participation.  For any questions, please contact Kristina Cullen, Sustainability Analyst at (916) 278-7603 or sustainability@csus.edu.  Also, follow us on Facebook at “Sustainability at Sac State” and Twitter @GreenSacState.
Recycling
Every desk has a blue desk-side recycling bin and a black mini-bin. In the blue bin you can place all non-confidential paper documents, cardboard, most plastics and bottles & cans. The mini-bin is for trash and is significantly smaller to remind you that nearly anything can be recycled and deposited into your blue recycling bin as long as it has not been contaminated by food products. Please wash out your plastics. 
The University also recycles tires, toner & ink cartridges, e-waste, inert materials like concrete and clay, all its green waste and wood and a wide variety of metals too! To ensure these materials are recycled, Sac State offers these services free for the campus community. If you have any questions about recycling, please feel free to contact Joey Martinez, Recycling Coordinator at (916) 278-5801. To recycle batteries, please contact Environmental Health and Safety: (916) 278-5447. Happy Recycling Sac State!  
Energy Conservation
The University strongly promotes and practices energy conservation whenever practical and feasible. We attempt to maintain a balance between occupant comfort and energy saving strategies.  Over the years this concept has kept utility costs at a minimum, thus providing the ability to redirect the savings to educational programs.  The campus Energy Policy explains a number of strategies used to minimize energy consumption.  Please contact Nat Martin, Energy Conservation Coordinator at (916) 278-3696 for questions.

In addition, we point out the many ways to commute to work and around the campus with ride sharing, the Bull Runner, and the WeCar.

We also cover these items in the opening PowerPoint presentation for 500 new employees a year:
• Patel College of Global Sustainability offers a dual master’s degree in sustainability and green technology,  hosted a UN global meeting,  is part of the UN-Habitat Partner University Initiative, and  USF was the first North American university to join that initiative.
• We mention that USF ranked 12th on Sierra magazines “America’s coolest schools” list in 2012 for advances in sustainability in research and education, USF has a gold rating for building an environmentally-conscious campus, and USF has an NSF grant to turn wastewater in usable water.
• We cover the CUTR (Center for Urban Transportation Research)  and car-sharing initiatives including We-car, Zimride, the Bull Runner and U-pass with Hart.
