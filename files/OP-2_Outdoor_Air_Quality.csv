The campus is guided by Executive Order 987, AB-32, and our Sustainability Policy. The three constants contained in all three documents are as follows: reduce energy consumption, reduce GHG emissions, and increase renewable energy generation. 
Facilities Management:
One of the ways we have tried to achieve reductions in GHG emission as it relates to mobile sources, is we have installed 14 electric vehicle charging stations available for public use. This project was completed in the last 3 years.  There are four stations located in Parking Structure 1, seven located in Parking Structure 2, and three located in Parking Lot 1. We also have 2 additional electric vehicle charging station not for public use. One is located at Sacramento Hall for administration and one in Parking Structure 1 in a fenced in area for the University Transportation and Parking Services (UTAPS).
Another method Sac State has used to reduce mobile GHG emissions, is by phasing out gasoline powered vehicles. We now have 135 electric facility carts/small trucks. We have 6 forklifts which in the past were powered by diesel fuel, but were replace by propane powered over the last 3 years.  

University Transportation and Parking Services (UTAPS):
Beginning September 2015 Facilities Management Sustainability personnel began collecting post-consumer food waste for the express purpose of taking it to a local facility ""Clean World"" where it is processed into Bio Compacted Natural Gas. In our first semester with this new program we have delivered 26.49 tons of food waste that would have otherwise ended up in the landfill. The Bio CNG is then sold to our UTAPS department which uses it to power its entire Hornet Express fleet, which is a free service to any student with a valid One Card ID.
 “CNG vehicles emit 95% less pollution (depending on the pollutant) than a gasoline or diesel fueled vehicle. Natural gas is almost always significantly less expensive than petroleum, which means reduced fuel costs for Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) operators.”
http://csus.edu/aba/utaps/
Something else that UTAPS does to help ensure cleaner air is to have ‘Heat Maps’ on their Facebook page. These maps indicate which parking lots and parking structures are full(er) and should therefore be avoided. This leads to less time idling in cars which also helps to reduce carbon emissions.
https://www.facebook.com/SacStateUTAPS",True,"Records of all refrigerants used on campus are kept, as well refrigerant replacement because of leaks at each campus location where refrigeration equipment is used.  The majority of refrigerants used on campus are HCFC & HFC types, which represent approximately 74% of all refrigeration material used in all equipment on campus. However, the campus still has a few small systems on campus which still use R-22, which represent about 26% of our total refrigerant used on campus. These reports are updated annually. 
Sac State keeps records of the boilers and emergency generators usage and tracks the emissions.

Smoking is prohibited in any indoor area, in all University vehicles, and outdoor seating or viewing areas of sports arenas and recreational areas, such as those at Baker Field.  Smoking is also prohibited outdoors within 20 feet of all University buildings (including undergraduate housing).
Without in any way limiting the general rule, smoking is specifically prohibited in the following areas at the University: auditoriums, classrooms, conference rooms, meeting rooms, laboratories and storage areas, employee or student lounges, theaters, clubhouses, elevators, hallways, stairwells, restrooms, undergraduate apartment buildings or residence halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, employee or student medical facilities, rooms or areas containing photocopying or other equipment used by employees or students in common, food markets or other retail stores, restaurants, cafeterias and dining facilities (including the Faculty House), and bars or other places in which alcoholic or other beverages are served.
Notwithstanding the above descriptions of locations where smoking is prohibited or permitted, smoking is prohibited in any area with signage indicating that smoking is prohibited. Smoking is entirely restricted except for 15 designated outdoor locations.  
Employees at the Medical Center Campus are required to obey campus-specific smoking policies along with New York Presbyterian Hospital applicable to hospital premises.  Violations of the hospital's policies by University employees will be considered violations of this policy.
This policy will also be applied to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Nevis Laboratories unless local laws in those two locations were to require more restrictive practices.

Applicability:
This policy applies to the operation of any vehicle on Green Mountain College property.

Rationale:
Exhaust from idling vehicles can accumulate and pose a health risk to employees, drivers, and the community at large. Exposure to exhaust can cause lung damage and respiratory problems. Exhaust also exacerbates asthma and existing allergies, and long-term exposure is thought to increase the risk of lung cancer. Idling vehicles also waste fuel and financial resources and contribute to global warming. Idling is bad for the environment and bad for the bottom line.

Purpose:
To minimize idling time in all aspects of facility vehicle operation.

Guidance:
•When drivers arrive at loading or unloading areas to drop off or pick up passengers, they should turn off their vehicles as soon as possible to eliminate idling time and reduce harmful emissions. Vehicles should not be restarted until passengers are ready to depart and there is a clear path by which to exit the pickup area. Exceptions include conditions that would compromise passenger safety, such as:
     - extreme weather
     - idling in traffic
•At bus and facility vehicle depots, limit idling time during early-morning warm-up to what is recommended by the vehicle manufacturer (generally 3 to 5 minutes) in all but the coldest weather.
•All service delivery vehicles should turn off their engines while making deliveries to the facility.
•All drivers of any vendor or GMC vehicle should receive a copy of this bulletin and be encouraged to discuss it at the beginning of every year.

Approved by Cabinet Spring 2011",True,"On March 31st and April 29th, 2011, emissions testing was performed on our wood-fired boiler by Gammie Air Monitoring (GAM) to assess levels of carbon monoxide and total particulates. The wood-fired boiler is our only potentially significant stationary source of air pollutants on campus. The methodology and results were reviewed by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation: Air Pollution Control Division. Based on the findings, the Division concluded that the particulate and carbon monoxide emissions from the boiler were well below the Permit's emission limits under the conditions existing at the time (see the paragraph below for greater detail on the results). Since we have not significantly changed operations of the boiler since then, we think this testing is a good representation of the rate of emissions coming from the plant. Therefore, we conclude that we do not have ""significant air emissions"" from stationary sources, and thus do not have to submit a full inventory to pursue this credit.

Detailed results of the test:
Both particulate matter and carbon monoxide were both well below the permit limits at the time of testing. Total particulates (without condensables) were .06 lbs/hr and the permit limits were .98. Emissions in lbs/MMBTU were .009 and permit limits were .057. Total particulates (with condensables) were .007 gr/dscf at 12% CO2, well under the limit of .2. For carbon monoxide, results were 8 ppm at 12% CO2, significantly under the permit limit of 150.

Thus, we have to report 0 for each of the
above fields due to the fact that the credit cannot be submitted unless those fields are populated. Regardless, we believe the emissions test shows that the biomass plant is not a significant source of emissions and thus, we are exempt from having to submit a full inventory to pursue this credit.

(2) Rice consistently falls underneath its emissions cap.  As such, with the cap and trade program, Rice has the option of going out and selling its remaining allowances; however, the University chooses not to, thereby preventing additional pollution in the region.  

(3) Rice tends to perform tests on generating equipment during non-peak hours. 

(4) Rice participates in various programs to reduce electricity consumption during peak hours by fuel switching to natural gas cogeneration on-campus.  This is cleaner than what would be generated off-site. Thus, while it adds to Rice’s on-site emissions, it reduces the total region-wide emissions.

•	Verified and reinforced through environmental audits
•	Ensured through training and certification of responsible personnel

UBC has also included Metro Vancouver Non-Road Diesel Engine Emission Regulations bylaw in its Air Quality Management Procedure, and relevant responsible persons are alerted and trained to identify such equipment and verify compliance when relevant.

UBC’s Building Operations fleet, which operates 240 vehicles or approximately half the campus fleet, received Canada’s first E3 Platinum Certification in 2014 for sustainable fleet management. As part of the certification process, The UBC Anti-Idling policy was formally approved and distributed in 2012. This policy’s purpose is to protect public health and improve the environment by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and urban noise while conserving fuel. The policy states that an operator of a motor vehicle must not leave engine idling for longer than three consecutive minutes in a sixty minute period. Further, an operator of a motor vehicle must not leave engine idling while vehicle is unattended and unlocked. 

In the context of the E3 program, an idling baseline was completed for calendar year 2012. The results approximated that idling wastes 35,611L of fuel each year, equivalent to 43 tons of GHG emissions. UBC Building Operations’ target is to achieve a 15% reduction in idling occurrences by 2015; this will be accomplished through a combination of training, monitoring and enforcement of the policy.

Improved efficiency from this project alone is expected to save 24% of the natural gas currently consumed by the existing Power House, approximately 240,000 GJ/yr of natural gas. The new boilers will also meet more stringent ultra-low NOx air emissions standards.

UBC also developed a unique standardized assessment and mitigation protocol to allow for risk assessment, upgrade of emission controls, and re-evaluation to demonstrate risk mitigation for design standards of residential buildings located near research buildings to ensure higher air quality controls and measures are in place.",http://www.riskmanagement.ubc.ca/environment/national-pollutant-release-inventory-0,--

I. Procedures
The University’s “General Procedures regarding Idling on Campus"" sets certain guidelines and restrictions for the idling of a vehicle by any member of the university community be they faculty, retired faculty, administrator, professional exempt staff, classified staff, temporary employee, student, contractor or any individual or company using university property, equipment or resources. These procedures are consistent with Colorado House Bill 11-1275 and Colorado Revised Statutes 42-4-1206.
III. PURPOSE 
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines to reduce resource consumption and emissions release through the reduction of unnecessary vehicular idling, to improve the air quality on campus and reduce vehicle theft.
V. PROCEDURES 
 	A. Idling Reduction: 

The following limitations are to be followed for any vehicle operating on the UCCS campus and for any UCCS fleet vehicle whenever in operation. 
1. No person shall allow a vehicle to idle for more than five (5) minutes in any one-hour period unless:
(1) The ambient outside air temperature has been less than twenty (20) degrees Fahrenheit for each hour of the previous twenty-four (24) hour period; or 
(2) The latest hourly ambient outside air temperature is less than ten (10) degrees Fahrenheit

2. Vehicles shall never be left idling when unattended. Colorado Revised Statute 42-4-1206, more commonly known as the ""puffer"" law, allows law enforcement officers across the state to immediately ticket individuals who have left a vehicle running unattended for any period of time.

B. Idling Exceptions: 

Exceptions to this guideline have been identified for the following circumstances: 

a) When idling for up to twenty minutes in any sixty-minute period if the ambient temperature is less than ten degrees.
b) When it remains motionless because of highway traffic, an official traffic control device or signal, or at the direction of a law enforcement officer;
c) When the driver is operating defrosters, heaters, or air conditioners or is installing equipment only to prevent a safety or health emergency, and not for rest periods;
d) In the case of a law enforcement, emergency, public safety, or military vehicle, or any other vehicle used to respond to an emergency, when it is responding to an emergency or being used for training for an emergency, and not for the convenience of the vehicle operator;
e) When necessary for required maintenance, servicing, or repair of the vehicle;
f) During a local, state, or federal inspection verifying that the equipment is in good working order if required for the inspection;
g) During the operation of power take-off equipment if necessary for operating work-related mechanical or electrical equipment;
h) In the case of an armored vehicle, when a person is inside the vehicle to guard its contents or during the loading or unloading of the vehicle;
i) University shuttle buses. See Attachment C

2. Grants have allowed the University to install 5 electric vehicle charging stations across campus. These stations are free of charge to the public for the first 5 years of operation. Additionally, in February 2015, UConn signed the U.S. Department of Energy’s Workplace Charging Challenge which requires the University to develop plans to assess and promote electric vehicle use on campus. As the electric vehicle infrastructure at UConn develops, outdoor air quality can be improved by reducing the number of fuel burning cars on campus.

http://ecohusky.uconn.edu/transportation/electric-vehicles.html

3. The University also works to promote alternative forms of transportation other than personal vehicles. UConn has an extensive public transportation network and a new bike sharing program. A transportation fee is included in student’s fee bills that funds the operation of UConn’s fleet of shuttle buses. The Windham Region Transit District also offers buses that travel from UConn to Willimantic free of charge and large bus companies like Peter Pan and Greyhound serve UConn. Furthermore, UConn Recreation deployed UConn Cycle Share last semester that enables students to rent a bike for a week or the entire semester for free. All of these options help to reduce outdoor air pollutants by reducing the number of cars in use on campus.

4. UConn has developed a commuter carpool tool to help facilitate carpooling for commuting faculty, staff, and students. This tool allows people in the surrounding areas to connect with each other to coordinate ride sharing.

5. The University received a $260,000 grant from the Connecticut Department of Transportation to purchase electric vehicles to replace the older vehicles in UConn’s transportation fleet. Furthermore, UConn’s light duty fleet is now 15% Alternative Fuel Vehicles (27 of 184 total vehicles). It is expected that this will increase to 18% in May of 2016 and 25% by 2025. Currently, UConn has 12 electric vehicles and 15 hybrids. These new vehicles help to further reduce outdoor air pollution at the Storrs campus.
http://today.uconn.edu/blog/2013/09/uconn-getting-green-for-going-green/

6. As part of the Green Campus Academic Network (a program to engage new faculty members in campus sustainability), Dr. Kristina Wagstrom had students enrolled in her Transport and Transportation of Air Pollutants class in the fall semester of 2015 assess and monitor air pollution on campus.

7. A Sustainability Framework Plan accompanied UConn’s Campus Master Plan in 2015 and it sets specific sustainability goals related to the movement of people (expansion of bike-sharing program, alternative fuel vehicles, reducing single occupancy vehicles, etc. (pp 13)

http://ecohusky.uconn.edu/docs/development/Sustainability%20Framework%20Plan.pdf",True,"The University uses a combination of methodologies to track emissions from our fuel burning sources of emissions. For most sources, UConn tracks fuel use and/or hours of operation and applies a standard emissions factor (EPA AP-42, manufacturer’s guarantee, or from stack test results) with worst case assumptions. For one particular boiler, the University uses actual continuous emission monitoring data for NOx. Every month a new 12-month rolling total is calculated for the emissions categories to demonstrate permit compliance.

All new buildings and renovations over $5 million are required to meet LEED Silver certification. It is expected by the end of the spring 2016 semester that the University will adopt a new policy that will make LEED Gold the minimum standard.

We have also reduced emissions by centralizing more buildings on our highly-efficient, 25MW campus cogeneration facility, which powers around 90% of our main campus.  This reduces use of electricity, heating and cooling from less efficient stationary sources. We have also reduced emissions by installing renewable and clean energy sources when and where feasible.  For example our 400 kW fuel cell installed in 2012, reduces CO2 by more than 800 tons per year and also reduces other forms of pollutants (NOx, SOx, VOCs, HAPs) from conventional generating or fuel-burning CHP sources. We also use more conventional sources of air pollution control technologies pursuant to state and federal air permits and regulations, including SCR at the co-gen power plant and other technologies needed to comply with LAER, BACT, and RACT. UConn also uses only ultra-low sulfur fuel in its diesel-fired emergency generators.

As a signatory of Second Nature’s Carbon Commitment the University has pledged to be a net-zero carbon emitter by 2050. Despite, the expected growth of the campus through the $1.5 billion Next Generation Connecticut program, UConn is still on track to meet its 20% interim reduction goal by 2020. This is being achieved primarily through on-going LED re-lamping projects in buildings, parking lots, and walkways and with the replacement of old, inefficient steam pipes. These projects are expected to be completed between 2015 and 2020 and will yield an annual 13,265 ton reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

Policy:
This shall apply to all vehicles owned by the University of Louisville or its affiliates or operated by any employee or contractor of the university during the course of their job duties at the university. All UofL personnel or agents of UofL that operate a vehicle or powered equipment shall be made aware of this policy prior to operations and refreshed as necessary.
All vehicles should be turned off when not in use or when the driver leaves the vehicle for any length of time. Equipment should not be left idling more than 1 minute and should be turned off unless doing so would hurt its operation.

Exceptions:
• Vehicles at job sites requiring the use of emergency lights or other powered accessories to accomplish their assignment.
• Department of Public Safety vehicles are exempted during emergency and training situations.
• Inclement weather situations where the supervisor authorizes the use of the vehicle/equipment heater-defroster for the work crew’s comfort when the temperature is below freezing or over 90 degrees. In these situations vehicle may idle for 5 minutes for heating/cooling. At no time should the vehicle be left unattended.

Background:
Unnecessary idling poses a risk to people in the vicinity and to the environment. Engine emissions are increasingly connected to a wide variety of health complaints. Automobile exhaust leads to tropospheric ozone formation and other forms of air pollution. It also releases greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, a major contributor to global climate change. No-idling is a simple and cost-effective way to reduce emissions and protect health.
Vehicles idling get zero miles per gallon. Unnecessary idling wastes fuel and pollutes. Running an engine at a low speed also causes more wear and tear on the vehicle. Studies have shown that the break-even point of turning an engine off and restarting it as compared to leaving it on to idle is 30 seconds.

Guidance:
Drivers of vehicles should turn off their vehicles as soon as possible to reduce idling and harmful emissions. Vehicles should be turned off when unloading passengers or goods. Buses should not idle while waiting for students during field trips, athletic events or other events using buses. Engines of service vehicles should be turned off while making deliveries. Vehicles should be turned off while waiting at train crossings.
