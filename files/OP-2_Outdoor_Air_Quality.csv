The first step in the was for the UT Pan Am EH&S department to contact the campus maintenance department to gather information needed to calculate emissions. This was accomplished via an e-mail sent to the individuals responsible for various areas of the campus. The e-mail requested that the responsible individuals identify all potential sources of air emissions in their areas and included a preliminary listing of typical emission sources at Universities taken from the December 8, 1997 Seminar materials and carried out through 2002. The EH&S department also requested that pertinent data on capacities (i.e., firing rates for boilers) that may affect emission potential be gathered.
This information was then compiled and provided to EH&S for its review. Upon completing its review EH&S and UT Pan Am participated in a teleconference to discuss the sources of information, factors that would pose physical or operational limits on emissions potential, and conservative assumptions that might be used in the analysis. The teleconference was also used to identify any additional information that was needed to calculate emissions. This additional information was then gathered by UT Pan Am and provided to EH&S.
The information was used along with published emission factors, mass balance principles, and conservative assumptions as appropriate to obtain a conservative estimate of site-wide PTE as documented in Section 3.0 of this report. A draft version of this report was then provided to UT Pan Am for its review, and UT Pan Am’s subsequent comments incorporated as appropriate into this final document.",**,54.76,1.5,12.46,--,--,--,--,--,--,,https://portal.utpa.edu/utpa_main/dba_home/safety_home/EHS_FILES_pAGE/3804FD541F9D1CE6E044000E7F4F73A4,--
