Maintenance uses a number of contractors and suppliers in the Newark area for painting, electrical & plumbing work, paving, concrete work, as well as for general construction.

All major construction projects utilize local central ohio contractors except when project expertise cannot be found locally e.g. our new field turf at our stadium.

To our knowledge none of the local businesses are classified as ""disadvantaged"" and we don't know if other suppliers, not in Granville, are classified as disadvantaged or social enterprises.  If any, the percentage of purchases is probably very low from either of these classes.  ",True,35.0,--,--

""Where possible, vendors are encouraged to use second-tier suppliers in close proximity to Duke. The use of local minority and women-owned businesses strengthens our commitment to the local economy.""
An excerpt from Duke’s governing Terms and Conditions states:
Duke maintains a voluntary Supplier Diversity Program in order to provide an equitable competitive environment for historically underutilized business sectors. Diverse Suppliers are firms that are small, disadvantaged, woman, veteran, service-disabled veteran, HubZone or LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) owned. Ownership refers to at least 51% financial control as well as operational management.

Diverse Suppliers are recognized with appropriate documentation of ownership status as certified by a recognized certifying organization or agency. Recognized certifying bodies include: U.S. Small Business Administration, N.C. Department of Historically Underutilized Business, Durham Department of Equal Opportunity / Equity Assurance, National Minority Supplier Development Council, North Carolina Minority Supplier Development Council, Women’s Business Enterprise National Council, National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, as well as local, regional, city and state certifying agencies.

In addition to primary suppliers, Duke pursues maximum participation through second-tier efforts. Primary contractors must submit a plan for their involvement with diverse second-tier suppliers. Following Purchase Order/Agreement award, the Contractor is required to maintain both first and second-tier efforts and submit quarterly progress reports.

By taking an active role in working with Diverse Suppliers, Duke can optimize price, service, and delivery conditions while building the local community and economy. Supplier diversity will be one, but not the sole, consideration in all Purchase Order/Agreement awards.

Per GW's Standard Terms & Conditions (for supplier contracts):

Section C5. Supplier Diversity Initiative Program (MBE/WBE).

The University voluntarily maintains a Supplier Diversity Initiative Program as part of its efforts to increase participation of minority and women vendors (MBE/WBE). GW seeks to achieve this goal through primary and second-tier suppliers. All primary suppliers must submit a plan with their bids, indicating how they intend to use minority and women vendors as their second-tier suppliers. Each plan will be evaluated based on good-faith efforts and will consider the following factors:

-- Availability of minority/women vendors who can supply the goods and services requested in the bid documents
-- Competitiveness of the prospective second-tier suppliers.

The use of local minority and women-owned businesses strengthens our commitment to the local community. In all cases, however, it is expected that the vendors meet the criteria relating to price, service, and delivery. Supplier diversity will be one, but not the sole, consideration in all contract awards. Ultimately it will be left to the discretion of the primary supplier as to which second-tier suppliers it uses. When a contract is awarded, the supplier is required to maintain its second-tier effort and to submit monthly reports on its progress.",True,44.08,http://www.financeoffice.gwu.edu/procurement/Documents/PDF/termsandcond.pdf,"GW tracks diversity and local spend via Tableau.  A copy of the spend analysis for the last three fiscal years is attached.  GW recognizes the SBA categorization of businesses, as well as the Certified business categories as established by the District of Columbia, State of Maryland and Commonwealth of Virginia.

Moving forward, the President's Council on Diversity and Inclusion will evaluate the university's existing contracts with local, underrepresented communities within the District. Based on findings, which are anticipated to be fairly limited, an intentional action will be undertaken to increase the numbers of minority and women-owned businesses located within and supporting low-income areas.

PSU strongly supports federal, state, and local efforts to promote economic growth and prosperity. In its efforts to encourage economic growth and development PSU is continuously improving relationships with MWESB vendors and increasing contracting efforts with these firms.  Since the modification of our W-9 in 2009, PSU’s ability to track utilization of MWESB's and identify targeted areas for increased engagement with MWESB vendors has been greatly improved.  The modified form has made it easier for vendors who are certified by the State of Oregon or who are self-reporting to identify as MWESB vendors. Additionally, PSU’s new Diversity Action Plan (DAP) promotes the development of stronger ties with the MWESB community as exemplified by the College of Business Administrations’ award winning Business Outreach Program (BOP). 

Portland State University is committed to utilizing MW/ESB vendors. For a link to State of Oregon MW/ESB certified vendors: http://www4.cbs.state.or.us/ex/dir/omwesb/

The focus of the program has been outreach.  The small staff of three people work tirelessly to introduce the diverse business community to decision makers at the West Lafayette campus, in addition to staff from each of the three regional campuses: Purdue Calumet, Purdue North Central at Westfield, and Purdue University-Indiana University at Fort Wayne.  The cornerstone of the outreach efforts of the Purdue Supplier Diversity staff is the Relationship to Partnership (R2P) Sessions that take place each November.  R2P is structured to introduce the attending diverse businesses to decision makers from the Supplier Diversity Coalition of Greater Lafayette.  The Coalition members are the larger employers of Tippecanoe County, each committed to expanding opportunities to women and minority firms.

Additionally Purdue University participated in the Disparity Study that was commissioned by the State of Indiana.

This policy statement supports a long-range plan to enhance Stanford's external affirmative action.

c. Implementation

Vanderbilt University is committed to the principle of diversity and equal opportunity in all of its endeavors and applies this principle in its procurement activity with the objective of encouraging participation by qualified suppliers categorized as: small, disadvantaged, veteran, minority or women-owned enterprises. The university believes that strengthening and expanding its supplier base in these business classifications not only contribute to lowering our operational costs in providing education, research and patient care, but also improves the overall health of the greater business community within which we exist. It is a practice of the university to actively identify and solicit qualified small, disadvantaged, veteran, minority or women-owned businesses and to provide and promote equal opportunities for such suppliers within the university in order to promote supplier diversity.
In order to better meet the Supplier Diversity goals, Procurement Services coordinates the efforts of the university in the following ways:
1. Identifies the business classification of our suppliers at the time of their registration with Procurement Services.
2. Provides listings of small, disadvantaged, minority and women-owned businesses to the departments of the university.
3. Participates with local and regional minority purchasing organizations during seasonal opportunity fairs to not only share information regarding university projects, but also to identify potential new suppliers for participation in those projects.
4. Creates periodic reports to monitor the volume of business done with small, disadvantaged, veteran, minority and women-owned businesses and uses this information to assess and improve the effectiveness of our program.
5. Publishes information on Diversity Suppliers on the dedicated Diversity Program webpage VU Supplier Diversity Program
6. Coordinates and Sponsors an annual business diversity supplier fair.
7. Through these activities and the support of administrators throughout the university, Vanderbilt recognizes the economic and social benefits derived by promoting equal opportunity for the small, disadvantaged, veteran, minority or women-owned business community.
