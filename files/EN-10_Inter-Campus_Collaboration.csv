GW has also published its strategic plans on campus sustainability including the overarching GW Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy as well as the GW Climate Action Plan and GWater Plan. These plans are customized for GW's urban setting and access to Washington, D.C. These are available publicly so that other universities - especially those in urban settings - can use them as a blueprint for their own planning purposes as appropriate.

","GW collaborates with area campus partners on sustainability through a group called ""Metro DC Sustainability"" that includes representatives from American, Georgetown, University of the District of Columbia, George Mason, and Johns Hopkins, among others. GW has hosted meetings for the group. 

In addition, GW joined and helped to lead the charge on the DC Mayor's College and University Sustainability Pledge which was signed by all District-schools in February 2012. The District of Columbia Mayor’s College and University Sustainability Pledge (CUSP) invites the District’s institutions of higher education to commit to pursuing sustainability as engaged participants in the Mayor’s ambitious goal of making the District of Columbia the most sustainable city in America. The CUSP recognizes the critical leadership role of the District’s colleges and universities in advancing sustainability on campus and in the community.

In 2013 a city-wide Washington, D.C., collegiate team – Catholic University (CUA), George Washington University (GWU) and American University (AU) – competed as Team Capitol DC in the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon for the first time. Together, students and faculty mentors from the three universities harnessed the talents from each school’s premier programs (CUA’s School of Architecture and Planning; GWU’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Landscape Design Program and Interior Design Program; and AU’s School of Communication) to design, build and communicate about a sustainable home that produces as much energy as it uses. Team Capitol DC placed in the top ten in the Solar Decathlon.

Most recently, in 2014 GW partnered with American University and the George Washington University Hospital on a collaborative purchase for renewable energy providing the institutions with 50% of the their electricity needs through solar power for the next 20 years. This collaborative approach provides a model for other universities and large institutions to work together to demand, create, and purchase renewable energy at a large scale.  

In 2012, GW Sustainability faculty began to work together with colleagues at University College London to create a research and education network. In Fall 2013, faculty from UCL and GW held a virtual workshop to explore areas of research and teaching synergy.  Several areas were identified for future collaboration, include: urban planning and design, water, urban infrastructure, smart cities/big data, and STEM/public policy.  Some 25 GW and UCL faculty attended the workshop.  Dr. Julie Ryan (GW) and Dr. Sarah Bell (UCL) have since collaborated on a teaching project.  Each of their classes had enrollments of 30 students.  Drs. Ryan and Bell created ten teams of six students each (three each from the two institutions).  The project assignment was to develop a detailed systems engineering analysis of a given situation that include:  home gardens, community gardens, urban agriculture, home energy consumption, domestic water systems, etc.  In addition, Dr. Melissa Keeley (GW) and Dr. Sarah Bell (UCL) have begun collaborative research on comparing storm water plans for London, DC and Philadelphia.  The results of their research will be published soon. Our goals is to expand that network and to focus on the challenges capital cities face in implementing sustainability.

Over the past year (2015-2016), the Five College sustainability directors have initiated a number of collaborative projects. They are currently working on a collaborative approach to renewable energy purchasing, including innovative investment strategies and working to create a community climate fund to offset travel emissions.
In the context of this cooperative spirit, there is renewed interest in collaborating on innovative approaches to the regional food system. The Five Colleges have demonstrated a commitment to sourcing products locally, however, many dining service directors have identified the need for additional processing, including meat, dairy and vegetable options. Hampshire College is in the position to lead these collaborative efforts, given our new entrepreneurship program with a specific focus on food system innovation.
Feeding off of this renewed momentum, we will partner with the local organization CISA (Community Involved in Sustaining Agriculture), given their expertise in food system scaling, in order to build on their report, ""Scaling Up Local Food: Investing in Farm & Food Systems Infrastructure for the Pioneer Valley"". We plan to assess current system capacity for processing (particularly at the Franklin County CDC) as part of our evaluation. This work will be conducted in tandem with the exploration of a Five College Virtual Food Hub that will serve as an information-sharing center, connecting Five College dining service professionals with local farmers and food producers. Once we have identified particular opportunities and evaluated associated feasibly for the partnering institutions, we will create an implementation plan, working with regional agricultural leaders to identify opportunities for expanding agricultural infrastructure through targeted investment. Over the past two months, we have initiated conversations related to these goals with CISA and the dining directors and are currently reviewing a proposal for Phase I from CISA.


In 2012, The Five College Directors launched the Blue Sky Brainstorm to gather ideas from each institution regarding opportunities for collaboration on sustainability.   (The Five College consortium includes Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.) 

Students, staff, and faculty submitted ideas for improving sustainability at the Five Colleges. These ideas were compiled into a report available online here: https://www.fivecolleges.edu/sustain/blue_sky

Drawing from the ideas and energy that were generated by the Blue Sky Brainstorm sessions, the Blue Sky Steering committee generated a clear, concise set of sustainability frameworks, along with goals and specific projects that will advance the interests of the consortium.

(2) Greening the Campus Blog: 
Although last updated in 2012, the Greening the Campus Blog still offers insights and observations from the perspective of a campus sustainability professional for others entering the relatively new field on college campuses.  In doing so, the blog promotes discussion and knowledge sharing amongst those on the front lines of the campus sustainability movement.  The blog is hosted by Rice’s Director of Sustainability, Richard Johnson, and addresses all aspects of campus sustainability from operations and curriculum to student life. 

(3) Shell Center for Sustainability
The Shell Center for Sustainability works collaboratively with Rice’s faculty, staff and students to create an interdisciplinary program of research, outreach and education to address sustainable development to better the planet’s economy, society and environment.  One noteworthy aspect of the Shell Center for Sustainability is that it archives all of its reports, publications and presentations.  These archives are readily available to the public, thereby allowing other college campuses to remain informed and learn about the sustainability research, presentations and initiatives at Rice University.

","Stanford has multiple sustainability officers who sit on boards or committees related to sustainability in higher education. Fahmida Ahmed, Director of the Office of Sustainability, sits on both the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference Steering Committee (http://cahigheredusustainability.org/about/steeringcommittee.php) and the AASHE Board of Directors (http://www.aashe.org/about/governance/board). She is currently serving as chair of the board for calendar years 2015-16.

Rashmi Sahai, Assessments Program Manager in the Office of Sustainability, serves on the AASHE STARS Steering Committee. Moira Hafer, Sustainability Specialist in the Office of Sustainability, serves on the AASHE STARS “Air & Climate” Technical Advisory Committee. More information on the STARS governance committees can be found here: https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/governance.html. 

In 2015, Stanford led a joint effort between Ivy League schools, the University of California campuses, and a handful of other research institutions to provide recommendations on improvement to the STARS Steering Committee as the committee prepared for the release of STARS 2.1. (This occurred prior to Stanford staff serving on STARS committees.)

Stanford also founded and jointly leads the Menus of Change University Research Collaborative (MCURC), which is a network of 115 members representing 41 institutions: 24 member colleges and universities, 12 colleges and universities represented by academic faculty, and three ex officio organizations. Members include university-based faculty and staff as well as leaders from campus dining operations. The Collaborative consists of a diverse mix of perspectives as far as geographic location, size and type of institution (both private and public), fields of study, and types of dining operations. The purpose of MCURC is to create a culture of sharing and innovation within and among colleges and universities using the Menus of Change principles (which focus on sustainability and nutrition) in their campus dining operations, and to develop a research agenda related to those principles. MCURC aims to impact the university and college food system by forming a synergistic network of university-based scholars, administrators, food service business leaders, and executive chefs to explore critical food issues within university settings, as well as to share these research findings with colleagues. 

R&DE also leads the Bay Area Sustainable Sourcing Group, in conjunction with Google Food, a group that brings together food service leaders to learn from experts in the sustainable food field. 

Finally, Stanford also released a statement in October 2015 ahead of the COP 21 conference in Paris. The statement urges the global community convening at COP21 to look to universities for innovative climate solutions, highlighting its leadership in both academic and operational endeavors. Stanford also submitted a pledge along with many peer institutions to support the Climate Action Day organized by the White House and State Department on November 19, 2015. An article detailing the statement can be found here: http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/october/climate-change-statement-102815.html.

","ESF recently joined the New York State REV Campus Challenge which promotes clean energy efforts by recognizing and supporting colleges and universities in New York State that implement clean energy projects and principles on campus, in the classroom, and in surrounding communities. The REV Campus Challenge is part of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s Reforming the Energy Vision (REV), a strategy to build a clean, resilient, and affordable energy system for all New Yorkers. REV Campus Challenge recognizes achievements among institutions of higher education and enables exchange of best practices and lessons learned. REV Campus Challenge seeks to help colleges and universities meet their financial, environmental, academic, and community goals through clean energy solutions that also help scale up total clean energy use in New York State. 

Additionally, ESF is participating in the REV Energy to Lead Competition, Governor Cuomo’s $3 million clean energy competition for colleges and universities. The competition will challenge student-led coalitions across the State to develop creative ideas to aggressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions on school campuses and beyond. The three groups that propose the best ideas to invest in clean energy will each win $1 million to help implement their plans. 

The Sustainable Enterprise Partnership (SEP) is a transdisciplinary approach to sustainability. Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management and L.C. Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science, the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and the Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems form a unique collaboration providing world-class education and research on sustainable enterprise management. http://partnersforsustainability.org/

The Center for Environmental Policy and Administration (CEPA) is an interdisciplinary center within Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. CEPA explores environmental issues from an integrated perspective that considers technical, social, and humanistic aspects of environmental matters and prepares leaders who can blend those dimensions as they confront the world’s complex environmental challenges. CEPA members work with faculty at ESF.

","International Association for Research on Service-learning and Community Engagement

The International Association for Research on Service-Learning and Community Engagement (IARSLCE) is an international, non-profit organization devoted to promoting research and discussion about service-learning and community engagement. IARSLCE was launched in 2005, and incorporated in 2007. The mission of the IARSLCE is to promote the development and dissemination of research on service-learning and community engagement internationally and across all levels of the education system. Tulane University's Center for Public Service hosted the Eighth International Research Conference on Service-learning and Community Engagement in October 2008 and will assume the role of the association's administrative home in January of 2009 until December of 2015.
Memberships and Affiliations

Campus Compact

The mission of Campus Compact is to educate college students to become active citizens who are well-equipped to develop creative solutions to society's most pressing issues. Over the past 20 years, Campus Compact has engaged more than 20 million students in service and service-learning, and participation rates keep rising. Each year, students work in thousands of communities, both locally and globally, to provide desperately needed services, including tutoring at-risk youth in reading and math, building houses for low-income families, conducting environmental safety studies, and caring for the sick, the hungry, the homeless, and the elderly.


Clinton Global Initiative University

President Clinton established the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) in 2005 to turn ideas into action. A non-partisan initiative of the William J. Clinton Foundation, CGI moves beyond discussion, fostering a shared responsibility to address major global problems. From presidents to academics, from the boardroom to the classroom, CGI members from all walks of life are affecting positive change. In 2008, Tulane University hosted the inaugural meeting of the CGI University. This meeting brought together over 1000 students, faculty, and special guests from around the county.


Gulf South Summit on Service-Learning and Civic Engagement through Higher Education

The mission of the Gulf-South Summit and Civic Engagement through Higher Education is to promote networking among practitioners, engaged research, ethical practices, reciprocal campus-community partnerships, sustainable programs, and a culture of engagement and public awareness through service-learning and other forms of engagement. The 2009 conference was hosted by LSU in Baton Rouge, March 25th-27th. Tulane University hosted the 2004 and the 2007 conferences.

Greater New Orleans Imagining America Consortium

Imagining America is a national consortium of colleges and universities committed to public scholarship in the arts, humanities, and design. Public scholarship joins serious intellectual endeavor with a commitment to public practice and public consequence. It includes:

    Scholarly and creative work jointly planned and carried out by university and community partners;
    Intellectual work that produces a public good;
    Artistic, critical, and historical work that contributes to public debates;
    Efforts to expand the place of public scholarship in higher education itself, including the development of new programs and research on the successes of such efforts.  

Public scholarship in the arts and humanities integrates all the missions of higher education: research, teaching, service, and public engagement. Current projects include the Tenure Team Initiative on Public Scholarship , the Curriculum Project , and Publicly Active Graduate Education (PAGE ) .

Talloires Network

The Talloires Network is a collective of individuals and institutions committed to promoting the civic roles and social responsibilities of higher education. Talloires Network schools work together to catalyze dialogue, research, and action to implement the recommendations of the Talloires Declaration . “Our institutions recognize that we do not exist in isolation from society, nor from the communities in which we are located. Instead, we carry a unique obligation to listen, understand, and contribute to social transformation and development.” The Talloires Network fosters opportunities for mutual learning between institutions of higher education and communities, applies standards of excellence to community engagement work, seeks diversity both in our membership and in our approach to civic engagement, and works for international representation.

The Research University Civic Engagement Network (TRUCEN)

Recognizing research universities' potential to provide leadership on this issue, in the fall of 2005 Campus Compact and the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University convened scholars from some of the many research universities that have undertaken ambitious community efforts to discuss how their institutions are promoting engagement on their campuses and in their communities. In February 2008, the group convened at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill to focus on civic and community-engaged scholarship. The group formally organized itself as The Research University Civic Engagement Network (TRUCEN) and opened its membership to all Carnegie Foundation-defined ""very high research institutions"" that share its goals.


Posse Foundation
Tulane University has partnered with the Posse Foundation to establish a Posse chapter in New Orleans designed to increase the number of graduates of the city’s public high schools who enroll at Tulane. The partnership is made possible with the help of a $200,000 grant from the Edward G. Schlieder Educational Foundation.

Upward Bound/ TRIO: 
Upward Bound is a federally funded TRIO program that provides fundamental support to participants in their preparation for college entrance. The program provides opportunities for participants to succeed in pre-college performance and ultimately in higher education pursuits. The goal of Upward Bound is to increase the rates at which participants enroll in and graduate from institutions of post-secondary education.

","MLK Service Day: This day of service is usually the kick-off event of the Martin Luther King Jr. Week for Peace, a series of events sponsored annually to commemorate, celebrate, and reflect on the life and teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his vision of collective work and social justice. The Martin Luther King Jr. Week for Peace was established in 1987 and is a consortium initiative between Dillard, Loyola, Tulane, and Xavier universities. Each year, the consortium sponsors a week-long series of events surrounding MLK Day in January, including an interfaith service, a convocation featuring a guest speaker, student and community forums, tributes to students and outstanding community leaders, collaborative community service projects, a candlelight march, and unity celebration; http://www.mlkweek4peace.org

Tulane University’s Young African Leaders Initiative The Washington Fellowship is the new flagship program of the President’s Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI). This program will bring over 500 young leaders to the United States each year, beginning in 2014, for leadership training, academic coursework, and mentoring, and will create unique opportunities in Africa to put those new skills to practical use in propelling economic growth and prosperity and strengthening democratic institutions. Tulane will host 25 young African Leaders in the Summer of 2014.

Focus on women’s leadership builds global connections. One of only five American universities chosen by the U.S. State Department for the Innovations in Civil Participation project, Tulane University is partnered with Fatima Jinnah Women University in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. During a June visit there with Tulane colleagues, Sally J. Kenney, executive director of the Newcomb College Institute, taught a master’s course in women’s leadership. “Newcomb shares a deep affinity with this university,” reports Kenney, who says the four Pakistani women’s universities, like Newcomb College at Tulane, originated out of familial concern for educating women and men together. “We have a lot in common and can benefit from working together,” Kenney says. Fatima Jinnah Women University wants to develop its faculty through postdoctoral and doctoral study, and the first faculty visitor to Tulane is expected in 2014. Kenney, with Tulane colleagues Beth Wee from the School of Science and Engineering and Agnieszka Nance from the Center for Public Service, also participated in a seminar on service learning for faculty, staff, and students, toured the campus, and visited an orphanage where FJWU students tutor girls. Kenney hopes to return to Pakistan soon to train faculty and students in case-study teaching and writing about women’s leadership. Future goals include the creation of a semester-long exchange program for students, as well as summer internships for Tulane students working with FJWU’s community partners.

We worked with an intern from Oxford University to compile a primer on promoting sustainable behavior that has proved to be a popular resource and a student from Cambridge University that produced a resource on storytelling for sustainability.

Berkeley regularly participates in conferences that support collaboration between higher education institutions including the annual AASHE conference and the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference.
","A few examples include:  AASHE, ACUPCC, Recyclemania, Campus Conservation Nationals, International Alliance of Research Universities (Sustainability Committee).","UC Berkeley participates in the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), which established a campus sustainability initiative in 2009 with the aim of promoting collaboration between member institutions and developing best practices strategies in environmental management. The initiative was formally launched at the Climate Congress at the University of Copenhagen in March 2009.The Presidents of the IARU have stated their ongoing commitment to sustainability. Each member of the alliance has established programs to progressively improve their environmental performances across university activities as well as building an ecologically literate community. The relevant staff from each university communicate on matters of common interest to identify opportunities to work together and exchange information.

Additionally, UC Berkeley engages with other UC campuses in a variety of sustainability programs and initiatives. In November 2013, President Janet Napolitano announced the Carbon Neutrality Initiative, which commits UC to emitting net zero greenhouse gases from its buildings and vehicle fleet by 2025, something no other major university system has done.

Our campus also is working with the other UC campuses on the Global Food Initiative, which involves all 10 UC campuses, UC’s Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the UC Office of the President. The initiative is a collaborative effort guided by a systemwide steering committee appointed by UC President Janet Napolitano and chancellors. This effort is supported by working group teams that include representatives from all 10 UC campuses. 

Berkeley also is involved with the Faculty Engagement and Education Working Group of the UC Global Climate Leadership Council, which develops broad faculty support and participation in UC’s 2025 carbon neutrality goal and to advance UC leadership in climate change and sustainability education. The group's goal is to make sustainability and climate neutrality part of the curricular and/or other educational experience of all UC students by 2020.

Lastly, Berkeley played an active role in the Cool Campus Challenge, an inter-campus competition in 2015 in which all 10 UC campuses competed to reduce emissions.

The UC Davis Climate Action Plan, a poster by Camille Kirk (UC Davis Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability)","UC Davis belongs to many organizations with environmental and sustainability-related missions. A few of these are: the Yolo County Climate Compact, the City of Davis Climate Action Team, Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, and The Climate Registry. UC Davis is also a member of the American College & University Presidents’ Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), a high-visibility effort to address global climate disruption undertaken by a network of colleges and universities that have made institutional commitments to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions from specified campus operations, and to promote the research and educational efforts of higher education to equip society to re-stabilize the earth’s climate. 

UC Davis is part of the Council of the California Student Sustainability Coalition (CSSC) – which is a network of students and colleges that are actively working to transform their educational institutions and communities into models of sustainability. The UC Davis chapter of the CSSC, also known as the CSSC, began in 2003. The first year fostered projects like the Education for Sustainable Living Program (ESLP) and the Sustainability Summit.

UC Davis is involved with colleges and universities throughout the state as part of the annual California Higher Education Conference. Staff have presented and served on committees responsible for various components of the conference.

UC Davis staff actively participate in the GRNSCH-L and RECYC-L mail lists about sustainability topics and recycling and waste reduction programs at college and university campuses as well as related topics of interest to persons responsible for planning and implementing such programs.

UC Davis is a member of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) and have staff that participate in the USGBC Northern California chapter.
","UC Davis works closely with the other 9 campuses in the UC System. The Assistant Director of Sustainability co-chairs the systemwide Climate Change Working Group. Staff members participate in multiple monthly conference calls with others to share best practices. Some of the monthly call groups are the UCOP Green Building Working Group, the UCOP LEEB EB Working Group, the UCOP Climate Change Working Group, the Sustainability in Academics Task Force, the Socially Responsible Investing Task Force, and the UC Sustainability Officer’s Working Group. UC Davis is also involved in development of the systemwide Sustainable Practices Policy 

UC Davis participates on the steering committee for the annual California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, which is being hosted by UC Davis in June 2012, and is a conference dedicated to bringing together all four systems of higher education in California to share information about best practices and programs, and forge new collaborations.

For labs and other research space, the UC Davis sustainability manager conceived of the Freezer Challenge, a national contest pitting UC Davis against other universities in a race to save energy and improve sample management. The Freezer Challenge is a way to introduce a variety of laboratory cold storage techniques, ranging from cleaning out and defrosting freezers to creating inventories of frozen samples to adjusting freezer temperatures and retiring old, less efficient freezers. 

UC Davis collaborated with other universities to develop its Green Labs practices and program. It shares information with others through a Green Labs listserv that was co-founded with UCSB, CU-Boulder, and Harvard University. UC Davis also collaborated with the DOE Better Building Association in designing fume hood closure campaigns and cold storage management. In 2013 UC Davis worked closely with the International Institute for Sustainable Laboratories (I2SL), about 10 campuses, NIH, and several consultants to describe “continuous improvement” metrics for green labs initiatives on large campuses. UC Davis works UC system-wide on procurement strategies for laboratory equipment and supplies while also sharing methods for one of our newer material stream recycling projects - foam packaging and coolers.

UC Davis has presented repeatedly on sustainability practices and programs at the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education Conference, Laboratories for the 21st Century (Labs21®) Conference, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, Western Association of College & University Housing Officers (WACUHO) Conference, the national Association of College & University Housing Officers, among others
In 2010, the Sustainable Textiles and Medical Protection (STAMP) Conference was hosted by a team of researchers from University of California, Davis, University of California, Berkeley, North Carolina State University, and Donghua University (Shanghai, China) on the UC Davis campus.

"University of California, Irvine",2016-03-23,2016-03-23 10:32:33,khaq@uci.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"UC Irvine actively seeks opportunities to share information about its award-winning sustainability practices in the area of energy efficiency, green building, transportation, food services, and waste minimization. Campus representatives make dozens of presentations at conferences and symposia throughout the year; many of these events attracting audiences not only from higher education but also from  government and the private sector. Most of the presentations are posted online for conference attendees. UC Irvine readily shares information on its websites, provides copies of papers and presentations, and has hosted other campuses for sustainability-oriented tours and briefings.

SMART LABS INITIATIVE
UC Irvine gets frequent requests to share information about its Smart Labs Initiative, a proven, comprehensive energy-savings program that involves re-engineering building control systems in already-energy-efficient laboratory buildings from bottom to top to safely reduce energy consumption by an average of 60 percent. The program is the cornerstone of UC Irvine’s partnership in the Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Challenge, and a key focus of that program is the sharing of best practices. In calendar years 2012-2015, UCI staff participated in more than two dozen outreach activities ranging from providing half-day Smart Labs seminars to speaking at national and international conferences, as well as hosting various universities at UCI to discuss energy management and green building practices.

On March 1, 2016, UCI hosted an Energy Management Workshop that attracted participants from the following institutions: Arizona State University, Carleton College, Georgia Institute of Technology, Slippery Rock University, Southwestern Illinois College, University of Alberta, UCLA, UC Riverside, and USC.

Wendell Brase, UCI's Vice Chancellor for Administrative & Business Services, is frequently invited to speak about UCI's energy savings program and recently was an invited keynote at the University of Hawai'i's 4th Annual Sustainability Summit and the 2016 Microgrid Global Summit, one of two pillars in the ICEPAG (International Colloquium on Environmentally Preferred Advanced Generation) smart, clean-energy colloquium series presented by the Advanced Power and Energy Program at UCI.

Presenters:Katie Maynard, UC Santa Barbara; Bob Koester, Ball State University; Bill Brown, Indiana University; Aurora Winslade, UC Santa Cruz; Renee Lafrenz, Alliance to Save Energy (moderator)
Description: Training emerging professionals about sustainability concepts needs to happen both in and out of the classroom in order to meet ambitious national workforce education and training goals.  The process of approving college and university courses can take time, which delays a campus' ability to meet student and workforce demands.  But, in the meantime, dedicated faculty and curriculum developers (e.g., sustainability directors and facilities managers who also teach) are developing best practices for infusing sustainability concepts into existing multi-disciplinary courses.  These courses can range from those in the environmental science department to business, teaching, and engineering.  

Leveraging the experiences of an expert panel from campuses nation-wide, this session will examine different techniques for academic infusion and course integration-- focusing specifically on energy efficiency.  It will also provide a forum for curricula developers to meet one another to discuss the challenges they've encountered and lessons learned.

( http://www.seagrant.uconn.edu/ ) Our mission is to work towards achieving healthy coastal and marine ecosystems and consequent public benefits by supporting integrated locally and nationally relevant research, outreach and education programs in partnership with stakeholders. The University also partners with the National Cooperative Extension Agencies, the USDA, the NSF, and other national agencies to promote research and extension in sustainability related topics. Much fieldwork is performed as collaboration with other partners, for example, partnerships with the Yale Forest or Audubon Society holdings. The GLISEN efforts for Long Island Sound study also fall into this category: """"The University of Connecticut and Stony Brook University (part of SUNY system) are exploring the formation of a research consortium to understand the full range of environmental interactions that transpire in the Sound, its coastal margins, and associated watersheds. The intent is to be highly inclusive of patterns and processes in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine compartments, including atmospheric, biological, and hydrological dynamics. As a result, research could encompass population and community studies of wildlife and fishery species; biogeochemical dynamics of urbanizing watersheds; plant-animal microbe interactions in terrestrial or aquatic systems; multi-jurisdictional conflicts and climate change adaptation; salt marsh restoration, aquaculture; infectious disease dynamics; landscape ecology of litter invertebrates; efficacy of N-credit policies; fate, transport, and effects of pharmaceuticals; regional circulation models, urban forestry; air pollution and human health; food web dynamics; atmosphere-biosphere interactions"""" The University of Connecticut is also a member of AASHE (The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education) an international organization with the aim to advance sustainability in higher education. In order to create leaders in sustainability, AASHE provides institutions with resources to incorporate sustainability in every aspect of their university from governance and operations to education and research. Additionally UConn is a member of the ACUPCC (American College & University President’s Climate Commitment), a national organization that holds American colleges and universities to a variety of commitments in order to further the sustainability of their campuses. These commitments include the completion of an emissions inventory, setting a target date for becoming carbon neutral, following short term actions that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, integrating sustainability into the curriculum, and making this action plan and any progress publicly available.

Additionally, UConn is a partner institution with programs like the Department of Energy's Workplace Charging Challenge. 

 Finally, the OEP Director, Rich Miller is on the Steering Committee of the Northeast Campus Sustainability Consortium, and is a frequent speaker at NECSC conferences and programs. He organized the professional development section of last year’s annual conference. He also serves on the external advisory board to Penn State’s Sustainability Institute and, last year, was invited to, and presented about Climate Action Planning and sustainability at, a cabinet-level meeting of Western CT State University and at an Environmental Law guest lecture about sustainability at Quinnipiac Law School.","Examples include collaborations with the UConn Law School for sustainable curriculum development, inclusion of West Hartford representatives at Recycling Workgroup meetings, presenting and advising at regional campus “green team” meetings, collaboration with EcoHusky student groups in Avery point, conducting three regional campus Environmental Complioance Team meetings per year, which include topics like recycling and energy and water conservation, and regional campus pick-ups and collaboration in the annual sneaker recycling campaign.
