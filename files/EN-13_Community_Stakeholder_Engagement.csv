American University's main vehicle for stakeholder engagement is its Community Liaison Committee (CLC).  The CLC was established to foster positive relations and to maintain regular communication between the university and its neighbors and is made up of individuals from neighboring community organizations and representatives from the university. Meetings are held on a quarterly basis and include updates on active construction projects, university initiatives, and other matters of interest to the community. 

In addition, AU has a full time Community Relations Director who works closely with neighborhood leaders and organizations on issues directly related to the impact of the university on the residential neighborhood. The Director also works to bring community members on to campus to take advantage of what the university has to offer. The Director regularly attends meetings of the local Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) as other local civic associations.","American University is inclusive in its community engagement practices and opens up all meetings, events, and activities to any one who is interested. Information is shared far and wide in an effort to inform as many people as possible about the opportunities for engagement.","Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3E, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3F, Spring Valley/Wesley Heights Citizens Association, Neighbors for a Livable Community, Westover Place Homeowners Association, Embassy Park Homeowners Association, Fort Gaines Citizens Association, Tenleytown Historical Society, Tenleytown Main Streets, Van Ness Main Streets, Tenley Campus Neighbors Association, Tenleytown Neighborhood Association, Ward 3 Vision, Government of the District of Columbia (multiple agencies, Executive Office of the Mayor, Council of the District of Columbia), Mann Elementary School, Janney Elementary School, Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church","CLC meetings: attendance continues to grow as more people understand the benefit of the on-going dialogue between neighbors and the university.
Community events: regular community events (D.C. Mayoral debates, outdoor movies, AU arboretum tours, and others) bring neighbors on to campus and show them first hand the benefit of living near the university.
Community audit program: Neighbors age 60 and older who live near the university are able to audit any class at AU for only $100. This program makes lifelong learning possible for many in the neighborhood.
Construction update meetings: Over the course of any university construction project, community stakeholders are kept up to date through regular meetings and other communications which details how the project may impact the neighborhood. ",http://www.american.edu/communityrelations/,--
Appalachian State University,2016-02-01,2016-02-01 13:37:34,balllf@appstate.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Historic Prospective:
Since the original North Carolina Constitution’s call for the University [of North Carolina System] to deliver “useful” learning, UNC has worked to engage with the state’s business, government and nonprofit communities to ensure that it meets their needs and serves the people of North Carolina. When the University system was reconfigured in 1971, a commitment to “public service” was incorporated in the enabling legislation: the mission of the redefined University would be “accomplished in part through public service, which contributes to the solution of societal problems and enriches the quality of life in the state”.

Current Prospective:
The 2013-2018 Strategic Direction document for the University of North Carolina System entitled “Our Time, Our Future” has identified stakeholder engagement as a key strategy for the completion of Goal 3; Serving the people of North Carolina (see: Strategy C, page 60).
http://www.northcarolina.edu/sites/default/files/strategic_directions_2013-2018_0.pdf
UNC General Administration has asked each campus to develop a strategic plan for engagement and public service and to explore ways that encourage more engaged scholarship and research.
Appalachian State University’s strategic plan titled, The Appalachian Experience: Envisioning a just and sustainable future, provides direction for the campus over the course of the next five years. The plan serves as a recognition that the primary focus of the campus is to transform the lives of our students. We believe that this transformational Appalachian Experience results in engaged citizens who understand their responsibility to society. The plan contains six strategic directions. The third, entitled Engaging the State, Region, and World, has as one of its five stated initiatives, a pledge to engage external stakeholders through enhanced communication and deeper relationships.
Further, Appalachian State reports UNC community and economic engagement metrics to the UNC Engagement Council and to the Vice President, UNC General Administration
International, Community and Economic Engagement. This annual report highlights and quantifies Appalachian State's community engagement throughout the year and the community.

Arizona State University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 15:08:44,corey.hawkey@asu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Members of the Arizona Board of Regents are appointed by the Governor to represent all of the stakeholder groups in Arizona.  The Board operates in complete transparency.  Agenda and minutes are publicly posted, and the meetings are streamed over the web in real time.  Videos of past meetings are posted on the web.  The Board invites comments from the public at the start of every meeting.
Arizona State University was formed by a vote of Arizona residents.  As such, we have a commitment to serve these residents.  One of our goals is:
Enhance our local impact and social embeddedness 
•	Enhance linkage to local and regional social and community development groups 
•	Establish/develop/enhance linkages and partnerships with local, regional and national NGO’s, governments and public agencies, and private sector firms with a focus on community development 
•	Undertake applied sustainability research that impacts the social, environmental and economic evolution of the southwest 
•	Provide an objective and ongoing facilitation role for the region's progress 
","Far from being an “ivory tower,” in the last 10 years Arizona State University has made deep community involvement a key part of its identity. The university goes beyond typical outreach activities to establish significant ongoing partnerships with cities, towns, school districts and organizations across Arizona and the world. 
The desire to serve is fostered in ASU students. During 2013 about 14,000 Sun Devils participated in community service activities, performing more than 400,000 hours of service. More meaningfully, ASU students and faculty run three nurse-managed health clinics, work with entrepreneurs to start businesses, provide training for classroom teachers, mentor low-income parents, report regional news, develop sustainability solutions and provide testing for solar energy equipment and other devices. 
The ASU-Mayo Clinic partnership is perhaps the university’s most transformative. The two organizations initiated their successful collaboration in 2003. Since then, ASU and Mayo Clinic have formed a joint nursing education program; joint faculty appointments; dual degree programs; and collaborative research projects in cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, cellular and molecular biomedicine, vaccine development, genetics and sensory motor coordination. In 2011, the partnership deepened when ASU relocated its biomedical informatics department to Mayo’s Scottsdale campus. Last fall, Mayo announced that all students at that campus would complete a specialized master’s degree in the science of health care delivery granted by ASU, believed to be the first such program offered by a medical school. 
ASU also has taken up the gauntlet globally, developing research and educational partnerships in countries ranging from China to Mexico, from Ireland to Vietnam. Just as global cultures and societies are increasingly intertwined, so too are the economies of the world. Engaging with other countries is critical to the advancement of ASU as well as metropolitan Phoenix and the rest of the state. These linkages draw on ASU’s interdisciplinary strengths to amplify the results of research into climate change, health, water usage, renewable energy and K-12 education. 
Locally and globally, these efforts are fundamental to the higher mission of ASU, which is to transform society. 
“ASU has laid out the idea of the university as being one of the prime drivers in changing the world,” said Stephen Feinson, assistant vice president for global engagement. “There’s no option not to be engaged both locally and globally. We are all interconnected.” 
The university, however, does not just transform society. Society transforms the university. Students benefit by seeing the larger picture of what they are learning, and they gain greater mobility in study abroad opportunities, internships and careers. In 2010-11 academic year, 1,574 students studied abroad, an increase of almost 14 percent from the previous year. Hundreds more worked on international projects, increasing their cultural awareness and their preparation for success in the 21st century. 
ASU ranks 19th among all large universities for the number of graduates who volunteer and are accepted into the Peace Corps, and is one of the top schools nationwide for winning student Fulbright awards for study abroad. 
One of ASU’s most successful transformative projects is GlobalResolve, a program in which ASU students and faculty design affordable, low maintenance solutions to health and environmental needs in under-developed communities. About 300 ASU students in engineering, business, design, sustainability, architecture and other majors have participated in the four-semester GlobalResolve courses in the College of Technology and Innovation, many of them traveling overseas to work with local residents in developing nations. 
The ASU faculty also gains by working collaboratively with scientists and peers around the world, participating on research teams, seeking to solve common challenges. ASU has particularly strong ties with Sichuan University in China and with Technologico de Monterrey in Mexico, offering joint programs that include engineering and business. 
Open for business in Shanghai
More than 700 Chinese executives have earned MBAs from the W. P. Carey School of Business Executive MBA program in Shanghai, launched in 2003 under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Finance. This partnership is invaluable as China has the second largest economy in the world, and its people are a rich source of talent and innovation. 
ASU has received numerous national honors for its commitment to the community. The university has been named to the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll every year since 2008, and in 2010, it was one of only 10 schools invited to join the Changemaker Campus Consortium by Ashoka, a global nonprofit network of social entrepreneurs.

1. The Muncie Action Plan (MAP).  MAP was developed through an open process representing all community demographics and includes long-term goals and measurable action steps which upload the values identified by our community 
2. VISION 2016 Initiative - the community's 5-year economic development plan.","Many university faculty and staff are active throughout Indiana in local community, county and statewide governance structures and groups.  Meetings of these bodies involve sharing perspectives about the university's outreach and engagement efforts.  Feedback is routinely shared with department chairs, colleagues and Building Better Communities staff members. 

The university maintains strong relationships with key ""aggregator"" organizations throughout Indiana.  These organizations are typically statewide in scope and serve and advocacy mission for a particular sector or sub-sector of the economy.  In many cases, the university is represented on the boards of these organizations, serves in an advisory capacity, or provides a service.  Examples include TechPoint, the agreegator for the Information Technology sector; Conexus, the advocacy organization for the logistics industry; and the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns, the aggregator for municipal governmental jurisdictions.  The university is particularly interested in working with aggregators because of their influence within the entire sector.  These organizations are influential throughout the state and their leaders are key communicators and thought leaders.","The Associate Vice President of Economic Development and Community Engagement has been active in several organizations, including the Board of Directors of the Muncie Downtown Development Partnership, the Economic Development Board of the Muncie/Delaware County Chamber of Commerce, East Central Indiana Regional Partnership, and the Muncie Redevelopment Commission.  In addition, the AVPECDCE authored the ""Building Better Neighborhoods"" proposal that was funded by the Ball Brothers Foundation for $200,000. over three years.  

Building Better Neighborhoods serves as a resource to the Muncie community and develops processes to streamline access to Ball State resources, particularly those needed to foster strong neighborhood associations, which represent the critical infrastructure for pursuing and addressing additional projects of the Muncie Action Plan and VISION 2016 Initiative.

","Vision 2016 Commitment - In 2011 Ball State University pledged $250,000.00 in in-kind services toward the Muncie/Delaware County Vision 2016 Initiative.  To date, we have completed a variety of projects and have officially booked $218,672.00 toward that goal.

Cintas Initiative - The university in partnership with the City of Muncie and others are working together on a major community development project which involves repurposing a large (85,000+ gross square feet) vacant industrial building which sits adjacent to the core downtown district.  Early plans call for the creation of a ""Maker's Space"" for entrepreneurship, innovation, creativity and development.  The university views this public-private partnership as a great opportunity to support its community engagement commitment and elevate participation in Muncie.

Carnegie Community Engagement Classification - In January 2015, Ball State University was awarded the Community Engaged Classification from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.  The designation caps a two-year process that involved representatives from all seven colleges and included self-study.  The classification created in 2006, recognizes colleges and universities that demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to public service, civic involvement and community partnership.",http://www.bsu.edu/bbc,--

Boston University,2016-03-03,2016-03-03 13:42:17,carlberg@bu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Today, The Princeton Review ranks Boston University among the top-20 most tolerant universities in the nation, and among the most diverse. The tens of thousands of students who apply each year cite Boston University’s diversity as one of its most compelling features, fostered in large part by the University’s geography, which allows for a dynamic connection with the city and the world beyond. This tradition of practical engagement with the community at large is reflected in both the University’s operations and in its curriculum. Students are enmeshed in the affairs of the community, not just by their presence in the city, but also through the substantial resources and programs devoted to community service. As President Lemuel Murlin said more than a century ago, Boston University is “in the heart of the city, in the service of the city.” 
In 2007, the Trustees of Boston University approved a strategic plan initiated by current president, Robert A. Brown, to address the challenges and opportunities of the coming decade. 
All parts of the University community came together to identify issues central to strengthening programs and services in key areas. The strategic plan, called Choosing to be Great, articulates that the intellectual and cultural resources of Boston are important elements in the University’s strength. The plan also emphasizes that upgrading the physical infrastructure of the campus is essential, not only for enhancing the University’s reputation, but also for remaining operationally coordinated and retaining the best faculty and students. 
The development of a master plan for an institution as large and influential as Boston University is a major undertaking. The University has coordinated a process internally across various departments and externally across various city agencies, elected officials, and citizens.
In 1984, Boston University became the first institution in Boston to establish a community task force representing an array of neighboring organizations, associations, and institutions to advise the University and the City on the implementation of an institutional master plan. The Boston University Community Task Force has since also been used as a public forum to discuss community issues. 
The University, in cooperation with the task force representatives and city agencies, was the first institution in Boston to develop a master plan approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in 1986. The master plan analyzed the University’s needs – housing, enrollment, parking, academics, and recreation – and studied potential sites to accommodate the University’s changing needs. 
Two subsequent master plans were submitted and approved in 1997 and 2003, each promoting further transparency and strengthening the public process through multiple meetings of the BU Community Task Force and comment from the City of Boston.
The Boston University 2013-2023 Institutional Master Plan, approved by the BRA in January 2013, builds upon the success of earlier institutional master plans and the valuable assistance of the BU Community Task Force and City of Boston in crafting a future development framework for the campus. Seven proposed institutional projects will be coupled with public realm improvements to create a safer and more pedestrian-oriented campus. In total, these projects are expected to cost over $750 million and will support thousands of construction jobs over the next decade, in addition to providing additional permanent positions.
Boston University looks forward to working with the city and community as proposed institutional projects take shape and progress through the public review and approval process over the coming decade.","The University works extensively with the Boston University Community Task Force a mayor- appointed advisory group, which represents an array of neighboring organizations, associations, and institutions.  In addition to working with the Task Force, the Government and Community Affairs office works extensively with numerous civic associations and local non-profits.  Staff from the Government and Community Affairs office sit on an area non-profit and civic board and regularly attend community meetings within our surrounding neighborhoods.  Maintaining this level of involvement in the community allows the office to identify and respond to community needs as they arise. 
 BU sponsors many community initiatives, including the opening of a fitness center aimed at targeting childhood obesity in Boston’s South End and Lower Roxbury neighborhoods, and an annual holiday reading program, which serves approximately 1000 Boston Public Schools students annually . The University also distributes free tickets to BU athletic and cultural events and contributes generously to a range of local charities.","•	A Better City

- Boston University Health, Fitness, and Wellness Pilot Program (“BU Fitwell”): In 2013, Boston University, in conjunction with the Boston Public Health Commission and Boston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF), opened a unique health, fitness and wellness center to help combat teenage obesity in the City of Boston. BU FitWell provides access to free and low-cost physical activities and healthy living resources. Boston University renovated the facility space, located in the BCYF Blackstone Community Center, which was chosen for its potential to maximize outreach to at- risk youth and families, as well as for its proximity to additional health resources available at the Boston University Medical Center, the South End Health Center, and other neighboring community-based agencies. The renovated personal training space, 25 state-of-the-art exercise machines, and program administration account for a more than $900,000 of BU investment in the fitness center. 
Community Center members have access to quality fitness training, nutritional counseling, and wellness programming that is directed and guided by experts from Boston University. University staff strive to provide youths and families with the skills needed to make physical exercise and healthy choices an enduring part of their lifestyles. http://www.bu.edu/fitrec/facilities/blackstone.shtml

- Boston Scholars Program: Boston University’s Thomas M. Menino Scholarship Program is the longest running and largest scholarship program of its kind. Since 1973, the Menino Scholarship Program has helped secure higher education for students from the City of Boston. Each year, up to 25 Boston public high school seniors are awarded a four-year, full-tuition scholarship to Boston University. Since the program’s inception, Boston University has awarded approximately $186 million in scholarship funding to nearly 2,000 local students. 

In 2010, Boston University expanded the scholarship opportunities for Boston Public Schools high school students by creating a Community Service Award. Together, the Menino Scholarship Program and the Community Service Award create the University’s Boston Scholars Program. Through the Community Service Award, Boston University meets, without loans, the full calculated financial eligibility of any admitted Boston Public Schools high school graduate. Since the program’s inception in 2009, nearly 600 Boston Public Schools students have received over $18.8 million through the Community Service Award program.

The students who receive these awards represent the diverse population of the University’s host city, and many Boston Scholars are the first in their families to attend college. 

- Approval of the Boston University Charles River Campus 2013-2023 Institutional Master Plan: In 2013, after 18 months of preparation, review, more than a dozen public meetings, and with the support of the University’s Community Task Force, the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the Mayor of Boston unanimously approved the University’s institutional master plan, which outlines the University’s growth and campus development plans for the next 10 years.

- Bike Safety Pilot Program: In the spring of 2013, Boston University partnered with the City of Boston to pilot a new bike safety program along a stretch of Commonwealth Avenue, a heavily traveled thoroughfare which bisects the University’s Charles River Campus. In an effort to further protect cyclists and pedestrians, encourage bike use, and promote awareness of cyclists and pedestrians among motor-vehicle drivers, the safety initiative included new signage, enhanced bike-lane markings, and highway reflectors in the pavement. Later in 2013, Boston University unveiled its new Bike Safety website, http://www.bu.edu/bikesafety/, which includes a variety of bike safety videos, bike education materials, and links to additional bike resources. The University also developed a Bike Accident Toolkit app to assist with accident reporting. Both resources are available to the general public. http://www.bu.edu/bikesafety/

- Summer Youth Athletic Camp Scholarships: In 2012, as part of a continued effort to support the City of Boston’s initiative to increase youth access to free and low-cost physical activities, Boston University pledged to donate 100 summer athletic camp scholarships to City of Boston youth for the next five years. Camps are run by the Boston University athletic department and athletic coaches, and are dedicated to training youth in the skills needed to compete in basketball, hockey, wrestling, softball, lacrosse, rowing, and sailing.

- Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC): The Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) is a data center dedicated to research computing, which represents a ground-breaking collaboration of five of Massachusetts’ most research-intensive universities, state government, and private industry -- the most significant collaboration among government, industry, and public and private universities in the history of the Commonwealth, and the first facility of its kind in the nation. Boston University committed $10 million to the MGHPCC facility, which opened in 2011 in Holyoke, MA. The MGHPCC serves the growing research computing needs of the five founding universities as well as other research institutions, and serves as a critical piece of infrastructure which will allow the Commonwealth to attract and retain the very best young scientists, secure federal and private funding to support scientific research in the state, and continue to fuel the state’s innovation economy. http://www.mghpcc.org/

- Madison Park Housing Energy Efficiency Research Project: In 2013, BU’s Sustainable Neighborhood Laboratory (SNL), an innovative sustainability community engagement initiative, engaged youth in the Madison Park Village community in Roxbury, MA to understand behavior patterns related to energy consumption.  Five Boston high school youth were hired to work with the team of BU faculty and staff investigators. The students were trained in concepts of energy efficiency and helped conduct on-site research and data analysis support, affording the students the opportunity to gain an awareness about energy efficiency and research skills. With the information gathered with the help of local youth and residents, the project investigators will seek to develop engineering and econometric analyses of residents’ behavior and energy consumption. http://www.bu.edu/energy/aug20mpdc/",http://www.bu.edu/community/,"Additional examples of Boston University’s extensive community programming can be found in Chapter 11 and Appendix A of the University’s institutional master plan, which can be viewed at http://www.bu.edu/community/masterplans/institutional-master-plan/.

Calvin College,2016-03-11,2016-03-11 14:31:27,bhaney@calvin.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Calvin has several mechanisms for systematic assessment of community perceptions of the institutional engagement with community. Most of these assessments are currently program-based. For example, the Office of Community Engagement, situated within the Office of the Provost, enlisted a number of community partners in the development of its strategic plan. Similarly, the Service-Learning Center regularly conducts interviews with community stakeholders to better align our practices with community needs.

We received the Carnegie Classification for Community Engagment in 2010 after completing their rigorous application process. 

Our executive leadership explicitly promotes community engagement as a priority. Part of the 2019 Calvin Strategic Plan is to develop a systematic tracking and documentation of campus-wide community engagement activities. 

The community’s voice is integrated into institutional or departmental planning for community engagement in several key departments such as nursing, social work, and biology. When community members share in department decision making, it is often done through community advisory boards.","We have well established partners that were developed over time through mutual personal and professional connections. New partnerships have arisen as community partners have reached out to Calvin and when students have initiated the connection. 

One of the ways Community Partners reach out to Calvin using the following website:
http://calvin.edu/slc/opportunities/

One other way to engage new, or deepen existing relationships with, community stakeholders is by requiring the Service-Learning Center Staff to complete 30 site visits (collectively) annually.","The Service-Learning Center maintains a historical list of over 900 partners, categorized by level of commitment. We have attempted to deepen our commitment to a smaller number of these partners (approximately 30 organizations) over the past 5 years. Some of the exceptionally strong partnerships include:

serves as the liaison for the campus community to increase the awareness of the university’s 
involvement and positive impact in the community. The office convenes regular meetings with local public officials, as well as, with other community stakeholders in the areas of education, health, faith-based, community development corporations and residents. These meetings often include senior leadership, along with other university representatives to enable the university to obtain counsel. The office also convenes quarterly meetings with internal campus stakeholders to identify areas of synergy and foster opportunities for program collaboration. In addition, the quarterly meetings contribute toward the development of university-wide civic engagement policies/initiatives.

The Office for Inclusion, Diversity and Equal Opportunity also convenes community 
stakeholders who are participants of the Supplier Diversity Initiatives Council (SDIC). The 
Council was created in 2002 and designed to assist minority and women-owned business 
enterprises to gain greater access to business opportunities at the University. The quarterly 
meetings are led and facilitated by the university’s vice president for diversity and inclusion who reports the university’s spend with minority/women owned businesses, as well as, upcoming opportunities for MBE/FBE’s to conduct business with the university.","There are a number of methods the university identifies and engages community stakeholders, as well as, underrepresented groups. The Office for Local Government and Community Relations conducts and annual campus survey to quantify and qualify the university’s core areas of community engagement. The information obtained reflects the university coordinates more than 750 outreach programs annually with over 1,000 community partners locally, regionally, nationally and globally. Out of the 1,000 partners, the survey shows the majority of the university’s resources and services are invested with the Cleveland Metropolitan School District – the largest school district in the NE Ohio region. With a graduation rate of 56%, CWRU invests approximately $11 million in programs, services and in-kind resources to ensure the students, teachers and staff are academically prepared to succeed in pre and post-secondary education. Although the university also works with communities of all demographics, the community inventory shows our primary areas of engagement are with the underserved populations where high levels of disparity exist in the areas of education, health, economic and community development. Such disparities are in the immediate neighborhoods surrounding the university’s campus borders: Glenville, Fairfax, Hough, Little Italy and adjacent inner ring suburb East Cleveland – nationally recognized and one of the poorest cities in the nation. CWRU faculty, staff and students have developed numerous programs and initiatives in each of the core areas identified to help address and eradicate the disparities experienced by these communities.","Find a map of community stakeholders here: http://www.case.edu/pubaff/govrel/

In 2007, our faculty, staff and students invested over 172,000 of volunteer service in the Greater Cleveland community compared to over 750,000 in 2014. This is an economic value of nearly $16 million. In addition, we have seen our community partners double from 500 in 2007 to more than 1000 in 2014. This increase in service is a reflection of the university’s commitment to serving the needs of the community.",http://www.case.edu/pubaff/govrel/communityrelations/,--

Chatham University holds monthly meetings with neighborhood associations at both our Shadyside and Eden Hall campuses. Community planning is incorporated into our capital design projects when they occur. Chatham voluntarily meets each month with the Pine Richland Township business manager to keep the township informed and able to participate.  Chatham is also part of the Woodland Road Association, with one Chatham employee and two neighborhood members as managers.
","Chatham identifies community stakeholders through our interactions on issues and through research, educational programming, and outreach. ","Neighborhood associations: Pine Richland Township, Woodland Road Association

Government bodies: Zoning offices of the City of Pittsburgh and Pine Richland Township, Sustainability offices for Allegheny County and City of Pittsburgh
Civil Societies: Kingsley Association, Urban Redevelopment Authority, Group Against Smog and Pollution, Concerned Citizens Corporation of Larimer","Our outcomes include the efficient management of maintenance roads,the  restoration of historic lighting on Woodland Rd., and paying for water lines at our Eden Hall campus, which benefits the local community by avoiding the tap-in fee for the sewer line on Glasgow Road.  We approached the neighborhood association along Glasgow Road and offered to bear the cost for extending water and sewer lines on the road (people on the road had only private wells and septic systems) since it could be incorporated easily into our existing water and sewer projects.",--,--

In addition, it is the policy of Coastal Carolina University to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, sex or veteran's status in regard to the administration of all campus programs, services and activities including intercollegiate athletics, and the admission of students, employment actions, or other sponsored activities.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and certain other federal and state laws prohibit discrimination on these bases in education programs and activities operated by Coastal Carolina University. Coastal Carolina University complies with the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681, et seq., and subsequent regulations, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in all programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. Coastal Carolina University receives such assistance and complies with this law and its implementation of regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106 (http://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/reg/ocr/edlite-34cfr106.html).
To ensure compliance with Title IX, the President of the University has designated the Title IX Coordinator as the primary contact responsible for developing, adopting and/or assuring the dissemination of the University's nondiscrimination policy and for making the policy available to the University community. In addition, the Associate Athletics Director/Student-Athlete Enhancement and Senior Women's Administrator will make the policy available to student-athletes as required to be in full compliance with the NCAA. The Office of Human Resources and Equal Opportunity will make the policy available to faculty, staff, the University community and the public.  View the University’s Title IX Statement and Non-Discrimination Policy.
Inquiries concerning the application of these laws to programs and activities of Coastal Carolina University or any individual who believes he or she has been discriminated against in violation of the University's nondiscrimination policy, including sexual harassment or gender discrimination, or who has witnessed discrimination against another, may obtain information and assistance regarding the University's policies and responsive processes.

","The Office of Multicultural Student Services serves as a liaison for Coastal Carolina University and its underrepresented students. Its purpose is to enhance the academic, social and cultural development of multicultural students through counseling and programming. The collegiate experience is one that will challenge each individual's perspective. The programs offered through the Office of Multicultural Student Services are designed to be catalysts for student success.","Leadership Challenge - The Leadership Challenge program recognizes academic skills and leadership potential in minority students as a means of reinforcing their identity with the university; promotes the development of leadership potential through seminars, workshops, conferences and practical experience; and involves Coastal students in university and community service projects. 

SNAP - Students Navigating and Advising Peers - The university provides mentoring for first-year students through programs and activities. The goal of the SNAP program is to help new students adjust and successfully function within the university community by providing positive role models. Each student who participates in the program is paired with an upperclass student to help guide them through their first year at CCU. 

Women of Color - Designed to enhance communication, camaraderie and mentorship opportunities among women of color at Coastal Carolina University, Women of Color (WOC) consists of faculty, staff and students who meet bi-monthly to plan and implement events for the campus community.

AAIM - Designed to improve the academic and personal growth of men in the program, the African-American Initiative for Males (AAIM) seeks to increase the retention and matriculation of African-American males at Coastal Carolina University.

Most any major landscape or significant building exterior change affecting the physical campus requires city permits and sometimes formal submittal to City Planning as a development plan, or minor amendment to the campus master plan for review and approval.  For significant changes, as determined by City Planning there may be a required 30-day posting of the project on the campus perimeter asking for outside community comments to City Planning, which are considered in the review process before approval is granted or denied.  In some cases City Planning can require open neighborhood meetings with the college administration to discuss major proposed physical changes to the campus or to surrounding streets and traffic.  This formal process allows for the external community to have a voice in the physical changes happening on campus.  ","Colorado College has run a soup kitchen every Sunday since 1992. In the fall of 2014, the soup kitchen underwent a large restructuring process in order to better reach the community and more heavily involve the students. The Collaborative for Community Engagement held The Soup Project competition over the course of the 2014-2015 school year. This competition was open to students to submit ideas and models for the new community outreach program. The program has been restructured. The Collaborative for Community Engagement is working to create a model that addresses root causes of homelessness in Colorado Springs, more closely involves students with the community members, and offers support programs for those community members that may be struggling.

The Collaborative for Community Engagement works closely with community stakeholders on a variety of projects. The CCE seeks to streamline service delivery, facilitate sustainable community partnerships, and move continually towards best practices.  Towards these goals, the CCE strives for systematic program assessment and the nesting of programming in conceptual frameworks and research findings from across the disciplines.

2. Expand Collaborative Decision-Making
3. Improve Civic Pedagogy

It is made up of CSU students, CSU faculty/staff, and local community members who work together to increase transparency, accessibility, and engagement in CSU governance, strategy, and operations. 

The CPD serves as an impartial resource to the northern Colorado community. It is based on the belief that democracy requires high quality communication, but unfortunately such communication is rare. Working with students trained in small group facilitation, the CPD assists local government, schools boards, and community organizations by researching issues and developing useful background material, and then designs, facilitates, and reports on innovative public events. ","The Center for Public Deliberation conducts frequent Community Issues Forums where anyone can come to present issues of concern. These can then be adopted as formal topics for consideration and are considered by the various committee members in hope of finding supportive community solutions. Underrepresented and vulnerable groups benefit from this free resource as a way to give voice to concerns and ask for consideration on important items.

","A few successes from the past three years include:

Creation of the Northern Colorado Food Cluster: CPD Director Martín Carcasson began working with CSU extension in the fall of 2011 to provide trainings on deliberative practices. In November 2013, CPD worked with Routt County CSU Extension Agent Karen Massey to hold a forum on improving the local food economy. The forum brought together a collection of farmers, local government officials, restaurateurs, and consumers for a two-hour conversation. CPD’s work in local food issues expanded beyond CSU Extension in November 2013 and February 2014. CPD and the Northern Colorado Food Cluster held forums that brought together a mix of local farmers, food businesses, consumers, government officials, and nonprofits to discuss issues related to developing the local food economy. The Food Cluster seeks to create a healthy community through a resilient, local food system, while supporting and promoting local food production, distribution and consumption. Work with the Food Cluster will continue in the fall of 2014.

Creation of a ""Deliberation Track"" in the Communications Studies Masters Program: The program began in the fall of 2013. A new course in Deliberative Theory and Practice was taught for the first time in Spring 2014 to support the track. Graduate students at CSU can now be formally trained in deliberative practices to aid local communities.

Nature in the City Initiative: The City of Fort Collins is running a process to improve overall access to nature within the city. CPD ran an initial process in March 2014 that established these goals: (a) ensure every resident is within a 10-minute walk to nature, (b) have natural spaces that provide diverse social and ecological opportunities, and (c) continue to shift the landscape aesthetic from lawns to more diverse landscapes that support healthy environments for all species. CPD anticipates assisting with another process in fall 2014. Nature in the City website: http://www.fcgov.com/advanceplanning/natureinthecity/

Development of the Partnership for Age-Friendly Communities: This project was started in 2011 and received a national grant this year connected to the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging and MetLife.  Three major projects were run in 2013-2014 including a daylong workshop and two forums on age-friendly transportation.

Through Community Impact, approximately one thousand Columbia University student volunteers work every year with some 25 community service programs to serve more than 8,000 people in Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights. At the Double Discovery Center of Columbia College, our students, alumni, and faculty provide after school and summertime academic enrichment to prepare low-income and at-risk high school students for higher education. Columbia Community Service raises funds from faculty and staff  to support more than 50 local not-for-profit organizations, including soup kitchens, childcare centers, and community gardens in northern Manhattan.
Columbia University has a long tradition of civic engagement by its students, faculty, staff, and alumni, who provide numerous direct services to city residents through hundreds of local partnerships and programs and play leadership roles in public service and the professions, the arts, and the sciences. The Office of Government and Community Affairs (GCA) provides information on and access to the University for local residents, community and civic organizations and others. The Office works to establish and maintain community partnerships, in addition to addressing issues of interest and concern.
GCA is the University’s primary liaison to local Community Boards and represents the University on the boards of several other community organizations.  The office tracks and monitors the Manhattanville Campus Expansion Project, responding to community inquiries and providing the University with timely information on neighborhood issues. The Office also serves as the University’s primary link to the West Harlem Development Corporation and participates in the implementation of the historic West Harlem Community Benefits Agreement and related programs.

","For the academic year 2013-14, two Community Impact groups with over 80 volunteers, informed 1200 local residents about signing up for health insurance, food stamps and other social service benefits. The environmental group, Earth Coalition organized 4 workshops during Earth Week, on Recycling, Energy, Food and Water, reaching about 200 individuals.

In February 2015, community stakeholder engagement at Cornell is generally routed through the Office of Sustainability (Facilities), the Office of Community Relations (Administration), the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (Academic), and Cornell Cooperative Extension and Public Service Center (land grant mission) who consult on a regular basis. To enhance these efforts, change is in the offing. 

Engaged Cornell – a groundbreaking, $150 million, 10-year initiative to establish community engagement and real-world learning experiences as the hallmark of the Cornell undergraduate experience – was launched on October 6 2014. A goal of this developing initiative is to empower Cornell students to become active citizens and to tackle critical challenges by participating in hands-on, practical learning experiences in communities at home and around the world.

This transformational initiative is being established with a $50 million gift from the Einhorn Family Charitable Trust. https://now.cornell.edu/engaged/

Engaged Cornell will create a new model and direction for higher education – one in which public engagement is deeply ingrained, fully institutionalized and effectively taught and implemented. Through this initiative, students graduating from Cornell will enter the world as educated global citizens who practice respect and empathy; seek collaboration, cooperation and creativity; embrace differences and diversity in all aspects of their personal, professional and civic lives; and are dedicated to working together to help solve some of the world’s most intractable problems. In turn, the community will have “one-stop shopping” that will enhance current offices and related community activities.","The Department of Inclusion and Workforce Diversity was established in January 2000 to provide leadership to the Cornell community in the areas of equal opportunity, affirmative action and diversity. The office serves as a liaison to local community organizations that address the employment interests of individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups. https://www.hr.cornell.edu/about/wdi.html","In addition to the local organizations listed in E10, other connected groups include the Tompkins County Chamber of Commerce, Workforce New York, Tompkins County Human Services Coalition, Local Leaders of Color, area governments, the Village at Ithaca, and the Center for Transformative Action. http://www.centerfortransformativeaction.org","http://www.blackoakwindny.com

Development sites called for under this plan are presented to the Advisory Committee in advance of public presentations to community stakeholders outlined below. 

The 2010 Mount Vernon Campus Plan (Zoning Commission for the District of Columbia Zoning Commission Order 09-19) requires the university to maintain a community liaison program consisting of representatives of the University, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D, and the neighborhood. 
","GW endeavors to include and engage community stakeholders in a variety of regular meetings, events, and communications. All the activities listed below are publically noted and open to the public. This entails posting ads in local newspapers as well as online, sending e-mail invitations to community listservs, hosting the meeting after normal business hours and on weekends to ensure greater community availability, and hosting the meeting in open access buildings (no ID required) that are near public transportation.

• Campaign GW Presentations to Faculty, Staff, Students, and Alumni several times a year. Campaign GW is the student arm of the Division of Operations (the department on campus responsible for construction, campus planning, facilities management, etc.), which presents information to university stakeholders on campus development projects. Attendees have an opportunity to ask questions about construction on campus, the two university campus plans, and sign-up for monthly updates to receive more information. 
• Mount Vernon Campus Plan Quarterly Meetings hosted by GW (4 times a year) where university officials meet quarterly with community members to discuss and respond to issues of concern ranging from student behavior, to sporting events, to campus development. Often issues are raised at one meeting and the university works to resolve these issues before the next quarterly meeting. 
• Foggy Bottom Campus Plan Advisory Committee Meetings hosted by GW (4 times a year) where university officials meet quarterly with community members to discuss and respond to issues of concern ranging from student behavior, to sporting events, to campus development. Often issues are raised at one meeting and the university works to resolve these issues before the next quarterly meeting.
• Monthly FRIENDS Meetings/Community Events hosted by GW. FRIENDS is the name GW assigned its community engagement group in which attendees meet monthly to discuss concerns with the university and learn about engagement opportunities like speakers, course auditing, and sporting events. 
• Monthly Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANCs) Meeting Attendance by GW Staff. ANCs are the hyper-local governing bodies of neighborhoods in DC consisting of elected “Commissioners” that meet monthly to discuss regulatory matters and community concerns. University staff attend to present on matters that the ANC has purview over and also attend to stay abreast of broader community concerns unrelated to the university. This is often a good time to meet with city administrators and other elected officials to share information about what GW is doing in the community. 
• Quarterly Foggy Bottom Association (FBA) and Bi-Annual West End Citizens Association (WECA) Meeting Attendance by GW Staff. The FBA and WECA are the two civic associations that include the GW Foggy Bottom campus, and university staff attend their meetings to hear and respond to concerns related to the university as well as other community related news. Attendees at these civic association meetings don’t always attend ANC and other GW hosted meetings so it’s important to attend to hear from other members of the community. 
• Monthly Advertisements in DC Current Newspapers (delivered to 32,000 households in Northwest Washington, DC). 
• Bi-Annual Mailings to zip code 20037 (nearly 9,000 households) that include news stories related to the universities community engagement. 
• Large-Scale community invents including a fall “Block Party”, winter “Holiday Social” and “Spring BBQ” where neighbors are invited to the university for an afternoon of fun that allows them to engage with university staff, students, and faculty in an informal setting.","Students, Faculty, Staff and Alumni of GWU

","Valerie Aranda, Art and Dr. Sandra Godwin, Sociology, coteach a course entitled ""Art & Social Justice."" This upperlevel course explores social theories of empowerment and
community life and the way the visual arts, especially public murals, convey citizens’ history, values and aspirations. Pre and post-course surveys relative to engaged scholarship and ongoing reflective writing and discussion provide for student
dialogue about their learning. This year, students in the class are working with a neighborhood where residents are revitalizing their community with a neighborhood garden, fitness trails and community center programs. The students will collaborate with citizens to design and paint a mural. Dr. Godwin says, ""I am really excited about this course, especially since this year we have the opportunity to be a pilot course for the Quality Enhancement Plan. This semester, compared to the previous times we have taught the course, we will more formally assess students' learning as a result of their collaboration with community members on a mural project.”

Students in Dr. Jan Clark's Rhetoric practicum course have hosted community-wide viewings on front campus of the televised national presidential candidate debates since 2004, created a Baldwin County Voter's Directory of all elected and appointed city, county, state and national representatives and conducted voter education and registration presentations in classes as well as community locations. Dr. Clark says, ""The experiences they get through this class make our students so well equipped to serve their future communities as informed citizen advocates.""

Gregg Kaufman, Government & Sociology, an adjunct faculty member, teaches a core curriculum GC1Y Critical Thinking 1000 course called Public Deliberation. The course is
designed to help students explore the role of citizen involvement in community problem solving. Students learn neutral facilitation skills as well as how to research, design,
produce and use an issue book for facilitation based on a National Issues Forum model for deliberative forums. “I marvel at the positive comments students make after
facilitating a forum in the community. Students return to class with confidence in their ability to help citizens work through complex issues. They leave the course with practical skills and an understanding of the capacity for citizens' political activity,” said Kaufman.",https://engageatgc.wordpress.com/resources/quality-enhancement-plan/,--

Significant impact is defined as any number of the following:

•	Building a structure that can be easily viewed by multiple homes or businesses from off campus
•	Building a structure or system that increases traffic, water use, or other comparable public systems by more than 25% of current levels
•	Building a structure or system that will exceed one million dollars in cost
•	Implementing a plan that will significantly increase or decrease the number of jobs offered by the College or another business in town (a threshold of 10 jobs will be considered significant)
","The Special Advisory Committee will be called together by the GMC Cabinet prior to the College formally committing to the project. Cabinet will do its best to identify a representative group of community stakeholders, including stakeholders from underrepresented populations. The Committee will meet at least once with at least one member of Cabinet, but as many times as Cabinet deems necessary. 
The Committee will serve the following purposes:
•	Listen to the project proposal
•	Offer feedback on how the proposed project may impact the community positively and/or negatively
•	Help the College decide if the broader community needs to be informed and/or consulted based on how likely it is that the project will affect the community significantly
•	 If deemed necessary, help the College identify an appropriate mechanism for informing and garnering input from the broader community, whether that be through a public meeting, a newsletter such as front porch forum, a website, or a mailing. 
•	Help the College navigate necessary laws, regulations, or permits. 

Following the meeting(s) with the Special Advisory Committee, the College will inform/consult the broader public through the agreed upon mechanism if the Committee deemed it necessary to do so. Input from the Special Advisory Committee and/or the broader community will be considered in the decision of whether or not to move forward with the project and under what circumstances. 
","The Special Advisory Committee may consist of members such as:
•	The Town Manager of Poultney
•	A member of the PDRC (Poultney Downtown Revitalization Committee) chosen by the PDRC
•	An owner of a local business chosen by the Poultney Chamber of Commerce
•	A citizen of Poultney, or surrounding towns, who is not formally affiliated with any of the other organizations represented on the advisory committee (this person could be chosen by a GMC staff member who has a close working relationship with underrepresented populations in the community). 
","The protocol for community stakeholder engagement was only recently implemented, but Green Mountain College has a long, rich history of deep engagement with the community. For example, since 2013, the College has been leading an effort called Poultney 2020, a town-wide community building process aimed at building the vibrancy of the Town. As part of this effort, the College frequently hosts planning meetings to gather the people working on the project. Another example includes the community conversations that the College holds at least once a year. For the last two years, the public has been invited to these meetings, where the College's goals and progress toward those goals were discussed. More community conversations are being planned for the 2014-2015 academic year. ",http://sustainability.greenmtn.edu/living_learning/beyond_classroom/outreach.aspx,--

Michigan State University,2016-02-16,2016-02-16 09:19:31,erhardt7@msu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The Provost's Committee on University Outreach (1993) defines outreach as scholarship that cuts across teaching, research, and service. It involves generating, transmitting, applying, and preserving knowledge for the direct benefit of external audiences.

As a land-grant institution, Michigan State University has a mandate to develop, apply, and share knowledge to serve the public good. MSU advocates a scholarly model of outreach and engagement that fosters a reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationship between the University and the public.

The Office of the Associate Provost for University Outreach and Engagement (UOE) fosters MSU's land-grant mission by connecting university knowledge with community knowledge in mutually beneficial ways. UOE provides resources to assist academic departments, centers and institutes, and MSU Extension on priority issues of concern to society by encouraging, supporting, and collaborating with MSU faculty and academic staff to generate, apply, transmit and preserve knowledge.

This scholarship focus is applied to a broad range of community-defined needs, with special focus on:
    Children, youth, and families
    Community-economic development
    Technology-human interface
    Community health and well-being

Within these contexts, UOE also engages in research designed to demonstrate the disciplinary and inter-disciplinary impact of engaged scholarship and on faculty work and university-community partnerships.

In all of its work, UOE emphasizes university-community partnerships that are collaborative, participatory, empowering, systemic, transformative, and anchored in scholarship.","Given that most social issues are complex in nature, MSU promotes multidisciplinary approaches to outreach and engagement. It does this by:

1. developing the Office of University Outreach and Engagement, which supports outreach work and creates teams to address community-identified social issues
2.  investing in centers, institutes, and communities of interest around issues such as children's health, community vitality, land policy, and usability and accessibility related to information technology.

North Carolina State University,2016-01-28,2016-01-28 13:27:54,lindsay_batchelor@ncsu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Community stakeholder engagement happens throughout NC State. Below are three examples of this engagement: the university’s strategic plan which guides the university’s vision and decision-making, NC Cooperative Extension which provides all citizens with access to the wealth of knowledge generated by public universities and the University of North Carolina (UNC) System’s strategic plan.

University Strategic Plan: Chancellor Randy Woodson initiated the formation of a new strategic plan for the university in 2010 by charging the provost and chair of the faculty with directing the process with advice from an 11-member steering committee. Nine task forces comprised of faculty, staff and students produced white papers with recommendations for university strategies, specific initiatives and metrics. The resulting document, “The Pathway to the Future: NC State’s 2011-2020 Strategic Plan,” was endorsed by the Board of Trustees in April 2011 and guides the university’s vision and decision-making through the end of the decade. New information will be added to this site as work progresses on achieving the strategic plan goals.

All members of the campus community were invited and encouraged to provide input and feedback during the strategic planning process. The Chancellor’s Installation Town Hall Forum provided an opportunity for the Chancellor and others leading the strategic planning efforts to hear from members of the campus at large. Individual task forces solicited input on specific topics. The community could provide feedback to the Strategic Planning Committee at any time via a feedback form. There were additionally mechanisms to receive planning updates.

NC Cooperative Extension: The NC Cooperative Extension Service partners with communities to deliver education and technology that enrich the lives, land and economy of North Carolinians. Cooperative Extension provides educational programming in five key areas: sustaining agriculture and forestry, protecting the environment, maintaining viable communities, developing responsible youth and developing strong, healthy and safe families. The partnerships includes county governments working to solve local problems, a national network of land-grant universities including NC State and NC A&T State University, and the US Department of Agriculture working together, in recognition that we achieve much more together than we can alone.  The partnerships with agriculture, business, education, government and industry create a unique culture of collaboration that increases productivity and fuels economic development. As an example, more than 22,500 citizen advisers help coordinate programming to address local needs.

UNC System Level: In response to the UNC strategic plan, “Our Time, Our Future,” which calls for an annual engagement report, UNC’s Office of International, Community and Economic Engagement worked with the UNC Economic Transformation Council and the UNC Engagement Council to produce a first-time analysis of how UNC campuses, students and faculty are connected to and engaged with local/regional community partners via experiential courses and initiatives, research, and public service. This-high level summary provides an overview of our local, regional and state-wide impacts on communities and the economy, and challenges the system to bring together partners across the state to increase such “communiversity”-building activity. ","NC State unveiled a new outreach and engagement plan for 2015-2020 that includes a targeted approach to outreach and engagement that: focuses on resources, eliminates duplication, harnesses valuable expertise, analyzes gaps and facilitates opportunities for stronger partnerships. The plan, titled “The New Engagement: A Bold Statement of Colliding Concepts Transcending Traditional Solutions,” was presented at a Launch Summit and crafted from the hard work and efforts of the Engagement Partnership Council.

The plan is structured around three main goals. The first goal, promote
a culture of engagement, supports our commitment to rewarding new
and innovative ideas. Resources will be expended to catalog our programs
and activities and clearly articulate a set of institutional metrics for regularly
measuring and assessing the impact of our engagement work from multiple
stakeholder perspectives. 

Therefore, the second goal, community collaboration and partnerships, is rooted in our commitment to enhancing collaboration across our campus so that we might, in turn, deepen and improve partnerships, practices and relationships that encourage collaboration and reciprocity.

And finally, we will utilize best practices to build NC State’s capacity to make a
difference by extending resources, sharing expertise, applying research outcomes and seeking new opportunities to listen and learn. To this end, we will align our efforts to with NC State’s commitment to diversify funding sources.

Taken together, these goals will both support the university’s strategic planning efforts and proudly fulfill the promise of our institution’s powerful brand. In this way, we will contribute to a climate in which the university can powerfully “Think and Do” well beyond our own borders.","Though it is not possible to list all of NC State University's community stakeholders, the Office of Outreach and Engagement houses a website dedicated to engagement and partnerships. The site is searchable by audience, topic, location or keyword and is an excellent resource for forwarding community engagement with NC State.
","Example 1: Seeds, Sweet Potatoes and Sprouting Knowledge: Teaching About Healthy Food Systems with Place-Based Education in Classrooms, Cafeterias, School Gardens and Local Communities
FoodCorps North Carolina: Growing Healthy Children, Future Leaders FoodCorps is a national non-profit that “strives to give all children an enduring relationship with healthy food through the hands and minds of emerging leaders.” Working in partnership with local communities and organizations, FoodCorps service members aim to change children’s attitudes and behaviors towards food through nutrition education, school garden engagement, and accessibility of healthy produce through local farm-to-cafeteria pathways.
FoodCorps NC envisions a North Carolina where children know what healthy food looks and tastes like, how it grows, and where it comes from. More importantly, the organization wants every child in the state to have access to healthy food every day. Such children would also be knowledgeable about the agricultural roots of the state, and - immersed in a healthy food environment at a young age - will learn better, live longer, and liberate their generation from diet-related diseases. At the same time, FoodCorps service members will become emerging leaders who will become farmers, chefs, educators and public health professionals. Armed with the skills to improve school food, these leaders will go on to improve entire food and health systems across the state.
Sharing expertise and passion - in other words, serving - beyond the borders of the halls of higher learning is a core part of NC State’s mission. It is commitment to that humble, but powerful mission that fuels the CEFS’ partnership of programs like FoodCorps NC.

Example 2: Connecting Chowan County High School Students to Bennett’s Millpond Through STEM
It’s serious science - not recreation - that each year brings Chowan County high school students to Bennett’s Millpond, which is one of North Carolina’s exquisite coastal swamp ecosystems. For the past seven years, students have been working with the Science House at North Carolina University to conduct experiments at the millpond - monitoring the health of the ecosystem, identifying the microorganisms that thrive there and learning about the delicate balance of chemicals and nutrients that sustain life. 
The Bennett’s Millpond Project is a collaborative program for aquatic environmental learning in a highly unique and historic space - the colonial-era millpond near Edenton, North Carolina. The program aims to facilitate research and data collection on water quality, hydrology of the area, meteorology and aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna.
Bringing together four partners - The Science House, the Albermarle Learning Center, Chowan County and NC State University, the project initially took place through the Northeast Office of The Science House and later evolved into a collaborative partnership with the Northeast STEM Consortium.

Example 3: Catching Business for Coastal North Carolina
For nearly a decade, North Carolina Sea Grant has worked with coastal North Carolina communities to develop “local catch” programs focusing on business development and education to connect consumers to fishermen and local seafood. Today, Brunswick Cath, Cateret Catch, Ocracoke Fresh and Outer Banks Catch are thriving with members that include fishing families, processors, wholesale and retail sales managers; restaurant owners, chefs and staff; and a range of community partners. A statewide program called ‘North Carolina Catch’ helps the local groups collaborate and also serves other coastal counties.
The varied partners use market research tools to help breathe new life into a struggling industry and the projects stresses innovative techniques, use of interdisciplinary research and resources, risk taking, teamwork, inclusive thinking and sensitivity and attention to diverse audiences.
NC State is the home for many partners in these efforts, including Cooperative Extension, Seafood Laboratory, Center for Marine Sciences and Technology, Center for Environmental Farming Systems, Department of Food Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Department of Horticultural Science. The project also involves several other university partners - University of North Carolina Wilmington, East Carolina University, Coastal Studies Institute, UNC-TV and Duke University - from across the state.
But the list of partners does not stop there. North Carolina Cath also works with the U.S Department of Agriculture, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ Division of Marine Fisheries. Additional state and local partners include the NC Fisheries Association, the Outer Banks Seafood Festival, the North Carolina Seafood Festival, Saltwater Connections and the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum and Heritage Center.

Original plans - which called for running the pipeline through a residential neighborhood.- were developed by Columbia Gas in consultation with Penn State, but without sufficient input from all stakeholders in the community.  Opposition by residents along the proposed route forced Penn State to re-route the line through campus at considerably higher cost.

Rice University,2016-03-25,2016-03-25 16:33:19,rrj@rice.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Rice’s Vision for the Second Century, which is the foundational strategic vision for the university that has been adopted by the Board of Trustees, explicitly highlights the need to increase its community engagement with the city of Houston.  Specifically, the 10-point vision states as its final point that as a university, “We must fully engage with the city of Houston—learning from it and contributing to it—as a successful partnership with our home city as an essential part of our future.  We should do so by continuing to integrate Houston into the educational experience of our students, by emphasizing selective areas of research especially important to the city (notably energy and urban studies), by making tangible contributions to improve our city (particularly K-12 education and environmental quality), and by continuing to provide innovative educational and cultural resources to the broader Houston population.” 

The Vision for the Second Century serves as the formal policy for community stakeholder engagement at Rice.  Furthermore, Rice has procedures and a commitment to ensure that community stakeholder engagement is applied systematically and regularly across the institution's activities. 

In terms of strategy and operations, Rice has a Strategy and Planning Committee. The Vice President of Public Affairs sits on this committee, representing the interests of the community, and the Vice President for Resource Development represents the interests of the community through stewardship contacts.  

In terms of governance, the board of trustees reaches out and identifies community stakeholders within the community who are representative of important business sectors as well as constituent groups within the city of Houston, and more broadly, the state of the nation.

Rice’s Public Affairs group hosts quarterly community luncheons with 30 representatives of neighborhood groups, non-profits, vendors, and other key stakeholders in the area immediately surrounding the university to share information, discuss issues, and otherwise engage with community leaders.

Overall, community engagement is a top priority for the University, and essentially every element of Rice has adopted this vision as an overarching mantra.
","According to David Medina, Rice’s director of Multicultural Community Relations (MCR), Rice University seeks to maintain a diverse community at all levels and “to build bridges whenever essential and dismantle walls wherever necessary.”  The Multicultural Community Relations organization was established to enhance relationships between Rice and the minority communities inside and outside the university.  Multicultural Community Relations extends Rice’s wealth of enrichment opportunities to everyone in the Houston community through coordination with local multicultural groups.  These groups comprise current students, alumni, and neighborhood and city associations: 
(1) Community Dialogue Luncheons: Community Dialogue Luncheons serve as a forum for community leaders to discuss social issues that affect all sectors of society.  Offered quarterly, these luncheons provide an informal round table for engaging discussion and idea sharing and encourage people form various ethnic and cultural backgrounds to get to know each other and form a network. 

(2) Rice Connection Speaker Series: Multicultural Community Relations launched a new program in December 2010, the Rice Connection Speaker Series, in which a Houston community leader is invited to present a lecture to Rice faculty, staff and students about a pressing social issue.  The participating group is limited to 25 guests.  Each luncheon focuses on a timely topic and hosts a different set of goals. 

(3) K-12 Outreach Programs: Through a number of outreach programs, Rice University fosters a culture of understanding between diverse people, ideas and perspectives.  The following are some of the programs offered: 
-College information sessions and career day appearances: MCR conducts age-appropriate, on-campus sessions for students in high school, middle school and elementary school to create an awareness of the steps needed to access college admission and financial resources for college. During these sessions, Rice undergraduates share their strategies for navigating the college admission and financial aid process. When possible, Rice professors provide interactive academic enrichment sessions. MCR also provides similar presentations on-site for community schools.
-Davila Science Conference: MCR partners with Davila Elementary School to host an interactive science conference for its fourth- and fifth-graders. In addition to hosting the event, MCR recruits Rice faculty and students as well as community members from the Davila family, for whom the school is named, to present at this event. Since 2009, 375 students have attended since 2009.
-College essay camp for rising seniors: This program consists of a week-long writing workshop designed to help students create a high-quality college admission essay, as well as help them understand the college admission process.  Classes are offered to 50 rising seniors who have taken a college preparatory curriculum and who come from low-to-moderate-income families","The 10-county greater Houston metropolitan area has a population of approximately 6 million people, and different elements within Rice have different lists of community stakeholders based upon what they aspire to accomplish at the University.  Thus, a comprehensive list of identified community stakeholders at Rice would be extensive.  A small sample of such stakeholders would include:
 
Boulevard Oaks Civic Association
Christ the King Lutheran Church
Congregation Emanu El Houston
Emmanuel Episcopal Church
Hermann Park Conservancy
Houston City Council District C Office 
Houston Hillel
Houston Museum District
Morningside Place Civic Club
Museum Area Municipal Association
Old Braeswood Property Owners Association
Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church
Rice Catholic Student Center 
Rice Village Alliance
South Main Alliance
Southampton Extension Civic Association
Southgate Civic Club
Texas Medical Center
University Place Association 
","Over the past three years, Rice has had a number of successful community stakeholder engagement outcomes.  The following are a few notable outcomes: 
(1) Rice University Centennial Luncheon Honoring the Houston Community: This Centennial event was specifically intended to recognize Rice University’s supporters and friends in the Houston and Texas communities.  300 community members attended, and showed their support for the University’s mission. 

(2) Centennial Grove Tree Planting: More than 75 volunteers gathered at Hermann Park on November 16th, 2012 to plant the Rice Centennial grove in recognition of the centennials of Rice University (2012) and Hermann Park (2014).  In just a few hours, the volunteers—consisting of Rice faculty, staff and students and Houston community members—planted 100 oak, bald cypress and other native trees in a reforestation area close to the park’s boathouse and picnic areas on the east side of McGovern Lake.  

(3) Parking permit regulations: In an effort to respect neighboring community members and their parking availability, Rice implemented stricter parking regulations.  The regulations explicitly state that, “Rice values its cordial relations with area residents, businesses and institutions and looks to the members of the Rice community to help maintain these positive relationships.  In furtherance of those relationships, Rice views, and encourages its faculty, staff and students to also view, available on-street parking in the residential neighborhoods near Rice as being intended and reserved for the primary use of the residents of these neighborhoods and their visitors.  When visiting residents or working at Rice-owned properties, Rice students, staff, faculty, contractors and guests are asked and expected to park in university-provided parking facilities, not on neighborhood streets.”  

(4) Campus updates: Rice University is committed to establishing a mutually beneficial relationship with Houston’s community leaders and our neighbors.  To accomplish that, Rice’s staff goes out of its way to participate in community events and keep its neighbors informed about what is taking place on campus.  These campus updates are continuously updated on the University Relations webpage, and are intended to inform community members of upcoming events, such as construction and performances, which may impact Rice’s neighboring areas.

Successful community engagement is not an accident. It requires careful planning, consultation and collaboration with the community and local jurisdictions along with effective execution and financial resources.  Being a good neighbor enhances both the community and the university. 
Stanford University’s Office of Public Affairs and more specifically the Office of Government and Community Relations (GCR) coordinates and facilitates Stanford's interactions with local, state and federal governments, as well as its relationship with neighboring communities.

GCR promotes the interests of the University's faculty, students and staff through contact with public officials, involvement with educational organizations, tracking of pertinent legislation and lobbying on behalf of the University on a wide variety of issues from land use policies to funding for the basic sciences.

The GCR also serves as a liaison between Stanford and its neighboring communities by maintaining relations with numerous community-based organizations and individuals while also supporting the campus-community that contributes to the vitality of the greater community. Annual Community Partnership Awards (http://www.stanford.edu/dept/govcr/community-partnership-awards)  are awarded each year to honor the valuable partnerships that exist between Stanford and its neighbors, and to celebrate community efforts that successfully tackle real world problems and advance the public good. 
","Academic Focused Community Engagement

Stanford’s founding grant states the university’s “object” succinctly: “to qualify its students for personal success, and direct usefulness in life.” Today, more than a century later, we still subscribe to that goal. But we also hope for more. We want our students not simply to succeed but to flourish; we want them to live not only usefully but also creatively, responsibly, and reflectively. 

In January 2010, Provost John Etchemendy and then Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman launched “The Study of Undergraduate Education at Stanford University” (SUES). SUES was asked to examine the undergraduate experience at Stanford and make “recommendations for affirming or modifying our current undergraduate academic requirements.” In particular, it was asked “What do we want our students to gain from their time on the Farm?”  and “How do we best prepare them for local, national, and global citizenship?”

An essential aim of a Stanford education is if our graduates are to assume the responsibilities of local, national, and global citizenship, they need not only deep knowledge and well-honed skills but also a wider set of characteristics and competencies: a sense of personal and social responsibility; ethical and moral reasoning skills; an appreciation of cultural difference, as well as of human commonality; the ability to work collaboratively in diverse teams; tolerance, generosity, and a broad capacity for empathy. 

With this in mind, many departments and programs have devised innovative courses and assignments that powerfully engage students without their having to venture far from the Farm. Students studying music, drama, and the studio arts routinely stage performances and exhibitions. Engineers work in teams to design, fabricate, and test products, working with actual clients. Students studying child development observe children at the Bing Nursery School, while students studying biology take courses at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, where many become docents. While relatively simple and inexpensive to administer, such exercises pay large educational dividends. They offer students a literal and figurative change of scenery, an opportunity to relate what they are learning in the classroom to the wider world. 

Over the last generation, community-based learning has emerged as one of the most exciting fields in American higher education, a field that promises not only to deepen students’ education but also to reshape universities’ relationship to the wider world. Few if any enterprises hold more promise for building the essential capacities that our students need to function as responsible, reflective citizens at the local, national, and global levels. And few if any universities in the world have a greater opportunity to promote ethical, effective community-based learning than Stanford. 

The SUES committee distinguishes “community-based learning” from what is commonly called “community service.”  At Stanford, as at many other highly selective universities, community service is now a virtual requirement for admission, and most of our students have done a considerable amount of it before they arrive on campus. Many continue to engage in service at Stanford, some- times under university auspices, sometimes in independent organizations (some founded by students themselves). For a few, community service is the defining feature of their undergraduate educations. 

Here, however, we wish to highlight something different—not service per se, but rather a specific kind of university-based learning. We are interested in particular in educational experiences that thoughtfully and purposefully connect students’ service in the community with their academic work. Like other forms of educational engagement, community-based learning provides opportunities for students to apply the knowledge and skills they are developing to the wider world, but it does so in a very particular context, with significant ethical and political implications. We believe that teaching students to think reflectively about the nature of their service work, to approach communities not just as beneficiaries of their aid but as partners in a common enterprise, will make the work more effective, ethical, enduring, and educational. ","Below is a list of community stakeholders that Stanford University identified as part of its Searsville Dam and Reservoir Study: 
Local governments 
Local residents & community members
Local community groups (ex. Acterra, the Committee for Green Foothills, CalTrout, Santa Clara Audobon, American Rivers, Beyond Searsville Dam)
San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority
Caltrans
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
California Department of Fish and Wildlife
California State Water Resources Control Board
Santa Clara Valley Water District
","Searsville Dam and Reservoir Study: 

The Searsville Dam and Reservoir Study and the establishment of the Searsville Steering Committee  and Working Group was implemented to assess what should be done with the 120-year-old dam, located in the university's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. This effort touches on many topics including land use, water systems, and sustainability.

The dam was built in 1892 by the for-profit Spring Valley Water Co. and acquired by the university in 1919. Today, sedimentation has reduced the reservoir to less than 10 percent of its original water capacity. The reservoir is one of several sources of non-potable water used at Stanford for landscape irrigation, agriculture and fire protection. The ecosystem created by the dam also is a key aspect of environmental research conducted at Jasper Ridge. 

The steering committee is considering many possible options for Searsville Dam and the studies will cover some 20 subtopics, including, for example, dam structure and long-term integrity, downstream impacts from changes in sediment, fish passage and archaeological resources. Possible changes to be considered as part of the studies range from dredging the reservoir to bypassing the dam to altering or removing it. Also factored into the studies will be the possible effect of such occurrences as droughts, catastrophic storms and earthquakes.

The studies are also considering other issues related to Searsville, including alternatives to the current water supply and storage facilities, provision of fish passage, the change in the amount of sediment going downstream and options for removing accumulated sediment from 12 decades of deposition. Stanford is equally concerned about the steelhead population and has been working for more than a decade to improve the habitat for it and other protected species in the San Francisquito Creek watershed and on Stanford lands in general.

The effort has included the creation of an external advisory committee to help the university understand the community's perspective on the numerous options possible at Searsville Dam and Reservoir.  Community representatives include residents from both upstream and downstream of the dam and reservoir, community based advocacy and environmental groups, local jurisdictional representatives and other stakeholders (see description in response to EN Credit 9: Community Partnerships). 

Other community engagement activities are often conducted by community engagement oriented offices at Stanford. These include:

ESF's strategic plan, Vision 2020, has the stated priority to ""build and enhance partnerships and collaborative relationships"", which in turn will ""strengthen ESF’s ability to achieve the goals outlined in the strategic plan"". Furthermore, ""ESF’s academic programs are strengthened through strong collaborative relationships with industry, government and others that provide valuable insight into future educational needs for a productive workforce"". Specific targets to achieve under this plan include establishing ""additional external advisory councils"" and ""strengthening links with program related industries, other educational institutions,alumni and government organizations"". 

ESF's 2011 self-study for MSCHE reaccreditation reaffirms these goals stating: ESF ""...embraces the public trust placed in it by the people of New York State and accepts the responsibility to advance knowledge in the College’s specialized areas of study. ESF will fulfill this duty consistent with the core values of discovery, community and service. As part of the State University of New York, ESF’s service to the community extends beyond the bounds of the campus. The College is committed to sharing its discoveries and knowledge with public and private constituencies, organizations and citizens throughout our state, our nation, and the world.""

ESF is currently in the process of updating our college's strategic plan which will further elucidate these goals and how they are being achieved, and how we can continue to improve., The Office of Sustainability intends to work with campus and community stakeholders in 2016 to draft an explicit policy on how the broad range of stakeholder engagement that already takes place can be applied more comprehensively across the institution to further ""identify and engage community stakeholders in the college or university’s ongoing governance, strategy and operations"" in accord with AASHE's criteria for community stakeholder engagement under this credit. ESF is also working to compile a comprehensive list of the dozens, possibly hundreds of stakeholder groups that the college is currently or recently engaged with. 
","One of the primary ways that ESF identifies, engages and serves community stakeholders is through a variety of research and outreach centers. A brief description of these various centers' community involvement is provided below. 

The Center for Community Design Research (CCDR) is an outreach program within SUNY ESF Department of Landscape Architecture. Working in partnership with communities, elected officials, agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and other academic programs, the CCDR provides technical assistance, educational programs, and research projects that build community capacity to manage sustainable futures.

Drawing from the natural and cultural history of the Adirondacks and the Northern Forest, NFI provides unique and place-based environmental education and outreach. 
http://www.esf.edu/nfi/

Outreach at ESF is teaching, research, and service that engages the college with external groups. Outreach activities support environmental, educational, social and economic development in ways that advance both the public good and ESF's mission. To these ends, ESF faculty, staff and students, along with our partners, pursue a diverse range of programs and projects—all with an aim to enhance leadership, education, and practice in the science, design, engineering and management of natural resources and the environment. 
http://www.esf.edu/outreach/about.htm

The ESF Office of Government Relations links the College with the community, elected officials, and agencies to communicate the challenges and opportunities facing ESF, our academic and research areas, and higher education. We work to develop relationships with those who have an opportunity to affect our future and fulfill our vision of “a better world through environmental discovery.

Stevens Institute of Technology,2016-03-24,2016-03-24 15:22:47,gotham360@stevens.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"As Stevens Institute of Technology continues to grow, it has recognized that it must involve community stakeholders in its master planning process.  As a campus within an urban setting, the university makes a big impact on the local community.  There is constant communication with neighbors and the city as a whole to ensure that the interests of all parties are being met.  One example is community stakeholder engagement with the design of a new academic research building.  Members of the Hoboken community have been involved in the design process of the building and the grounds, providing feedback as to what they want to see in the new building.  These discussions with community stakeholders have been integral in the new design and proposed operations of the building.  Through this planning process, Stevens has made a commitment to include the community in its decisions.","Through formal, sponsored programs and partnerships and through organic, grassroots collaborations, Stevens identifies and engages community stakeholders. Examples include the Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education, the volunteer efforts of student-run organizations, community open house events and information sessions, such as that which was recently held related to the Academic Gateway Building in April and May of 2014, and self-selecting organic outreach from various community organizations such as the Hoboken Family Alliance or local scout troops. Stevens Connects also features an inquiry submission feature on it's website which allows anyone within the community to submit a request for collaboration, volunteer resources, and more. Additional information is listed in ""A brief description of community stakeholder engagement outcomes from the past three years.""","K-12 Teachers and students, afterschool programs for URM, the Hoboken business community, local churches, neighbors, other non-profits like Boys and Girl Scout Troops, the Hoboken Quality of Life Coalition, the Hoboken Family Alliance, and Hoboken cultural organizations such as the Arts & Music Festival and Garden Street Farmers Market.","For more than 25 years, the university’s Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education (CIESE) has secured grants totaling $50 million to support programs aimed at improving science, math and engineering education in elementary and high schools throughout New Jersey, the nation, and in a dozen countries around the world.  Hoboken Public Schools was CIESE’s very first partner, and has remained a collaborator in more than two dozen funded programs over more than 25 years. More than 250 teachers and thousands of students have benefited from CIESE’s programs, including teacher training, student camps, and donations of hardware, software, and classroom supplies. 

During Orientation, one of the first ways our freshman engage in student life is through community service activities in Hoboken. Students experience the city by organizing crafts for children at the Garden Street Farmers Market, cleaning local parking garages, and painting a mural at the Jubilee Center.Stevens hosts the Hoboken Junior Police Academy, a free camp for Hoboken students, which provides hands-on experience with the role of a police offer and insight into career in law enforcement.

In June 2014, in one of many ongoing efforts to help manage traffic and reduce the university’s carbon footprint, Stevens donated 16 bikes and five bike helmets for use by Bike Hoboken. Stevens is also an active participant and convener for Hoboken’s tech community including the NJ Tech Meet Up and other public forums and events held by the City of Hoboken.

Stevens continues to dedicate its technical expertise to solving real-world problems in our community. Many student researchers use their Senior Design Projects, products of a year or more of extensive research, to help build products and solve issues that exist within Hoboken and surrounding areas. Notable among these research projects are an Interactive Flood Wall, a series of permanent levees and removable flood walls to create and economical and resident-friendly flood resiliency plan; a Modular Green Roof, an innovative design that integrates plant life upon a lightweight, independently supported module to significantly reduce storm water runoff and ultimately flooding; and Hoboken Taxi Re-engineering, a solution to eliminate excessive waiting and long lines for the Hoboken Taxi System. 
Read more about community-focused student research.

Stevens faculty members have worked closely with several public agencies on plans for enhancing the resilience of waterfront communities, business districts and essential infrastructure in the face of increased flood risk and vulnerability to storm damage.

Students, faculty, and staff, as well as alumni, are active volunteers to many Hoboken programs and causes—from fraternity tutoring programs in schools, to set-up for the City’s spring and fall festivals, to sports clinics for Hoboken’s youth.  A few examples follow:

Community service is one of the first things Stevens students experience; a variety of community service options are identified for Orientation activities for the freshman class each year.

In August 2014, students and student-athletes volunteered their time to entertain local families and youth at Hoboken’s National Night Out, an effort to promote community partnerships for crime prevention.
In the week following Hurricane Sandy, 300 students performed more than 2,000 hours of volunteer work – working with the National Guard to rescue people stranded by the storm, delivering water in high-rise buildings, checking in on elderly residents, working with the Hoboken Volunteer Ambulance Corps, helping prepare meals for people who had taken refuge in city shelters, providing the city with an audio system for public meetings and helping to staff a city command center.

Numerous student groups on campus are dedicated to community service. From staffing community events to cleaning up local parks, Greek Life, Service organizations, Student Government, and more are committed to making a positive impact in our city.

Women’s Soccer, Men’s Lacrosse and other teams have hosted sports clinics and tournaments for local children and youth teams. Over 100 student–athletes volunteer through the Duckling Program, led by the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, to read and plan lessons for local middle school students.",http://www.stevens.edu/stevensconnects,--

Temple University,2016-02-09,2016-02-09 14:47:23,kathleen.grady@temple.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Temple University promotes civic engagement for all members of the Temple community.  Faculty, staff, students and alumni are encouraged to donate their time to nonprofit, faith based and civic organizations.  Policies and procedures differ within each department at Temple as it relates to community stakeholder engagement.  The Office of Community Relations is the main point of contact for external community stakeholders that wish to connect with the university.   Throughout the year, unifying projects are planned and implemented to encourage the entire Temple community to participate in volunteerism.  Examples include Freshmen Orientation, which includes service projects as part of the itinerary; Alumni Global Day of Service, a program that encourages volunteerism from graduates of Temple in venues located nationally and internationally; and the MLK Day of Service, in which the Temple community devotes time to beautification projects, workshops and health screenings. 

For the two campuses, Main and the Health Sciences, that are adjacent to predominately residential communities, the university ensures community stakeholder engagement in several ways:
•	Nonprofits.  Meetings are held periodically with nonprofit organizations that are providing services in the local communities as a way to keep them informed about university programs and resources and support them in establishing peer-to-peer partnerships.
•	Community Campus Councils.  Committees have been established of residential community leaders and university staff to discuss and receive feedback regarding any significant policies or activities that impact the surrounding communities.  The members of the Council are either representatives of civic organizations or block captains.  For example, in December 2014 the university’s senior staff met with the Councils to present the draft of Visualize Temple, the new land use plan, and solicit feedback.
•	Registered Community Organizations. The City of Philadelphia’s Zoning Code provides a framework for organized communication between zoning applicants and community groups that register with the Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC) to represent their neighborhoods in zoning matters. These Registered Community Organizations (RCOs) receive the benefit of early notice of significant zoning proposals in their neighborhoods. For zoning applicants, the RCO system provides a reliable 45-day timeframe for community input and a mechanism to identify and contact community organizations.  The PCPC checks applications submitted by organizations – including volunteer organizations, civic associations, Pennsylvania nonprofit corporations, and unincorporated associations – using six criteria. The PCPC will accept a group as an RCO if it has all of the following: 
1. An adopted statement of purpose for the organization concerning land use, zoning, or related concern, AND 
2. A geographic area with no more than 20,000 parcels, AND 
3. Boundaries that are set forth in the organization’s governing rules, AND 
4. Meetings that are publicly announced through hard copy or electronic notices, AND 
5. Open meetings on a regularly scheduled basis, AND 
6. Leadership chosen by the membership of the organization-at-large through an election process. 

Neighborhood Improvement Districts, Special Services Districts, and Ward Committees are the only types of organizations that do not need to satisfy these six criteria and automatically qualify as RCOs upon submission of a complete application form to the PCPC.  


","The university has established community councils and a network of non-profits, and meets with the groups that have identified as a registered community organization (see above for a description of registered community organizations. 

The areas surrounding the Health Sciences and Main campuses are the second poorest areas in the City.  The majority of nonprofit organizations with whom the university staff interact provide social or support services to these populations, which provides another pathway for communicating with residents, especially those that are the most vulnerable.

Every college and support unit—in collaboration with its constituents—has developed a strategic plan to prioritize objectives and guide decision-making.  All strategic plans must address the four institution-wide goals fundamental to Ohio State’s mission and future success:  Teaching and Learning; Research and Innovation; Outreach and Engagement; and Resource Stewardship. The Outreach and Engagement goal works to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the citizens and institutions of Ohio, the nation, and the world so that our communities are actively engaged in the exciting work of The Ohio State University.","As a charter land-grant institution, Ohio State continues to focus on outreach and engagement as an integral component of its teaching, research, and service activities and initiatives. The university is committed to finding new ways to include and promote engagement scholarship as something that creates meaningful and mutually beneficial collaboration with partners in education, business, industry, public, private, and social services to ensure that it “advances the well-being of the people of Ohio and the global community through the creation and dissemination of knowledge.” http://www.oaa.osu.edu/vision-mission-values-goals.html

External partnerships across public and private sectors continue to be an integral component of Ohio State’s overall engagement strategy, as the university constantly seeks opportunities for cultivating new university-level partnerships to complement the myriad of existing ones. The system for identifying and cultivating partnerships across the breadth and scope of the institution remains decentralized within each of the colleges and academic support units – and by extension, their subordinate departments, centers, and institutes. The internal collaboration of these units and the external partnerships they have developed are fundamental to the university’s core missions of teaching, research, and service. Partnerships enhance student academic experiences and support faculty by providing opportunities for engagement scholarship that complement their teaching and research activities.
","At the local, state, national and international level, Ohio State community stakeholders include:  community groups, non-profit organizations, individuals, educational institutions, businesses/industry, governments, students, faculty and staff, alumni, donors","The descriptions below include just a few of the successes from the past three years include:

The Field to Faucet initiative is an innovative suite of research and extension efforts by The Ohio State University aimed at ensuring safe drinking water while keeping farms productive and profitable. The initiative began in 2014 after a water quality crisis in Lake Erie due to harmful algal blooms galvanized an interdisciplinary group of partners to seek end-to-end, systems solutions to the problem affecting the lake. A sister effort, co-led by Ohio State and the University of Toledo, created a complementary set of research and development projects funded by the Ohio Department of Higher Education. Ohio State and partners have a mission to help communities and individuals make choices that help maintain water quality while balancing other important needs such as food production.  http://field2faucet.osu.edu/home 

Graduate students and staff from the Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic partnered with Hilltop Preschool in an on-site, pre-K literacy intervention program to improve reading/comprehension levels and build a better support system for parents and teachers. After 11 weeks, the results showed 89 percent of students demonstrated higher literacy scores.  artsandsciences.osu.edu/news 

Energize Ohio is a multidisciplinary program that addresses a wide range of energy education topics including shale energy, renewable energy, energy policy, on-farm energy, youth education, landowner leasing, and sustainable community planning. The curriculum consists of worksheets, presentation materials, workshop materials, bulletins, fact sheets, marketing templates, and evaluation tools. The ultimate goal of Energize Ohio is to enhance community leaders’ and local residents’ knowledge of energy drivers and development in order to promote informed decision-making and best practices. In 2014, OSU Extension taught more than 700 Ohioans how to prepare for, attract, and develop potential renewable energy projects. In 2014, OSU Extension delivered 32 programs, reaching 1,191 people, on shale energy-related topics. In total, since 2012 the Energize Ohio Signature Program team has delivered 141 programs in 64 of Ohio’s 88 counties, reaching 11,688 participants.  http://energizeohio.osu.edu/ 

The Endeavor Center is a vibrant example of community-university collaboration to realize a shared vision in an economically distressed Appalachian community in Southern Ohio. Opened in 2005, the 27,000-square-foot business incubator and training facility is recognized as a community leader in economic development, business training, and technological excellence. The area served by the incubator is predominately rural and has been significantly impacted by the loss of industry while struggling to develop new opportunities for residents. Over the course of its first decade of operation, the Endeavor Center has helped local businesses create more than 2,500 jobs and retain 10,000 more, adding almost $200 million of direct economic activity to the local community. The community and university share responsibility for the direction and vision of the Endeavor Center through the Endeavor Center Council, a group of private and public sector partners. Guidance from the Council allows the university to understand the region’s changing economic conditions and adjust to the needs of local businesses.  http://southcenters.osu.edu/endeavor-center  

The Making a Difference Program is a community-engaged project designed to address health disparities in the Near East Side. The program implements health and wellness activities with community residents in prevention and self-management of their health, while creating enhanced experiential learning for nursing students, and research opportunities for faculty and graduate students. The program also helps build community capacity through skill development and funding community-initiated projects. Impact Faculty and students volunteer at the Ask a Buckeye Nurse Forums, a health initiative that provides free health screenings and education, conducted biweekly at a local barbershop. Community grants provide seed money for community initiated health-based programs for Near East Side residents.

A task force was developed to enhance engagement and develop recommendations for priorities, cost, timelines, and implementation of UB 2020 engagement goals.  The complete engagement report can be found online: http://www.buffalo.edu/content/www/ub2020/realizing-ub-2020/task-forces/_jcr_content/par/download_2/file.res/EngagementTaskForceFinalReport.pdf ","UB Community Relations works to connect community stakeholders with available university resources.  Community Relations regularly sends representation to block club meetings, dinners, banquets and general events (neighborhood clean ups, block parties, etc.).  Spending the time to cultivate these individual relationships has been critical in establishing trust in the urban neighborhoods surrounding UB's three campuses and has created an easily identifiable way for the university to authentically engage with the community at large.","The University at Buffalo consistently and systematically engages local, state and national agencies.  A sample of community stakeholders includes: University Heights Collaborative, Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, local elected officials, NYS Assembly and Senate members, elected federal officials, local chambers of commerce, local industrial development agencies, World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara, Buffalo Urban League, Buffalo Building Trades, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, United Way, NAACP of Buffalo Niagara, Western New York Environmental Alliance. ","UB 2020 has allowed UB to become a catalyst for regional economic development.  

UB's Regional Institute recently served as the Regional Sustainability Team coordinating the research, planning, community engagement and technical analysis for One Region Forward (1RF).  1RF is a broad-based collaborative effort to promote more sustainable forms of development in Erie & Niagara counties- the Buffalo Niagara Region- in land use, transportation, housing, energy and climate, access to food, and more.  1RF combines research and public engagement with planning and action to help meet the combined economic, environmental, and social challenges of the 21st century.  1RF is a Regional Plan for Sustainable Development, a federally recognized document that will give our region priority status for funding opportunities today and into the future.  1RF was made possible by the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning program from the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 

In February 2015, after nearly three years of research, community engagement, partnership building and planning by over 5,000 citizens and more than 700 local organizations, One Region Forward released its Regional Plan for Sustainable Development entitled “A New Way to Plan for Buffalo Niagara” ",http://www.oneregionforward.org/,--

University of British Columbia,2016-02-22,2016-02-22 18:18:46,charlene.ponto@ubc.ca,2.0,Pursuing,True,"UBC is committed to working with community stakeholders to ensure the University and its campuses are planned, built, operated, and made accessible in a way that reflects community interests and needs. 

UBC’s strategic plan, Place and Promise (http://strategicplan.ubc.ca/), provides the foundation for the University’s commitment to community stakeholder engagement. Community Engagement, Aboriginal Engagement, and Sustainability are pillars of Place and Promise. Amongst other goals in its strategic plan, UBC is committed to being a leader in fostering public understanding of societal issues and in stimulating action for positive change (Community Engagement), increasing engagement and strengthening mutually supportive and productive relationships with Aboriginal communities (Aboriginal Engagement), and in making UBC a living laboratory in environmental and social sustainability by integrating research, learning, operations, and industrial and community partners (Sustainability). UBC is intrinsically connected to and a part of numerous external communities. Established structures and practices ensure community stakeholder engagement is applied across UBC’s activities.

UBC has policies and guidelines for planning, strategic, and operational decisions that emphasize community stakeholder engagement and collaboration. For example, the UBC Vancouver Campus Plan provides a cohesive framework for the campus’ current and future development and was developed through a six-phase, comprehensive, inclusive, and engaging consultative process with students, residents, alumni, and other stakeholders. UBC’s Engagement Principles and Guiding Practices (http://planning.ubc.ca/vancouver/projects-consultations/consultations-engagement/ccp-engagement-principles), approved by the Board of Governors in Fall 2014, includes a set of principles for defining, designing, implementing and concluding public engagement for campus and community planning. 

Cross-campus initiatives also routinely bring together university and community stakeholders. The Campus as a Living Laboratory initiative integrates UBC faculty, staff, and students with external private, public, and NGO partners to make decisions and collaborate on how to use the University’s physical infrastructure to test, study, teach, apply, and share lessons learned, technologies created, and policies developed. 

UBC’s participation at stakeholder tables provides direct connection to several stakeholder groups. This includes UBC’s ongoing participation as contributing member to national and regional educational associations, as well as relationships with neighbouring communities and involvement on the boards of numerous community-based organizations. 

The Board of Governors’ People, Community and International Committee (http://bog.ubc.ca/?page_id=169)  holds responsibility for promoting, securing, and maintaining relationships with the many external communities on and off campus and internationally. It is also common practice at UBC for administrative units, faculties, and programs to have external advisory committees that provide ongoing input on decisions that impact community. Examples of Advisory Committees on campus that include community stakeholders include UBC’s Land Use Committee, Advisory Committee to VP Communications and Community Partnership, UBC Sustainability Initiative Steering Committee, Faculty of Education Dean’s Advisory Committee, Faculty of Law Dean’s Advisory Committee, IK Barber Learning Centre’s Advisory Committee on Community Engagement, Community Advisory Board to the Doctor, Patient and Society program in Faculty of Medicine.
","At UBC, many offices and units across campus are responsible for engaging different community stakeholder groups: 

COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS

CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY PLANNING
http://planning.ubc.ca/vancouver/projects-consultations/consultations-engagement
UBC’s Campus and Community Planning (C+CP) department is responsible for long-range land use planning, land use regulations, campus and landscape design, licensing and permits, managing programs that cover sustainability initiatives to transportation, and community-building activities.

C+CP is committed to engaging the campus community and its neighbours in the planning and design of UBC’s academic campus and neighbourhoods to create two-way communication, informed participation, and a culture of collaboration, both during planning processes and on an ongoing basis. A range of approaches are used to engage with the campus community and its neighbours, from informing, consulting, joint problem solving, and collaborating through to partnership, depending on the mandate, impact, and interest of planning processes. 

C+CP also chairs a committee that is comprised of organizations and individuals from UBC and also includes representatives of neighbouring communities and interests. The role of this committee is to provide advice and input to the Associate Vice President, C+CP, on the general implementation of plans and to allow for information sharing among the various members of the committee. The committee meets twice a year to provide a regular forum for representatives of neighbouring communities to receive and discuss information regarding the implementation of the Land Use Plan for the UBC Campus.

In addition to the above mentioned central administrative units, individual faculties, departments, and faculty members initiate and run their own community stakeholder engagement activities, including industry advisory committees, community service learning projects, outreach, and much more.","Community stakeholders include:

EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC), U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities, Research Universities’ Council of British Columbia (RUCBC), British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer, Confederation of University Faculty Associations of BC, Canadian Alliance of Student Associations.

CAMPUS RESIDENTS AND NEIGHBOURS
University Endowment Lands, University Neighbourhoods Association, West Point Grey, Dunbar Village, Parent Advisory Councils from the elementary and secondary schools in the area, Pacific Spirit Park Society, and Wreck Beach Preservation Society.","There are a myriad of examples to draw on from across the University. The following are samples of outcomes from specific initiatives that occurred during this STARS reporting period:

CAMPUS SHUTTLE ROUTE CHANGES
In 2012, UBC worked with TransLink (regional transportation authority) and the broader community to make improvements to the existing community shuttle service on campus. A collaborative process was used to identify how to enhance the campus community shuttle services, with the goal of increasing ridership and improving connections. UBC and TransLink identified two alternative routes to better connect UBC neighbourhoods and amenities. 

Public consultation was integral to ensuring that a new campus shuttle route would meet the needs of the campus community and neighbours. The public was offered both online and in-person opportunities to provide feedback on the proposed shuttle route changes. 975 questionnaires were taken and 15 letters of submission were received. Input was received from students, staff, faculty, residents, and stakeholders who live on campus, in UBC neighbourhoods, and neighbouring areas as well across the region. The feedback received provided insight into the level of support for the proposed route options, along with suggestions on bus stop locations. 

As of December 2013, two new shuttle routes were created to replace and improve the existing service. The process used to improve the shuttle service was viewed as a success for several reasons: 1) There was a large response rate, with broad representation from the campus community and neighbours; 2) The shuttle routes were adjusted based on the feedback received from the consultation; 3) It was a successful collaboration between UBC, TransLink, the campus community and neighbours; and 4) There is ongoing positive feedback on the new route, particularly from students.

THE CANADA FIRST RESEARCH EXCELLENCE FUND
In 2013/14, UBC helped formulate and successfully advocated for a new, major source of university research funding in Canada. Working closely with university sector organizations, other Canadian research-intensive universities, and federal government departments, UBC’s efforts helped establish the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, a $1.5 billion, 10-year commitment to propel areas of research strength at Canadian institutions to global prominence while creating long-term economic advantages for Canada. Units at UBC (President’s Office, Government Relations, VP Research and Innovation) responsible for this effort were a part of national collaboration efforts between post-secondary institutions and organizing bodies.

We provide leadership in diversity education training, equity initiatives and campus community engagement. We serve the campus and the greater community by working in collaboration with a broad cross section of the campus community to develop a strategic plan to guide the University in the development and assessment of policy, programs, initiatives and outreach efforts to increase diversity, improve campus climate and build a more inclusive community.

Campus Community Engagement: We facilitate partnerships between the University and diverse community groups (civic, business, educational, religious, cultural, etc.) that have not heretofore had well-developed relationships with our campus. By promoting a welcoming environment to advance the standing of UC Davis in the region, significant opportunity in the areas of student admission, employment and vendor contracts are afforded to individuals and businesses alike.

Principles of Community (A Statement of Values): UC Davis is a diverse community composed of individuals having many perspectives and abilities, of many faiths, cultures, ethnicities, races and orientations. We come from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, with distinct needs and goals. We recognize that to create an inclusive and intellectual vibrant community, we must understand and value both our individual differences and our common ground. The UC Davis Principles embody this commitment and the ideals to which we aspire (http://occr.ucdavis.edu/poc).
","The Reservation for College Community Program (RCCP) is designed to address the Academic Achievement Gap that persist between African-American and Latino students and their White student counterparts in K-12 public schools. It gives the higher education segment of our educational system a more vibrant and active role to play in increasing the number of African Americans and Latino students who successfully complete the A-G Curriculum and are thus eligible to enter a four year college or university (University of California eligible) upon completion of high school, rather than assuming the more passive role of simply waiting for the low numbers (“slow drip”) of these students who eventually make it through the K-12 pipeline. The RCCP is a collaborative effort between UC Davis (OCCR) and a consortium of key community individuals, organizations, busine3ss leaders, NGOs and elected officials pooling our resources with the objective of lessening the current Academic Achievement Gap. The RCCP has many components, most of which are currently in early development but includes a Student Parent Academic Resource Program; Academic Enrichment and Outreach Activities; Professional Development Workshops for Teachers; A Virtual Online Classroom; Tutoring/Mentoring Activities;  Scholarship and Internship Opportunities; Academic Counseling and more. The program focuses on providing support for both the student and their family utilizing a holistic approach to educating and uplifting the entire family unit (including parent job training, health/nutritional education and housing counseling). The underlying theme of the initiative is to uplift and move an entire family forward rather than simply focusing on the child and “mining “(extracting ) them out of their family unit for a selective higher educational experience. The goal is for both the child and family to gain exposure to opportunities for success.","B.R.A.V.E.

SUN is a coalition made up of community groups, including Citizen's Planning Association (CPA), the Coalition for Sustainable Transportation (COAST), the Santa Barbara League of Women Voters, the Santa Barbara County Action Network (SBCAN), the SBCAN Action Fund, and the Santa Barbara Audubon Society.
The agreement sets forth methods for active engagement of SUN in the Campus's planning and development efforts, capital investment projects, and other decisions that affect the larger community through the following forms of support/representation: 
a. The appointment of a SUN-designated community organization (ex officio) representative to the Campus Sustainability Committee;
b. The appointment of SUN-designated community organization (ex officio) representatives to Campus-Wide Sustainability Change Agent committees;
c. The appointment of a SUN-designated community organization representative to serve as an ex-officio member of TAB; and
d. The appointment of a SUN-designated community organization representative to serve as an ex-officio member of the Parking Ratepayers Board.
UCSB does not have any established policies with which to identify stakeholders; however, any community group can join SUN if they feel that they are not being engaged and or are under-represented.  
","UCSB’s is very active in engaging our stakeholders, especially within Housing & Residential services. We engage them in our planning in almost every area, but particularly in the area of student housing and dining facilities.
For example, we have held many design charrettes over the past 4 years, engaging students in our efforts to fine tune programming needs before we build the San Joaquin Apartments on the Santa Catalina site.
In addition, we are currently running an MTD/Housing partnership survey of students to find ways to improve bus service to existing residents, as well as to prepare for over 1500 new students coming with the Sierra Madre (515) and San Joaquin (1000) projects.
Here is the draft site underway for the bus survey – https://info.housing.ucsb.edu/mtd_bus_survey.aspx 
We are also engaged with homeowners associations and the City of Goleta.  Our Director of Residential & Community Living, Jill Hurd, along with our Community Housing officer Roane Akchurin, has been attending the IV Homeowners Association to talk about the campus's housing projects. The Storke Ranch Homeowners Association has been invited via their property management company Bartlein as well as by individual postcard invitations to our various design charrettes in the past and has had a strong presence for the past few years in the process.  The local homeowners (at Storke Ranch and north of the Sierra Madre project) are currently engaged in our San Joaquin EIR review with the Coastal Commission, coordinated by the Planning office. 
 As part of many daylong meetings with our architects and consultants, the City of Goleta has been engaged in the same process; in fact, this group often has had their lunch meetings in the Santa Catalina conference rooms, along with the county and COAST safe routes to school groups, as well as the principal of IV school.

This is a coalition of stakeholders including City of Boulder, the University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder County Public Health, Boulder Valley School District, Boulder Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Responsible Hospitality Group, neighborhood representatives, parents, property managers and CU students. The purpose of the groups is address problems related to high-risk consumption of alcohol; and work as a collective coalition to create strategies to address these problems, both as they relate to each stakeholder group's area of influence/ responsibility, and as a collective community. In the case of alcohol-induced challenges in local neighborhoods, the neighbors themselves are considered vulnerable stakeholders.

-Operational, planning and capital improvements also avail of broad stakeholder engagement during the planning process. For instance, the City and CU routinely coordinate stakeholder input into the Transportation Improvement Planning process as follows: City staff requests project ideas from various city departments and partner agencies including CU. Initial project ideas are evaluated and developed as concepts, public input is sought, and revised ideas are presented to the Transportation Advisory Board (TAB) during a public hearing. The TAB analyzes the potential projects and approves a list of projects for further development. City staff develops conceptual designs and cost estimates for each of the proposed projects. The TAB hosts another public hearing and then recommends a set of projects to City Council for submission to the DRCOG. City staff presents the proposed projects and the TAB recommendation to City Council at a public hearing.

Many other stakeholder outreach and engagement efforts ate detailed at:
http://outreach.colorado.edu/programs/search/page/1?keyword=&topics%5B%5D=38
","Under-represented groups are engaged in ongoing CU discussions through a variety of outreach efforts. CU's SORCE efforts are external and internal in an effort to engage under-represented groups from metro K-12 schools in conversations about race, diversity, education, community betterment and attracting local represented students to CU. http://www.colorado.edu/SORCE/outreach.html

Other vulnerable and under-represented stakeholders include local youth from all backgrounds whose futures depend on articulating their needs and having them supported. To that end an NGO, Growing Up Boulder. is supported by CU in an effort to actively engage youth in a number of planning and design projects to increase youth voice. In 2013 GUB signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the City of Boulder, University of Colorado, and Boulder Valley School District that creates a framework for Growing Up Boulder’s continued collaboration in community engagement and enrichment.

This pillar is actuated by UH's many community projects, partnerships, camps, and other efforts detailed in the following sections. Furthermore, The University of Houston System Office of Governmental Relations coordinates the efforts of the four UHS universities to work with elected officials, administrative agencies and community organizations to advance both the priorities of the system and the surrounding community. Emphasizing an engaged and comprehensive approach, the office focuses on establishing collaborative partnerships within the community, implementing a proactive external affairs program and maintaining mutually productive relationships with community stakeholders. ","In the past, the University of Houston engaged the community at large through a ""needs based"" strategy. Partnering with Houston City government and even having a permanent Government Relations Office in the state capital, university representatives have served as an ""ear to the ground"" during house sessions and other political events to learn how to best serve their community. This strategy resulted in university community engagement occurring all over Houston and even the state. However, in recent years, the University of Houston has adopted a commitment to to serve our immediate surrounding community (7- to 8-mile radius). This radius encompasses the Greater Third Ward, an area of high poverty, mostly populated by underrepresented groups; some reports listing a 99% poverty level demographic. Given the high need for community support, UH students, faculty and staff conduct various projects and camps to help serve the community.

","The Third Annal Mayor's Back to School Fest impacted 13,000 students and their families by supplying school supplies, backpacks, city information, health screenings, immunizations, and social service resources. 

Once again working in conjunction with the City of Houston, the University of Houston participated in several citywide as well as on-campus events helping support the city’s Citizenship Month initiative. Citizenship Month is a series of community driven events and programs designed to raise awareness of the diversity, cultural experience and citizenry of Houston. The Office of Community and Government Relations took on the role as direct liaison with city officials and attended city-wide events including the luncheon to help launch this year’s initiative. We also worked together with our Student Affairs Division to confirm our student events on campus were recognized as part Citizenship Month and were able to secure an interview for the Daily Cougar with Houston’s First Lady Kathy Hubbard who chairs this cause. 

The Office of Community and Government Relations spearheaded a UH Day of Giving at the Houston Food Bank. The goal of this project was to offer UH faculty, staff and students a unified opportunity to volunteer their time for a worthy cause. Our goal was to bring together as many UH volunteers as possible in one location. Initially our goal was to host 100 volunteers, but the momentum surrounding this event turned into over 200 of our own representing our Cougar pride in the community. 

For the 2014 March of Dimes March for Babies campaign, the office of Governmental and Community Relations officially took over the role as UH administrator and liaison with the March of Dimes Houston Chapter, a role previously held by the Division of Student Affairs. During this time our office worked closely with March of Dimes officials as well as on campus personnel such as parking and police overseeing logistics for hosting this event on campus.  As part of the official university liaison, our offices took on the responsibility of attending a number of city-wide events and meetings related to the March of Dimes. Houston hosts the largest March of Dimes walk in the nation. Hosting this event on our campus brings together a number of corporate sponsors, community stakeholders vested in the March of Dimes cause. 

In addition to working closely with March of Dimes organizers, our offices also spearheaded the University of Houston fundraising campaign for the March for Babies. Through our offices we worked closely with department team captains ensuring they have all fundraising details and materials readily available. The campaign runs from January through June and leadership and direction for our efforts are managed through our office during this entire time. In preparation for this campaign our offices hosted a kick-off luncheon specifically for our UH team captains as a way to rally their efforts and help prepare them for the campaign ahead. Our office also maintains direct communication with team captains and the University as a whole to encourage walkers and participation in the walk. 

This year we added a new element to our tent by welcoming the UH College of Pharmacy who provided over 450 glucose and blood pressure screenings to walkers. This resource allowed participants a quick and easy health screening opportunity as well as a means to showcase the work of our students. UH Pharmacy students also included the use of the “Mega Heart,” an inflatable educational exhibit that allows guest to walk through and learn about the different components of the human heart. The “Mega Heart” was visited by over 3,000 patrons at the March of Dimes Walk. This is a component we will welcome back for next year’s event. Pharmacy students benefit by helping serve the community as part of their field of study and to help prepare them for their career ahead. 

In celebration of the life of work of activist Cesar Chavez, the Houston Tejano Preservation Society hosted the Cesar Chavez Parade in Houston’s Historic East End.  Our office partnered up with a proud alum and owner of a spirited UH van that was used as an entry in the parade. The festive four-wheeler machine provided a spectacular presence of Cougar pride and support to our neighbors in the East End.

Working in conjunction with the UH LGBT Resource Center, our offices participated in the 34th Annual Pride Parade, showcasing our Cougar support to the over 70,000 people in attendance at this year’s parade. Pride Houston is one of the city’s largest parades that includes over 160 individual entries consisting of large corporations such as Chase Bank, Shell Oil and Center Point Energy just to name a few. Other entries include non-profit organizations, various elected officials and a number of higher education institutions within the city including Rice University, Houston Community College and Lone Star Community College. Members from the UH LGBT alumni group as well as current students participated in this event. Having our float provided a increased UH representation in a celebrated Houston event.

Stakeholders participate in a variety of ways.  Many academic units, including the UIC Urban Health program have advisory committees and alumni groups that offer opportunities for input from stakeholders.  For example, the Office of Development most likely consults with major donors to the University regarding fundraising campaigns. Stakeholders such as the Mayor, influential alumni and donors have a  great impact on policy and practice at UIC.

 Stakeholder engagement occurs at UIC, but not necessarily in the terms of engagement in governance.    The Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement, under the College of Urban Planning & Public Affairs, focuses in transforming democracy by creating a more fully engaged citizenry with more effective leaders.  The Institute creates opportunities for scholars, concerned citizens, students and government officials to actively participate in social discourse, research and educational programs on policy issues and social trends. ","The Office of Community Relations is an office within the Office of the Vice Chancellor for External Affairs.  The Office of the Vice Chancellor for External Affairs works to build and maintain relationships between UIC and its neighboring communities.  The office works with local civic, corporate, and community organizations, and with alumni and internal constituents. The Office of Community Relations works to actively engage all of its units in heaping UIC attain recognition as a leading urban based research institution.

The Adoption Mentoring Partnership is a collaboration between the Rudd Adoption Research Program in the psychological and brain sciences department at UMass Amherst and Big Brothers, Big Sisters of Hampshire County. The program seeks to match UMass students who are adopted with adopted children in the community. Matched across a variety of factors, the mentors and children are able to form friendships grounded in the similarities between them, such as gender, race, ethnicity and adoption story. By providing a same-gender, same-race mentor for adopted children, the mentors become not only friends, but role models as well.

The Springfield/Holyoke Health Alliance for Research and Engagement (SHHARE) builds linkages among Public Health and Health Sciences faculty, students and community, applying principles of community-based participatory research to enhance joint efforts to solve pressing health problems in Holyoke and Springfield. Forums in Holyoke and Springfield have highlighted the work of community members, including the Holyoke Food and Fitness Policy Council, Gardening the Community, and Men of Color Health Awareness. SHHARE has also created a Who’s Who in Public Health in Western Massachusetts database, and has funded numerous internships in community health organizations.

The Himalayan Climate Change Adaptation Programme provides design/build services to Kumik, a village in the Indian Himalayas, where chronic drought caused by climate change is forcing an entire community to move to a new site. Faculty work with villagers to help envision this process and plan with digital tools. Planning and design solutions will conserve scarce water, harness the region’s abundant solar energy, incorporate local materials and building wisdom, and generate much-needed income, as well as opportunities for improving the health, energy-efficiency and economic conditions.

The Center for Women & Community for 30 years has provided free general and trauma-based counseling and information and referral services for all Hampshire County residents. Services include online and in-person information and referral services; empowerment-based short-term counseling, support groups and referrals; support services for survivors of sexual assault; a 24-hour crisis hotline; access to medical and legal advocacy; peer counseling in Spanish and English; specialized services for teens and the Latino community; academic and social service advocacy, and outreach services in schools and community organization in Spanish and English.

UMass Lowell 2020: A Strategic Plan for the Next Decade, was adopted in 2009 and developed over 18 months by more than 200 faculty, staff and students, with feedback from the entire campus as well as an external advisory group comprised of alumni and community leaders.  The University is guided by its strategic plan which includes the following goals:

•	Embrace “Partnerships and Engagement” as a central theme of academic and scholarly activity at UMass Lowell by:
- Creating a University climate and environment that welcomes partners to campus and demonstrates the value the University places on partnerships and engagement.
-  Cataloging, promoting and facilitating existing and future partnerships among the University, the city of Lowell and our numerous Lowell-based partners.

•	Utilize the varied talents and disciplines of the University community to foster economic development across the region and the state by:
- Identify teaching and research strengths of the University and align them with the needs of the region’s economy, which can be understood by engaging in regional development dialogue and initiatives.
- Support consulting, research and exchange programs for faculty and service-learning and internship opportunities for students that enhance university-community partnerships.

These goals and objectives cannot be met without community stakeholder engagement which underpins decisions made by the University at all levels.

","In addition to the above, the Office of Community Relations meets regularly with four local neighborhood groups: the Acre Coalition To Improve Our Neighborhood; the East Pawtucketville Citizens Group; the Lowell Downtown Neighborhood Association; and the Pawtucketville Citizens Council. These groups share neighborhoods that the university borders, and we have a shared interest in improvements related to public safety and curb appeal. As a result of our partnership, we have also collaborated on initiatives such as neighborhood cleanups, tours on campus and/or within neighborhoods, and festivals.

Another significant development has been the formalization of UMass Lowell’s connection to the Learning in Retirement Association (LIRA). The University and LIRA have been partners for 28 years. In 2013, the Office of Alumni Relations and Office of Community Relations executed an agreement with LIRA to manage the group’s funds and assist with program development and membership recruitment. LIRA each year serves some 130 elders with educational programs designed and largely taught by LIRA members; UMass Lowell professors augment the teaching corps on a volunteer basis. The University subsidizes the cost of learning space for LIRA and provides venues for the annual Convocation, Town Meeting, and Holiday Gathering. LIRA in return provides two $1000 scholarships for UMass Lowell students each year. Since its establishment by the University’s former Community Service Office, LIRA has donated some $50,000 in scholarship money to University students. Members also organize service activities such as collecting winter clothing for children in need.

The purpose of the MOU is to provide a cooperative framework for renewed commitment and partnership between UMKC and the Board that “empowers the Hispanic community to attain educational excellence and to contribute positively to the fulfillment of the mission of UMKC.” The MOU focuses on a number of strategies, including increasing recruitment/admission of and financial assistance for students from underrepresented minority groups; increasing numbers of minority faculty and staff; and increasing efforts toward recruitment, retention, promotion and award of tenure of underrepresented minority faculty and staff. ","UMKC continues to engage the following neighborhoods through monthly meeting and ongoing discussions regarding planning, construction, community events and other activities.  The neighborhood eneaged by UMKC include but are not limited to the 43/63 Neighborhood, the
Volker Neighborhood, the
Rockhill Neighborhood and the Crestwood Neighborhood
UMKC also continues to engage a wide range of diverse organizations within the local community that include but are not limited to the following: the Mattie Rhodes Center, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Foundation, and the Black Community Partners Advisory Board in addressing community issues, education access, etc. ongoing.

University of Mount Union,2016-01-13,2016-01-13 13:05:40,mcclauca@mountunion.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The University of Mount Union uses and aligns the efforts of three key planning processes: the Strategic Plan, the Campus Master Plan and the Five-Year Operating Plan, which are informed at every level by input from faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders. The Imagine Mount Union Steering Committee oversees the planning of continuous improvements within the institution. 

The AQIP Steering Committee was established to guide and monitor the activities and responsibilities of the AQIP accrediting system for the institutional accreditation process through the Higher Learning Commission. The committee is composed of six faculty members, six staff members, the president of Student Senate and a liaison identified by the president. 


For prospective students, the University gathers data about needs through ACT/SAT data, individual prospective student visit survey data, the Entering Freshman Survey, Office of Admission program offerings and satisfaction surveys of the summer new student orientation programs. 

For current students, the University gathers data about needs through feedback from campus committees, feedback from residence hall activities, career development surveys, student organization advising, exit interviews for students withdrawing from the institution, My First Year in College Survey, the CORE alcohol/drug survey and the Student Satisfaction Survey. 

Survey data provides the offices of Alumni Relations and University Activities and Advancement with the levels of satisfaction held by the parents of new and current students. 

The Office of Alumni Relations and University Activities employs results of stakeholder data collected during the strategic planning process to guide the Executive Board of the Alumni Council in selecting and evaluating progress for annual action items. This group of 12 alumni leads efforts to actively engage and connect alumni in the life of the University in ways that are meaningful for alumni while supporting key objectives of the Strategic Plan. 

Mount Union addresses changing needs of key stakeholder groups through the strategic planning process and updates information regularly by collecting stakeholder information. Data gathered are analyzed in planning sessions and utilized by the offices on campus with direct responsibility for relationship building with the stakeholders. 

Mount Union builds and maintains relationships through formal and informal interactions, striving to provide accurate information while both listening and responding to stakeholders’ needs. The University relies on faculty and staff to respond constructively and helpfully in thousands of interactions daily with key stakeholders. 
","The internal and external environment analysis conducted during the strategic planning process revealed areas of greatest leverage for the University, using a rigorous feasibility process that includes the likelihood of involvement by new student and stakeholder groups. Information is gleaned from national surveys of student groups entering college, regular analysis of regional demographics and the impact on future enrollments, watching trends in the marketplace and regular augmentation of new student orientation programming. 

Social media outlets have become an integral part of marketing efforts and are used to engage and converse with stakeholders, particularly students. The Office of Marketing has created a number of communication plans that outline the means and frequency of the institution’s communication with each recognized stakeholder group. For example, parents of current students, as represented by the respondent pool for parent data collection, want periodic information from Mount Union on two topics: academic support and career development services.

•	Students and prospective students
•	Families/Parents of students

Goals for the year include the budget number of 625 and the admission target of at least 675 students.

","Stakeholders are identified based on their proximity to or expressed interest in any given project.

","Neighbors, local government bodies, utility providers, chamber of commerce and member businesses, Chapel Hill Downtown Partnership, K-12 schools, community leaders and representatives, non-profit organizations.","The UNC Foundation purchased an outdated retail shopping center across the street from a new mixed use, town supported development on the main commercial corridor in Chapel Hill and adjacent to campus. Many planning meetings were hosted by the UNC's Real Estate Development Office to solicit input and feedback from community stakeholders on the types and forms of development that were most needed and best suited to that location. . 

The Chapel Hill Downtown Partnership brings the resources of the Town, the University, and downtown community together to maintain, enhance and promote downtown as the social, cultural, and spiritual center of Chapel Hill through economic development. Facade improvement grants, branding and design work, promotional videos, cleanliness and safety initiatives, and business owner seminars are recent outcomes.

Bike master planning efforts on campus and in the Town of Chapel Hill employed the same consultant to achieve synergies and shared priorities in the planning process. Many of the planning meetings solicited input from community stakeholders to determine priority routes and preferred types of infrastructure.

Planning for the future, mixed use Carolina North campus included many community partners and briefings for local governments. One outcome was choosing the best location for a campus-to-campus bike route. Three routes were proposed and multiple town-gown meetings, that included a range of community stakeholders, were held to select the best route.

In addition, the UNCG Strategic Plan emphasizes Community Engagement in the following ways: promoting economic transformation, cultural expression, and community development.

As UNCG continues to expand its campus, future residential and student life facilities will
require new approaches to integrate them into the campus culture and community.
While there is no overarching university-wide policy that ensures community stakeholder engagement, many groups across campus do have such advisory boards.  
See below for examples:

Center for New North Carolinians
Center for Community Engaged Design
OLSL's Service-Learning Advisory Board 
OIC's Innovation Commercialization Advisory Network
ICEE's Excellence in Community Engagement Visioning and Planning Advisory Committee

Many departments have Alumni boards or community members who serve on accreditation boards, although we don't have this data offhand.","It accomplishes this by building on the extensive community outreach that resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Glenwood neighborhood as well as

These characteristics relate to the university's mission, leadership and internal structural elements, the cultural and innovative activities (research, educational opportunities, programs and engagement), the openness to accessibility and recognition and the understanding of the existence of reciprocal relationship between the university and external community, recognizing its contributions and perspective.
In several departments and areas at UNCW, the campus and the community meet regularly to discuss issues, priorities, and related assets; however, we strive to achieve an increased amount of coordination between the campus and community to leverage university assets to support and enhance these regional activities and to enhance the impact of the students' educational experience. Individual departments and areas on campus may have a process that involves community members in assessing and identifying local and regional needs that the campus can address.

The Office of Community Engagement has since connected a number of USC offices, programs and people to help enhance the University's engagement and service efforts.  The office has become our institutional spearhead in more clearly defining and articulating what community engagement is, what methods should be used in scholarly community engagement activities, and what constitutes appropriate recognition and professional development for those who commit to scholarly community engagement. Our University has come a long way in moving from individual entrepreneurship to interdisciplinary pursuits in many of our partnership and outreach activities.  The office of Community Engagement and other community engagement and service offices on our campus will continue to provide guidance and support in the cohesive efforts that will define our engagement and service pursuits.","The University describes community engagement as opportunities to partner with our various communities for the mutual benefit of both the University and the community.  This benefit typically involves a reciprocal exchange of knowledge and resources and leads to activities and initiatives that can address significant societal issues that ultimately contribute to the public good.  The types of community partners the we recognize in our data collection include:  community-based organizations, governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, faith-based groups, social organizations, and public or private schools.","The Office of Community Engagement currently captures community partnerships that were initiated and are maintained by faculty.

","During the summer of 2013, inspired by anti-poverty community activism in Tampa, a small group of USF faculty along with staff from the Office of Community Engagement and Partnerships (OCEP) began meeting to discuss ways that the University of South Florida could marshal more of its resources to address poverty and inequality in the Tampa Bay region. They asked, What are the challenges involved in poverty research and activism? How do we counter misinformation and misleading stereotypes about poverty? How can the university engage with the community in constructive dialogue about the causes, consequences, and best ways to alleviate poverty? In order to bring multidisciplinary perspectives to bear on these issues, the OCEP organized an on-campus forum that brought together two panels of USF researchers and educators to ponder these questions in the context of their own work studying poverty, inequality, and related problems in the areas of health, housing, employment, criminal justice, and education—the last with a focus on disparities in educational access by low-income children in poorly resourced schools.

In October 2013, Poverty and Inequality: A Forum on Research, Action, and Community Engagement succeeded in bringing together close to 50 USF faculty, staff, and students, in addition to 12 panelists and moderators. They discussed ways to begin a multidisciplinary research-to-action program at USF that engages non-profits, elected officials, public agencies, and community residents, as well as to establish resources for teaching, research, and community partnerships that are evidence-based and reflective of local history and circumstances. After a lively discussion involving panelists and audience, participants spoke of potential future collaborations, including new course construction or the development of action research projects. Many who attended expressed an eagerness to hold an off-campus poverty forum, co-hosted with community partners.",http://www.usf.edu/engagement/special-initiatives/poverty-inequality-and-community-engagement-initiative.aspx,--

University of Tennessee at Knoxville,2016-02-23,2016-02-23 11:20:37,prestonj@utk.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"UT’s Office of Community Engagement & Outreach (OCEO) is charged with advancing campus-wide coordination for community engagement. OCEO reports directly to UT’s vice chancellor for research and engagement and is advised by a Carnegie Advisory Committee that includes members of the external community along with UT faculty, staff, students and administrators. OCEO’s director represents UT on the national boards of the APLU’s Council on Engagement and Outreach and the Engagement Scholarship Consortium. 
OCEO works closely with  a number of other offices, including the dean of Extension, who co-chairs the Carnegie Advisory Committee and is an integral part of UT’s coordinating infrastructure for community engagement. 
An essential part of coordinating community engagement at UT is the deliberate establishment of interlacing communities and communities of practice that weave us together internally while connecting us to our external partners in a more coordinated way. Among these are the Chancellor’s Academic Outreach and Engagement Council, which includes faculty representation from all 11 colleges. Members work closely with the vice chancellor for research and engagement and the director of community engagement and outreach to develop policy, mentor faculty, serve on review committees, liaise with the Faculty Senate and continue their own engaged scholarship.","UT has incorporated numerous mechanisms to ensure the input and feedback of partners in the planning, assessment and improvement cycles at an institutional level. In addition to advisory boards at institutional and unit levels, mechanisms that systematically assess community perceptions of the campus-level mission and strategic plan for community engagement involve an array of tools that are often created and deployed at the unit or department level. We often find unit level mechanisms to be the most useful, as they work where relationships are the most direct. Seven of these mechanisms are included in this response. 

(1) UT’s Board of Trustees has a Research, Outreach and Economic Development Committee responsible for assessing programs.
(2) A permanent Carnegie Community Engagement Advisory Committee consists of UT administrators, faculty, students and representatives of the external community. The committee uses a structured method for group brainstorming that includes problem identification, solution generation, and decision making, for ongoing assessment of community perceptions of UT’s engagement efforts. 
(3) Six hundred plus members of UT Extension’s 95 county advisory committees help develop programs, curricula, partnerships and resources for assessing and addressing community concerns. An award-winning, custom-built software program tracks Extension's needs and assessment efforts across Tennessee. It is being used as a model for ongoing development of assessment software for use on the rest of the UT campus. 
(4) Within UT’s Institute for Public Service, the Municipal Technical Advisory Service, County Technical Assistance Service, Center for Industrial Services and Law Enforcement Innovation Center each assess community perceptions through quarterly advisory board meetings and biennial community surveys. 
(5) The Center for Leadership and Service (CLS) annually surveys more than 100 partner organizations to determine perceptions of overall university engagement and efforts of individual students with whom they have worked. CLS’s collection of and response to these data are also valuable at an institutional level because these partners often engage with other units and colleges across campus. 
(6) UT’s service-learning courses formally identified by the “S” course designation in the course catalog and on student transcripts include a web-based process of assessing community perceptions as an integral part of course designation and evaluation. 
(7) UT’s new Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity holds listening sessions with diverse external communities to inform an inaugural set of programs and infrastructure. A session held in October 2013 with members of Knoxville’s Latino/Hispanic community focused on such questions as: “How is UT viewed in the Latino/Hispanic community?” “How is the UT community engaged with the Latino/Hispanic community?” and “How would you like to see UT engaged with the community?” ","American Cancer Society

Knoxville Homeless Management Information System Program: In  2012, there were 9,388 active clients in Knox County, 4% more than 2011. KnoxHMIS data has shown that, contrary to common local belief, the majority (78%) do not arrive from elsewhere but come from the local area. KnoxHMIS's vast data set has led to better services delivery & outcomes reporting. The data suggest that Homeless Prevention and Rapid Rehousing programs have been extremely successful in preventing homelessness for at risk individuals and families, and in quickly placing those who have become homeless back in permanent housing. Since 2009, an average of 91% of clients served are in permanent homes when they exit the programs.

Community Full-Service Schools Program: Community Impact included the provision of health services to students and their families; mental health screenings; academic support for students and their families; and financial support for the families. At-risk urban students at five schools thus far are enabled to create long-term, mentoring relationships with UT students and faculty based on the three tenants of prevention, collaboration, and systems-level thinking.

The University of Winnipeg Community Renewal Corporation (“UWCRC”) is a not-for-profit charitable corporation, created to support the University by developing a sustainable University community. Half of its 16 member Board is drawn from the University community, including the President, who serves as chair. The other half is drawn from the community, including neighbourhood organizations, developers and development professionals.  UWCRC is a non-share capital, charitable corporation whose mandate is to support the University of Winnipeg by developing a sustainable University community. Its members are those persons appointed or elected from time to time as the Directors of the corporation. The University’s intention to create UWCRC as its development arm is reflected in a resolution of the University Board of Regents.   UWCRC’s by law provides that the Directors shall be the President of The University of Winnipeg, seven persons appointed by the President (in consultation with the University’s Board Chair), and 8 other persons elected out of “community organizations, the business and professional community, and the community at large”.   The 8 community representatives are elected each year at the annual general meeting.  A Board nominating committee recommends a slate of candidates for consideration by the members and an election is held.  The 7 Presidential appointments must include a representative from the Board of Regents, a representative from the University of Winnipeg Foundation Board, a senior administrator or faculty member, and a representative appointed by the University of Winnipeg Students' Association.

The Indigenous Advisory Circle meetings are held three times annually and the Circle advises the President and Vice-Chancellor, the Associate Vice-President Indigenous, Government and Community Affairs, Senior Administrators, and the University community. The Advisory Circle’s membership represents urban, rural and northern Indigenous peoples in Canada as well as other international Indigenous communities. Members have expertise and experience in a range of areas, but particularly in education and development.

The University's Community Learning Policy provides an institutional framework for the management and support of community learning activities, with a view to increase access to and participation in post-secondary education for those who are traditionally underrepresented in the University population, with a focus on Indigenous people and new Canadians.  Community Learning refers to the active integration of the University into the social, cultural, and educational life of the community.

","A Presidential Search Committee was established in 2012 to serve in an advisory capacity to the Board Officers, whose role and responsibility was to select and recommend the next President and Vice-Chancellor to the Board of Regents.  The committee included representations from collective bargaining units, students, faculty, staff, and the Indigenous Advisory Circle.  http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/presidential-selection-committee.  The search process also included a number of university community consultations with various stakeholder groups.

In developing the Unviersity's new RecPlex, extensive consultations were held with external stakeholders to develop a framework for community access to the new facility.  A unique coalition of 18 youth-serving agencies – the Youth Agencies Alliance – offered input and advice as the new RecPlex took shape. http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/recplex-history",--,--

The University meets with the City to review their utilities infrastructure as well as any city codes, zoning or other considerations with any renovations or upgrades to the grounds or buildings. Most projects also go through the City's Plan Review process. Also, depending upon what item being dealt with a project may also go through a planned development review or a conditional use review process. All events which use City of Oshkosh streets by either blocking them or larger traffic impact are sent from the Dean of Students Office to the City for review and any necessary approvals.

In addition to these meetings the University as a UW System school performs environmental impact assessments (EIA) for the majority of our construction and remodeling projects with the involvement of the surrounding community. An initial Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act (WEPA) Evaluation is completed and a determination is made as to whether an EIA or an environmental impact statement (EIS) process is necessary to be completed.

Description: Evaluation form for the Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act (WEPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as it relates to proposed campus physical development. Includes 14 points of assessment related to environmental impacts and alternatives, archeological and historical sites, energy impacts, economic impacts, long-range plan and policy impacts, and precedents.

Purpose: Records preliminary investigation and evaluation of potential environmental impact significance and conditional determination of Type I/II/III action requirements.
","Education and governmental leaders regularly meet as a community sounding board. Opportunity for review and discussion on various issues.

The University is extensively involved in outreach community development and economic development discussions through the chamber of commerce and the economic development corporation. Many social service and nonprofit community-based organizations have significant levels of university involvement and entanglement.

This is not to say that some departments work in conjunction with community stake holders. 

Although Continuing Education does not have a stakeholder engagement plan, we maintain communications with stakeholders in a variety of ways, depending on the stakeholder group. Some examples…
•	The Learning Is Forever (LIFE) program is a member-based program with a board of directors that assess needs and plans educational programs. Two CE staff participate on the board
•	Conference services work with conference committees from the sponsoring organizations
•	School districts are visited periodically to assess the needs and learning directions they are pursuing, and the programs we offer to their teachers are adapted to the district’s needs
•	Professionals in the field are consulted on an as needed basis to provide insights and directions for our offerings to non-traditional learners in those professions
•	Employers are involved with appropriate types of programs for their specific types of needs

The CPS has several formal external stakeholder groups (below).  
•	Business Advisory Council, consists of CEO’s/upper managers of large businesses in the region with representation from each of the major industries.  This group provides support and advice to our School of Business and Economics.
•	Corporate Partners, consists of upper managers and HR directors of many small to mid-size businesses.  Participation on this group is open to any business who has an interest in our School of Business and Economics.   
•	Clinical Lab Sciences advisory board. Consists of CLS clinicians from throughout Wisconsin that represent our clinical affiliates. This group provides support and advice to our CLS program.
•	Health Sciences Advisory Committee, consists of health care professionals from the region. This group provides advice and support to our health care professional programs.  
•	Dietetics Advisory Board,  consists of regional health care and public health officials.  This group provides advice and support to our Community Nutrition and Dietetics programs.  
•	North Central Wisconsin Higher Education Association (NCWHEA) Nursing Workgroup. Consists of program directors and advisors of 2 year and technical colleges in the region.  This group provides support and advice on our nursing completion program.

The Vice Provost for Community Engagement is on the provost's leadership team. In this role, Dr. Cathy Howard carries forward the mission of community engagement to her counterparts in academic and faculty affairs, student affairs and other units. Through DCE initiatives such as service learning, ASPiRE and Neighborhood Outreach, the university serves as a bridge that mobilizes university-community partnerships.
Under the DCE, Neighborhood Outreach works to build and strengthen relationships with the external community, specifically the five neighborhoods that surround VCU. The neighborhood outreach director meets regularly with a team of liaisons from the surrounding communities to discuss issues of common concern and to develop programs/events that enable students, staff/faculty and residents to work collaboratively to address community-identified needs.
The vice provost and neighborhood outreach director are consulted on issues that affect the community, including capital projects. Often, these issues require the university to meet with individuals and groups from the community. While this is not systematically implemented as a policy, it has become a part of the culture of the institution.
Annually, Dr. Michael Rao and other university leaders meet with community leaders to share VCU's developments over the past year and gather feedback from the community. VCU's report typically includes a brief State of the University, a capital plan progress report and a public safety report. The DCE follows up with community members and groups on any issues that may require further communication.","The Division of Community Engagement created the Neighborhood Team to discuss community issues and share information among units. The group, which includes VCU Police, Student Affairs, Fraternity & Sorority Life, Office of Student Conduct & Academic Integrity, and Residential Life & Housing, meets quarterly. Community members identified as neighborhood liaisons participate in two of the four meetings.
VCU Police created a position specifically to build relationships with community members and help address issues involving university students who live near VCU. The external affairs officer attends several neighborhood association meetings, provides updates and takes student-related complaints. He follows up with students, landlords and the community at subsequent meetings.","Neighborhood associations near VCU, including: Carver, Jackson Ward, The Fan, Randolph, Oregon Hill and Church Hill

Wartburg College,2015-04-27,2015-04-27 09:09:12,anne.duncan@wartburg.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Key to Wartburg College’s vitality is identifying people, companies, and foundations whose ongoing leadership, vision, and support can inform its strategic direction.  Formal framework for engagement occurs in many ways. Here we will identify and go in to detail on a few of the primary ways: 

National Advisory Boards (NAB) assist pre-determined College programs and departments in the process of evaluation and planning. National Advisory Boards will play an integral role in recommending ways to establish and meet institutional goals. This is achieved through the advice, advocacy, expertise, goodwill, and financial support of Advisory Board members. NABs will provide an avenue for alumni and friends from across the country to stay connected to the college and for enhanced communication between the college and its constituents. Nearly 300 alumni and friends of the college are involved in the NABs.

The President’s Advisory Council (PAC) includes about a dozen business and community leaders which are friends and alumni of the College who:
•  Share a commitment  to the College’s mission of “challenging and nurturing students for lives of leadership and service as a spirited expression of their faith and learning”;
•  Invest time, talent, and resources in helping the College to achieve its strategic goals;
•  Help to expand the College’s circle of friends, without bearing fund-raising obligations; and
•  Offer the president their best advice, unencumbered by fiduciary responsibility.

The Commission on Mission strategic planning process is detailed in the front section of our strategic plan, located at http://www.wartburg.edu/strategicplan/COM%20Strategic%20Plan_low.pdf. It involved many alumni and friends in envisioning the future for the college. 

The Transforming Tomorrow campaign seeks to raise funds to fulfill the goals in the strategic plan (www.wartburg.edu/transform). The campaign engages a Steering Committee and National Campaign Committee to guide the work of volunteers and initiatives. ","As mentioned above, the committees are made of friends, alumni, community members, and other stakeholders. Members represent a wide range of expertise and disciplines.

*  Business
*  Diversity
*  Engineering Science
*  German Institute
*  Journalism and Communication
*  Leadership
*  Library
*  Pathways Center
*  Social Work
*  Wartburg West. 

This is not an exhaustive list.","Although far from being the only example, our Commission on Mission process is a great example of a process which sought community stakeholder engagement, and resulted in significant outcomes. The outcome of the Commission on Mission, the 2010-2020 Strategic Plan, provided guidance on  operations and initiatives for the future. Born from this plan, the Transforming Tomorrow campaign lies heavily on the stakeholder beliefs and feedback collected during and after the Commission on Mission to identify priorities for growth and change. As a result of building a campaign upon the feedback of our community has allowed the campaign to be very successful. ",http://www.wartburg.edu/about/,--

The Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) invites members of the community to the Excellence in Diversity Awards. The Real Talk Diversity Series is also open to the public. LBGT Student Services in conjunction with CSES work with local businesses that are LBGT friendly during their Ready to Work series where a LBGT-friendly career field is held. DMA also works with businesses to support employment for their students. ODI has worked with Mercantile Bank to assist underrepresented students in gaining internships or employment. 

Additionally, through the 2014 Islam in Global Perspectives Speaker Series eight experts from a range of disciplinary and/or activist backgrounds where brought to campus to examine how Islam as a globalized moral, legal, and cultural system adapts itself to situations of plurality, minoritization, and modernity. The goal of the series was to spark campus and community-wide discussion on themes critical to understanding contemporary Muslim cultures and societies, as well as to foster a network of scholars who are located in and around Michigan.","-Community In Schools ( Educational organization)
