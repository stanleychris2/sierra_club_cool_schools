","The FGCU College of Education partners with many groups representing the most vulnerable members of society. 

FGCU COE in partnership with USF is a member of the The Center for Autism & Related Disabilities. This organization is a community-based project that provides information and consultation to individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders and related disabilities. CARD-USF offers instruction and coaching to families and professionals through a training and assistance model.

FGCU's family resource center The mission and goals of the Family Resource Center are:
To promote the social, emotional, moral, cognitive, language and physical development of each child by:
— providing support and resources for families
— forming and enhancing nurturing relationships between each child
    and teacher where each child is cherished for his or her own unique
    qualities
— creating a rich developmentally and culturally appropriate curriculum

To build partnerships with families through mutual respect, open communication, and opportunities for active participation.
To facilitate interactions between and among families.
To model, convey and promote high quality developmentally and culturally appropriate practices in early care and education to families, professionals, and the community-at-large.
To create a nurturing and responsive environment that provides resources and supports the personal and professional growth of the Center staff.

FGCU is a member of the Florida Inclusion Network and houses an office on campus. The FIN collaborates with all districts and schools to provide customized services and supports ensuring all students with disabilities have the same educational, social, and future opportunities as their peers.

The College of Arts and Sciences houses FGCU's Juvenile Restorative Justice program:
As increased levels of student’s enrollment, behavioral issues, and alcohol and drug problems plague school communities, administrators and teachers are faced with resolving conflict in an expeditious and peaceful manner, while addressing the needs of youth. A modern day movement is transforming the way that school communities think about and respond to wrongful occurrences. Early offenders pose special challenges, but restorative justice offers unique benefits. Not only does restorative justice hold youth accountable for their actions, it also affords them the opportunity to repair the harm they have caused. This approach seeks to balance the needs of the victim and the community as well as consequences and accountability for the wrong-doer, and requires that each should be actively involved in the process to the greatest extent possible. Restorative practices, as related to educational discipline, provide schools with an opportunity to address the standards of discipline and facilitate a forum for the peaceful resolution to conflict.

","FGCU has been home to many outreach and engagement conferences in the last three years including but not limited to:

Attain to Retain Conference - For a host of reasons, men and women of color are far less likely than their white and Asian peers to earn college degrees. A recent study by the College Board determined that, as of 2008, only 16 percent of Latino and 28 percent of African-American men ages 25 to 34 had obtained an associate degree or higher. That compares with 44 percent of white men and 70 percent of Asian men. Similarly, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, as of 2010, only 10 percent of Latina, 6 percent Asian and 11 percent of African-American females had obtained an associate degree or higher. That compares with 66 percent of white females.

The Attain to Retain Conference aims to help narrow these gaps by assisting college-age under-represented students to understand the challenges they face and the critical need to overcome those challenges if they are to succeed in college and beyond. Participants will have the opportunity to meet and talk with a panel of distinguished experts who will offer them coping strategies and direction geared to helping them be successful in college.

The Community Speaks Lecture Series - The mission of the Office of Community Outreach is to foster strong University-community partnerships that increase the visibility, accountability, and participation of the University in the surrounding Southwest Florida community, assist with the recruitment and retention efforts of the University, and create a cohesive support system for students from traditionally underserved or underrepresented backgrounds. In keeping with this mission, we sponsor The Community Speaks lecture series, which features community leaders from Southwest Florida.

Cerebral Palsy Symposium
An FGCU student group is putting on their second annual event, Cerebral Palsy Symposium 2013. It will take place on November 18 at Florida Gulf Coast University. A complimentary banquet for speakers and individuals with CP and their families will begin at 5:30pm in the Cohen Center Terrace; the main event will be from 7:00 - 9:30 PM in the Cohen Center Ballroom and is free for all to attend. Our target audience is individuals with CP and their families and faculty/students and members of the general public who are interested in learning more about the disorder. We have speakers from research teams/institutes, physicians, organization representatives (United Cerebral Palsy, Special Equestrians), and we will be showing video clips/presentations from several international groups who could not be represented in person.

Annual Children's Mental Health Conference - ccording to NIMH, half of all lifetime cases of mental disorders begin by age 14. In any given year, only 20 percent of children with mental disorders are identified and receive health services as reported by the U.S. Public Health Services.

This conference aims to raise awareness and sensitivity by providing accurate information while bringing all stakeholders together to form a community alliance. The consequences of untreated mental health disorders in children and adolescents are severe. Preventing suicide, school failure, criminal behavior, and substance abuse are what we, as advocates, aim for as we promote treatment and recovery for our children and youth.

Join us for a day of learning, networking, and sharing. We can all become better advocates for our children.

Small Business Access to Capital Fair - The First Annual FSBDC @ Florida Gulf Coast University Access to Capital Fair is an opportunity for small business owners and entrepreneurs who are seeking financial funding to meet financial institutions and other alternative sources of financing. After meeting the lenders in a trade show environment, attend breakout sessions consisting of:
Crowdfunding/ Crowdlending, How to get s SBA Loan, and Angel investing, Lite breakfast will be offered.

The Kleist Health Education Center at FGCU provides free health education programs to local schools:
Over the past years, the Kleist Health Education Center has been invited to “partner” with numerous school districts as their comprehensive health curriculum provider. With the increasing demands on teachers’ time and meeting standards and wellness policy requirements, outreach education is much more effective. The KHEC educators will have time to respond to specific school needs, provide enrichment activities for students and deliver critical health and safety lessons, thus promoting positive change, raising awareness, inspiring action and saving lives. We look forward to working with your class, school, community group or entire district!

Also, the Kleist Health Education Center offers on site health education: The Kleist Health Education Center offers dynamic health education programs all year around, spring, summer, winter, and fall. Our programs are developmentally appropriate for all ages 3 to adult. We offer five different cores areas of health education: general health, nutrition and fitness, drug education, human growth and development, and character education.",http://www.fgcu.edu/Connect/index.html,--

Most stakeholder relations are managed on a personal level or with the most relevant campus departments.  Partner NGOs work with specific offices on campus.

","Starting in 2012, the Collaboration utilized three citizen work groups to evaluate current matters and concerns associated with traffic and parking; planning and housing; and livability in neighborhoods close to campus.

A joint steering committee made up of City and OSU representatives oversees the overall Collaboration project, as well as the three work groups.

The work groups engaged with community and campus stakeholders – as well as planning, housing and traffic experts – to evaluate and recommend potential solutions and new strategies to the Corvallis City Council and the leadership of Oregon State University.

Priority topics to be addressed include:
    neighborhood parking
    code enforcement, including noise and trash
    infill design
    rental housing codes
    traffic mitigation

PROCEDURES (Regulation)
""Policy"" is defined as a statement of principle or intent designed to direct future decisions and actions.
As such, a Senate policy is understood to have broad meaning for the direction of the educational affairs of the University. The implementation of such policy is carried out through Senate committees or a variety of university administrative and faculty offices and bodies following procedures, which the committee defines as rules prescribed for conduct and for implementation. For clarity, for coherency, and for the best understanding of academic responsibilities and roles, these policies and procedures
should be established deliberately and clearly by the Senate. It is the responsibility of implementing bodies, whether Senate committees or other university offices or units, to seek Senate approval for any course or action relating to educational policies and procedures which fall within the Senate's responsibilities as established by paragraph 19 of The Wilfrid Laurier University Act, 197","Terms of Reference


Laurier, as a multi-campus university, is a federation of campuses. However we have not fully determined what type of federation we should be as a university. There are numerous possibilities (just as no one multi-campus model works best, neither is there a perfect model of a federation).

Over the past 11 years decisions about academic programming, provision of services, lines of authority and accountability, and many other matters have been made in the absence of an over-arching federation or governance model. Processes and practices have evolved in an ad hoc fashion, without the benefit of guidance that an overarching governance framework would provide.

Governance: is the process whereby societies or organizations make important decisions, determine whom they involve and how they render account. (Canada Institute on Governance).

Premises: The work of the Task Force is guided by the Vision, Values, and Mission statement of the university. More specifically, the work of the Task Force is founded on the recognition:

1. That Laurier embraces a multi-campus model of operations and that it will be a multi-campus university for the foreseeable future

2. That Laurier values an intimate and supportive community environment that is most readily achieved when student numbers do not exceed approximately 15,000 in any one locality

3. That Laurier aspires to excellence in education that engages students in purposeful developmental activities both inside and outside the classroom

4. That Laurier aspires to increased research intensity in the context of a number mid-sized campuses, each delivering undergraduate education and a limited number of focused, nationally and internationally recognized areas of research excellence

5. That Laurier aspires to complementarity among teaching and research foci among its campuses such that synergies are enabled to ensure that the whole university has impact and presence that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Mandate: of the Presidential Task Force on Multi-Campus Governance is to build on these premises and the Vision, Mission and Values statement to identify and recommend to the university community an overarching model of federation and governance among the existing and potential campuses of Laurier. Considerations should include, but not be limited to:

    identifying principles that should guide the distribution of academic programs across campuses

    principles to guide the allocation of resources among campuses

    the functions of academic, administrative, and student leaders (Deans, Chairs, Directors, Managers, etc) across campuses,

    identifying the principles that should be applied to make changes in composition of the Board and Senate as campuses develop and grow,

    shifts in representation that should be implemented in university committees as new campuses grow,

    expectations of the university community to be participating citizens across campuses as well as at their “home” campus

    identifying principles to establish the administrative structures that must follow from governance recommendations of the Task Force

    such other matters as the task force identifies as fundamental to effective and efficient governance in multiple locations

Timeframe: The work of the Taskforce will begin in March 2010 and is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the calendar year.

Reporting: The task force will report to the university community with a report of its findings and it will also report separately to the Board, Senate, Brantford faculty, Academic Faculties, and such other bodies and groups as are deemed appropriate.

Consultation: The Task Force will consult stakeholder communities widely and appropriately as it conducts its work.
