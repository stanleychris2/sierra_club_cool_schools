The Eskimo Curlew is a migratory bird that lives in three different places in one year. It prefers open tall grass fields such as prairies and pastures. This site has patches of tall grass such as Yaku Jima and Fountain Grass, however the site does not provide an adequate habitat for the Eskimo Curlew to live, because the grasses are all individually planted with enough spacing that they do not touch each other.

Small Whorled Pogonia (Isotria meleoloides)
The Small Whorled Pogonia grows in second to third succession forests, meaning middle aged trees and some ground cover.  It prefers moist, acidic soil with low organic material.  The plant usually grows in the presence of dead material such as fallen trunks and leaves. It prefers moderate sunlight with little groundcover plants such as ferns around it. The Pogonia also prefers growing near features that create long breaks in forest canopies, such as roads or streams. The site selected contains soils with a pH of 5.2, and an organic content of .28%. Ground cover is well spread, with several mature trees. One challenge is the water content, because most plants are drought tolerant the goal is aiming for minimal watering which the Small Whorled Pogonia may not be able to tolerate. Finally, the Small Whorled Pogonia shares a very crucial relationship with particular fungal species, which are not known at this time but the absence of its presence will be fatal to the Small Whorled Pogonia.

Primary forest: 5 acres of primary maple-beech forest that contains beech, oaks, black cherry trees and maples 200 year or older. Over 1200 trees are marked and surveyed years to determine their grown and mortality rates. 
   
 b. Wetlands:  A study done in 2011, identified seven emergent wetland areas with a total of 16,642 SF.  The study used soils, hydrology and vegetation as indicators.

c. Ground nesting bird areas:  The Farm has over 80 acres of bird ground nesting that host many bird species including rare ones such as bobolink and meadowlark. The meadows are mowed once per year, after the nesting season, to preserve the grassy characteristic which is ideal for these species. Several bird population surveys take place at the Farm during spring, summer and winter. Groups include a bird watching course, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History(CMNH) and the Gates Mills Bird society.","   a. Bluebird Trail: Installation of 58 bluebird houses around the property to increase the eastern bluebird population. Since 2012, the trail had produced over 690 bluebird fledglings. The houses are monitored on weekly basis from March to August and data is shared with Cornell University. (https://students.case.edu/farm/conservation/bluebird.html)

     b. The salamander lagoon was built in 2002 to increase the diversity of the salamander populations that were rare at the farm due to the lack of intermittent water bodies.  By 2004, the wood frog population lagoon was well established. During the spring of 2007, Jefferson salamanders (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) were found in the lagoon for the first time. The lagoon diversity is monitored by several of the herpetologist faculty members as well as CMNH researchers. https://students.case.edu/farm/conservation/lagoon.html

     c. A total of 5 acres of native prairie species have been established since 2006.

Beech Hill Farm is a 73-acre property in the town of Mount Desert comprising forest and farmland on a ridge of deep glacial till soils. Maine Coast Heritage Trust holds a conservation easement on the property, “to provide a significant public benefit by protecting and preserving the highly scenic and open views of and across the protected property enjoyed by the public from the Beech Hill Road; and to prevent the conversion of open lands on prime agricultural soils to development or other land uses that would limit their productivity and availability for agricultural uses in the future.” 

The Peggy Rockefeller Farms comprise 125 acres that include part of the largest remaining contiguous area of pasture on Mount Desert Island. The property, which is protected under a conservation easement held by Acadia National Park, includes prime agricultural soils suitable for cropping, livestock, orchards, and other uses. Two-thirds of the property is covered with second-growth forest or wetland. The property is in the Northeast Creek Watershed, which is monitored closely by the U.S. Geological Survey. The land also shares a boundary with property owned and protected by the Audubon Society. Both Beech Hill Farm and the Peggy Rockefeller Farms are in close proximity to Acadia National Park land. 

The Cox Protectorate is a 100-acre, forested parcel that was donated to the college to be used exclusively for field research and primitive recreation. There is no formal conservation easement on the Protectorate property at this time, but students and classes have begun inventorying, monitoring, and developing management plans for the property. 

The college also owns twelve acres on Great Duck Island, a 220-acre island that is about 90 minutes south of our main campus by boat, and is home to our Alice Eno Field Research Station. The majority of the island is owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the college and TNC manage the island collaboratively for purposes of conservation and research. 
",True,True,"The easement holders of Beech Hill Farm and Peggy Rockefeller Farms (Maine Coast Heritage Trust and Acadia National Park, respectively) conduct annual assessments and monitoring of both properties. 

Biodiversity inventories of the Cox Protectorate have been conducted by several student researchers and students in wildlife ecology classes. As of March 2015 the vegetational biodiversity inventory is believed to be comprehensive for trees, good for shrubs, adequate for herbaceous flowering plants, good for ferns and fern allies, and incomplete for bryophytes, liverworts, and lichens. We know of no surveys that have looked at the macrofungi or freshwater algae of the Protectorate; but these have been identified as the next priority for biodiversity inventories on the property. 

The vegetation survey was conducted initially with 25 10x10 meter plots set along transects of the property. The natural history survey was conducted through use of game cameras and direct observation on the property. Student researchers have also examined and compiled Maine critical areas program listings, Maine ""Beginning with Habitat"" GIS data layers, and Acadia National Park GIS data layers. Assessment and inventorying of this property is ongoing, as the property is still relatively new to the college. 

Great Duck Island is home to the Alice Eno Field Research Station where COA student researchers spend each summer inventorying and monitoring seabird populations and habitat. Additional research projects have focused on other flora and fauna on the island. A summary of several recent student research projects can be found on our website: http://coa.edu/islands/research-projects/","Great Duck Island supports some of the largest known breeding populations of Leach’s storm petrels and black guillemots in the continental United States. These, along with resident herring and black-backed gulls, are subjects of ongoing research by teams of students from the college’s Island Research Center under the supervision of faculty member John Anderson. Of major concern is the island’s large population of varying hare, a species that was introduced in the mid-20th century, and has had an enormous impact on the island’s flora. 

The Peggy Rockefeller Farms include important bobolink and songbird habitat, as well as wetlands that drain into the ecologically sensitive Northeast Creek. ","All of COA's properties, and particularly Beech Hill and Peggy Rockefeller farms, are managed using strictly organic methods to protect watersheds and biodiversity. At the Peggy Rockefeller Farms, we are re-establishing a riparian buffer along wetlands and creeks. Animals are kept away from riparian areas and wetlands, and we are cultivating vegetables and fruit in the high and dry soils, not the low and wet. We are also observing and marking pasture areas with heavy bobolink activity and avoiding grazing/haying/mowing of those areas until August. On both farms we also use cover cropping to prevent soil erosion from wind and rain.

",True,True," The Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) has served as a key research site for livestock grazing and rangeland ecosystem dynamics/structure in the western Great Plains since it was established in 1937. The CPER exemplifies ongoing challenges faced by semiarid rangelands around the world to simultaneously manage for both ecosystem goods (e.g., livestock production) and services (e.g., biodiversity, wildlife habitat, carbon storage, greenhouse gas mitigation, hydrological functions) in a changing climate. Our current conceptual framework views climate, disturbance regimes, and physiography as the key interacting factors that structure population and community processes, and influence ecosystem productivity, states and services. Current research experimentation is addressing production-conservation issues and associated tradeoffs with beef production when other ecosystem services are incorporated into management objectives. The CPER has a >70 year history of research on vegetation and livestock including key datasets encompassing: 1) aboveground forage production, 2) livestock weight gains, 3) climatological data, 4) soil carbon, 5) carbon and trace gas fluxes, 6) rainfall simulation experiments, 7) climate change (elevated atmospheric CO2 and increased temperatures), and 8) remote sensing with high resolution (<10 mm) aerial images.

These holdings are protected and actively managed for conservation purposes by Cornell Plantations.

Part of these holdings are also legally designated by New York State Statute as a Recreational River.  In 1986 New York State passed the Wild, Scenic and Recreational Rivers System Act to prevent “Improvident development and use of these rivers and their immediate environs…” N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 27, §. tit. 27, § 666.1 (1986).

     ",True,True,"There are a number of assessment methodologies that we use:

Tompkins County Unique Natural Areas Inventory.  This began as a masters-thesis project completed in 1976.  It has been enlarged and continued and is now overseen by Tompkins County Planning Department and Tompkins County Environmental Management Council.  Various collaborations with Cornell Plantations Natural Areas Program staff have occurred over the years and have contributed important expertise and guidance.  It now includes the 194 most important natural areas in the county.  Field visits were made to sites to document the biota and ecological communities present, as well as, conservation status, physical characteristics, geological importance, and aesthetic, scenic or cultural qualities.  Periodic updates have occurred at approximately 10-year intervals.  

Evaluation of Natural Areas process.  Periodically we have produced internal studies evaluating the relative importance and degree and kind of use of our various holdings. This is done to help prioritize our actions and justify what we do within the priorities of the university.

We make periodic visits to all of our sites.  Several preserves include biotic inventories, which are updated as new occurrences are identified. Monitoring or census counts are conducted for rare species occurrences, these are observed sometimes as often as several times a year. This monitoring is conducted to identify declines or other conservation challenges, which inform management actions. 

For example, all unfenced portions of our natural areas holdings are experiencing significant impact to the understory vegetation and associated fauna by excessive deer browse. To gauge the impact and track the efficacy of our lethal and non- lethal deer management program, a vegetation monitoring regime has been implemented to assess population levels and vegetation impact. This is combined with harvest information and mark/recapture deer census work using infrared cameras to track population changes. 
","The managed natural areas present within the Cornell campus includes 660 total acres. This preserve system encompasses 32 distinct natural and anthropogenic plant community types. Specifically, this includes:

Successional old field
A meadow on sites cleared, plowed, and then abandoned. The ragweed type occurs on fields 1 to 3 years after last cultivation; ragweed, daisy, Queen Anne's lace, crab grass, golden foxtail, and chickweed are common. The goldenrod subtype occurs 3 - 15 years after last cultivation. Dominant species are perennial composites: goldenrods and asters. Other herbs include timothy, orchard grass, smooth brome, bluegrasses, quackgrass, sweet vernal grass, evening primrose, old-field cinquefoil, wild strawberry, and hawkweeds. Shrubs and trees represent less than 50% cover but include gray dogwood, arrowwood, raspberries, blackberries, sumac, red maple and white pine.

Mixed oak forest

Characteristic trees include sycamore, cottonwood, box elder, silver and red maple, butternut, crack and white willow. American elm was once present. Characteristic vines and shrubs are Virginia creeper, poison ivy, and spicebush. Characteristic herbs are white snake root, green dragon, jewelweed, ostrich fern, and jumpseed.

Riverside sand/gravel bar
A meadow community that occurs on sand and gravel bars deposited within, or adjacent to, a river channel. The community may be very sparsely vegetated, depending on the rates of deposition and erosion of the sand or gravel. Characteristic species include sandbar willow (Salix exigua), sand-cherry (Prunus pumila), dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).

Sedge meadow
A wet meadow with permanently saturated and seasonally flooded organic soils in wetlands that receive mineral nutrients via groundwater or streams. There is usually little peat accumulation and floating mats are not formed. Sedge meadows typically occur along streams and near the inlet and outlets of lakes and ponds.

Conifer plantation
A planted stand of commercial trees species, usually for timber purposes. Usually a monoculture, but they may be mixed stands with two or more species. Species typically planted include white pine, red pine, Scotch pine, Norway spruce, Douglas fir, European larch, and Japanese larch.

Rich graminoid fen
Here the substrate is a graminoid peat which may be underlain by marl. The dominant species are sedges (Carex flava, C. hystericina, C. sterilis), with grasses and rushes. Sphagnum is restricted to a few species, but other mosses may be abundant. Other species are cattails, sundew, pitcher plant, cranberry, and grass-of-parnassus. Trees and shrubs have less than 50% cover, but include red-osier and gray dogwoods, shrubby cinquefoil, and swamp buckthorn. Rich fens are fed by water from highly calcareous springs or seepage rich in minerals with high pH, (6.5 to 8). They are underlain by glacial gravels with peat deposits. This community is often found with other fen communities which may form a mosaic on one site.

Mowed areas
Land in which the groundcover is dominated by clipped grasses and forbs. The ecological community type with trees has more than 30% cover of trees. The type also includes narrow strips of mowed pathway, such as a roadside or utility corridor.

Characteristic vegetation includes emergent aquatics such as yellow pond lily, white waterlily, cattails, bulrushes, burreed, and arrow arum. Disturbed marshes may have purple loosestrife, reedgrass, or reed canary grass. Marsh communities occur on mineral soils or fine-grained organic soils that are permanently saturated. They are often found near the Finger Lakes or in wetlands near a drainage divide. Because water levels may fluctuate, exposing substrate and aerating the soil, there is little or no accumulation of peat.

Hickory-white ash-oak type
The forest occurs on flat uplands and gentle to moderate slopes. Soil is of moderate pH and well to moderately well drained. Shagbark hickory as a dominant is an indicator of this ecological community type. Mesophytes of fertile soils such as white ash, basswood, tulip poplar, sugar and red maples are among the dominant species or abundant as a group in this type. Shrubs and herbs often have a weedy component.

","Cornell University protects and manages the campus as natural areas, wildlife habitats, and naturalistic landscaped areas in support of wildlife biodiversity.  These lands include two gorges, 70,425 feet of streams and riparian habitats, mature and successional forests, marsh, wet meadow, and old field habitats, as well as Plantations Botanic Garden and F.R. Newman Arboretum. These areas, which comprise 32% of the campus, are actively protected and managed to support the educational mission of the University.  Management activities include but are not limited to monitoring, habitat establishment, natural areas restoration, naturalization, invasive species control, and deer over-population management.

Several of these habitats are recognized for their regional significance, including the Mitchell Street Hawthorn Thicket Natural Area, which is recognized as a ""migrant trap"" for neo-tropical migrating birds, and the Bull Pasture Ponds, which supports a very high diversity and abundance of amphibians.  

Cornell University also supports a deer research and management program to reduce negative impacts of deer overpopulation on and near campus.  Discussions and actions regarding deer damage management reflect the University's goal to maintain the integrity of Cornell lands, while being cognizant of related neighborhood impacts. The project is being implemented for the primary purposes of supporting the research, teaching, and outreach functions of Cornell University.

We did not have any species of significance found during the initial assessment, but will be working with them to keep researching.",True,True,"During the 2014/2015 academic year, the Campus Sustainability Committee focused on natural resources on campus. Duke has conducted several ecological surveys among the Chapel Woods (4.5 acres), Anderson Woods (6 acres), and Cameron Woods (3 acres).  The method of these studies included a major survey of all plant species and invasive species in these strongly pedestrian forest ecosystems in September 2014.  These sites will be monitored for environmentally sensitivities. In March 2015, two land parcels (Chapel Woods and Anderson Woods, were officially declared to be preserved by the Board of Trustees (http://today.duke.edu/2015/06/trees).

Also, research from two PhD students and a faculty member from the Nicholas School of the Environment led to the prioritization of buildings on campus that were leading to bird collisions with windows. Windows' reflective nature can lead birds to flying into them, so the researchers made recommendations to reduce the likelihood of collision by adding UV reflective dots on windows, which was implemented on one building on campus (http://today.duke.edu/2015/06/trees).","Duke has identified 122 live bird species on campus. Of these species, about 22 have been found dead on campus as well.  The Chapel Woods, Anderson Woods, and Cameron Woods survey completed in September 2014 identified an incomplete list of around 70 plant species.  Although this study did not specifically set out to survey animals, worm snakes and white spotted slimy salamanders were also identified on campus. Gray squirrels, white-tailed deer, and domestic cats have also been identified.  ","Duke University has a number of current efforts regarding wildlife habitat preservation and conservation including wetland restoration and forest management. Duke University has made a significant investment in restoring wetlands in the Duke Forest.  SWAMP is a 14-acre restored wetland-stream-lake ecosystem located along a stretch of Sandy Creek in Duke Forest, at the edge of Duke’s campus. Prior to its restoration, the site was so heavily eroded and degraded by storm water runoff that it no longer functioned as a healthy wetland. By re-contouring and replanting the degraded Sandy Creek ecosystem and constructing a new earthen dam and a four-acre storm water reservoir below it, the project reduced nitrate levels flowing downstream into the drinking water supply by 64%, and phosphorus levels by 28%, at a cost of about $2 million.  In addition to its roles as a pollution buffer and wildlife habitat, the restored ecosystem serves as an outdoor classroom, training center and field laboratory. 

Nearly the entire Duke Garden supports habitat for wildlife. (https://gardens.duke.edu/)  The mature tree canopy, thick shrub understory, variety of fruiting trees and shrubs, and water features provide a rich diversity of habitat for birds and countless other wildlife.   Bird watching tours are popular and designated bird watching structures are available in the Blomquist Garden. 

When planning and implementing all Duke forest management activities, efforts are made to minimize negative impacts to areas with rare species, unique ecosystems and significant natural features. (http://www.dukeforest.duke.edu/) These significant natural areas are included in what Duke Forest considers to be High Conservation Value Forests (HCVF’s) or Forests of Exceptional Conservation Value (FECV’s). The Duke Forest Office maintains records on the location of these significant natural areas and, in some cases, detailed species lists for these sites. In 2004 twelve separate areas of the Duke Forest totaling 1,200 acres were included in the North Carolina Registry of Natural Heritage Areas. The registry agreement states that it is the intention of Duke University to maintain these properties for the perpetuation of natural processes, natural communities and rare species populations. Registration of these sites is consistent with the overall management goals of the Forest, which includes providing research and teaching areas where human disturbance is minimized. The Natural Heritage Program continues to inventory and survey for threatened and endangered plant and animal species within the Duke Forest. Presently there are no federally-listed endangered or threatened species inhabiting the Duke Forest. ",http://sustainability.duke.edu/academics/research/wetland.html,--

Green Mountain College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:55:16,ihrker@greenmtn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The Poultney River has been designated an “Outstanding Resource Water” by the state of Vermont, and the lower Poultney River is bordered by TNC’s Buckner Preserve. The College campus is upstream of the TNC segment, but the conservation activities of the College have an impact on the downstream quality of the river.

Most of the 39 acre natural areas on the 123 acre main campus lies on the Poultney River floodplain. A portion of this land is classified as Class 2 Wetland, and wetlands along part of the northern edge of campus are part of extensive wetlands (shrub swamps and cattail marsh) to the north. Class 2 wetlands are on national wetland inventory maps, and are legally protected from development. Rare plants and
animals have been documented on campus by the Vermont State Agency of Natural Resources. 

Protected wetlands on campus and to the north include a variety of plant community types associated with the Poultney River floodplain. Along the river shore there are erosional river bluffs, and river-sand-gravel shores. Silver maple-ostrich fern riverine floodplain forest grows in the frequently-flooded flats near the river. Further from the river, wetlands occupy depressions left by past flooding events, and old river channels. Cattail marsh, alluvial shrub swamp, and alder swamp can be found there.

The College’s 85-acre Lewis Deane Nature Preserve, off campus, is protected by a conservation easement owned by the Vermont Land Trust. The Preserve rises steeply to the west from a small headwater stream, Endless Brook, on sand and gravel of glacial origin, to the top of St. Catherine Mountain with thin soils over slate. In addition to a small old field near the brook and very small pockets of wetland conditions along the brook and in seeps and vernal pools, there are about twelve upland plant communities, dominated by northern hardwood forest, white pine-northern hardwood forest on a sandy glacial deposit, and hemlock-northern hardwood forest and hemlock forest on steep northeast-facing slopes in thin soil. Rich northern hardwood forest occurs at the foot of steep slopes, along with mesic red oak-northern hardwood forest and mesic maple-ash-hickory-oak forest. The ridge-top has dry oak-hickory-hophornbeam forest and dry oak forest. On the upper southwest-facing bluffs there are small but significant stands of red pine woodland, temperate acidic outcrops, and temperate acidic cliffs. As in much of this region of Vermont, land was probably cleared to the ridgetop during the 1845-1855 boom years for sheep grazing, but the presence of some trees pre-dating this time period on steep bluffs may indicate that difficult-to-reach patches of forest were never cut. Most of the preserve is fairly mature second-growth forest today. 
",True,True,"The most recent activity was a biotic assessment of the Poultney River segments that run through campus in fall 2013 for fish and invertebrate communities. The aquatic assessment uses EPA’s Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for use in wadeable streams (fish, invertebrate, periphyton, habitat). 

For example, since 1996, botany students have searched main campus for plants. Their collections are in the Green Mountain College Herbarium. Similarly, collections document the flora for Deane Nature Preserve. The College held its first BioBlitz over a 24-hour period on April 30-May1, 2012. Attracting several good botanists, a lichen expert, a bryologist, and a mycologist, they were able to document a
number of species not previously observed on campus.

Similarly, birds and mammals have been documented, both by students in the ornithology class and other biology courses, and by the independent work of faculty and students.

In all cases, communities are mapped, showing which ones are rare on campus. In the region, the plant communities found at the top of the preserve are most rare, being limited in Vermont to warm, well-drained southern exposures.

Long-term studies by students in ecology, botany, aquatic ecology, and others provide good data on some natural areas. However, the best methods for identifying rare species or sensitive areas have been larger independent studies by students and by faculty. For example, an independent study on the seedless vascular plants of Deane Preserve revealed the presence of several uncommon fern species for the first time.","No endangered species are identified within the river on campus, though the lower Poultney does contain several rare mussel species as well as some Vermont threatened minnow species. The degree to which these remain viable depends upon conservation activities of all the upstream landowners. Primary consideration within the river is sediment and bank stability.

Among the plant communities listed for Deane Nature Preserve, dry oak-hickory-hophornbeam forest, dry oak forest, red pine woodland, temperate acidic outcrops, and temperate acidic cliffs are the most rare in the region. Their rarity is related to their association with dry, warm, well-drained conditions, more common in the central and southern Appalachians, or in prairie regions in the upper Midwest where some of the species here become more common. Fire is not the major ecological factor in most Vermont plant communities that it is in many other regions, but in these dry oak and red pine communities, we find species with adaptations to surface fire, including thick bark.

Information on rare species at the Dean Nature Preserve originates from Ruth Larkin's study:
Larkin, Ruth. 2010. Up on the mountain: a natural and cultural history of the Lewis Deane Nature Preserve. Senior Study for Green Mountain College.","The Poultney River Buffer Zone is a natural area preserve on the Green Mountain College campus alongside the Poultney River, generally occupying land within 35 meters of the annual high-water line. The buffer zone was approved by the College in 1997 to improve stream habitat, reduce bank erosion, restore floodplain forest, provide a corridor for movements of animals and plants, reduce overland flow of non-point source pollution from agricultural fields and other land uses, protect scenic and recreation values, and provide field sites for courses and research at the College.

The College expanded protection of habitat with its Natural Areas Policy (2006) that set guidelines for Leave-No-Trace use of the Buffer Zone and all other campus lands outside designed-built areas and the college farm, about one third (39 acres) of the main campus. At the same time, the college adopted its Invasive Species Control Policy (2006) to establish methods for monitoring and reduce the impact of
introduced species on native species. 

GMC maintains natural ecosystem values at its 85-acre Deane Nature Preserve south of the main Poultney campus. The preserve is protected by a conservation easement owned by the Vermont Land Trust, and by a board of the preserve that includes college and town representatives. The board conducted a multi-year planning process for the preserve that led to adoption of the Deane Nature Preserve Plan in April 2012. Management under the plan aims to preserve natural values, including native species and plant communities. The plan allows for land management practices in the future that serve species or other resource management objectives consistent with maintaining native species and communities and education goals. Non-native plant species at the preserve are managed under the Invasive Species Control Policy for the main campus.",http://www.greenmtn.edu/about/our-home/campus-lands/,Information in this section was provided by Professors Meriel Brooks and Jim Graves.

Students have established plots using the Carolina Vegetation Survey methodology in which all species were identified within a 20 x 50 meter plot.  Plots were sampled in the hardwood forests with mature canopies.   

There is one permanent plot which has been sampled three times over the past four years. This plot was established using the Ecological Research as Education Network methodology.  All woody vegetation is recorded and the diameter breast height measured during each sampling.   This plot is located near the southwest corner of the Guilford Woods; near the pond and a house.  

Throughout the Guilford Woods, students have conducted North Carolina Natural Heritage Program Site Survey Reports.  These reports included a species list and description of the natural communities.  Additionally, all of the Guilford Woods was included in class field trips for the instruction of plant and natural community identification.
 
For animals:  Every two years, the Vertebrate Field Zoology class (BIOL 235) has surveyed reptiles and amphibians in the College Woods.  Both aquatic and terrestrial habitats are surveyed.  Every year, the Ornithology class (BIOL 336) conducts a bird census in the College Woods and the main campus.
"," Although no Federal or State-listed endangered species of plants or animals are found on College property, the College Woods and main campus provide habitat for several species of birds that are considered of Special Concern.  Specifically, the Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) breed in the College Woods, and Chimney Swifts (Chaetura pelagica) hunt for insects in flight above the College property. Several species of raptors nest on College property.  In addition, the Woods and main campus provide stopover habitat for many species of neotropical migrant birds during both spring and fall migration. ","Part of the campus master plan designated the campus woods as an area to be preserved.  The Board of Trustees approved this designation.  Our woods are natural habitat for numerous species of native wildlife.  The area known as ""the meadows"" are also excellent habitat for many native species of wildlife.

Students became interested in transforming lawns into meadows after being invited to assist in developing strategies for climate neutrality, a goal of Hampshire’s as a signer of the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment. A group enrolled in earth and environmental science professor Steven Roof’s fall 2012 course, Sustainable Hampshire, presented their ideas to President Jonathan Lash and others. President Lash endorsed the idea and asked that a full proposal be developed.

Planning continued through the spring semester, incorporating independent-study research by students as well as work by staff and faculty. Soil types were studied, appropriate plants and wildlife researched and identified, and maintenance programs and savings projected, culminating in a comprehensive 35-page proposal.

“The students were really excited by this project,” said Professor Roof. “They wanted to reduce our carbon footprint and increase the natural beauty and diversity of our campus. They also wanted to start a project that would provide long-term education and research opportunities for future students.”

May graduate Emily Waters, who helped analyze soils for carbon sequestration potential, agrees. “Being part of this was a cool way to leave a mark on campus, knowing that science students over the next ten years will have opportunities to observe changes in plants and soils and study the conversion,” she said. “This kind of thing is really rare, as it’s usually meadows to lawn instead of lawn to meadows.”

Along with Waters, students John Calvert, Bexx Merck, and Jackson Tilley served on the meadowlands planning team with Roof, sustainability initiative director Beth Hooker and her assistant Neith Little, facilities and grounds director Larry Archey, and Leslie Cox, farm manager.","The meadowlands serve as breeding grounds for many species of birds, like the vester sparrow, which is listed as threatened in Massachusetts. Native plants, some of which are also on the state threatened or endangered lists, will be able to thrive in the new habitat as well.","1.  Much of the 800-acre campus remains forested. Part of the campus is adjacent to the Holyoke Range, which is managed by the MA Department of Conservation and Recreation.  

2.  On the Hampshire College Farm, a 0.3 acre field is managed as a meadow for pollinators and beneficial insects. Hedgerows between vegetable fields and an irrigation pond also serve as wildlife habitat on the farm. 

3. 15 acres on campus has been converted from mowed lawn to actively managed meadowland habitat. The meadowlands are estimated to reduce carbon dioxide levels by up to 12,000 pounds per year, cut back on mowing time by 448 hours per year and save the college about $2,300 per year in diesel fuel costs.

5: The Farm STAR (Sow to Achieve Results) committee is working on a land use plan that will prioritize protective measures for native pollinators, including an official policy banning the use of neonicotinoid pesticides. 

6. 2 new living buildings on campus will generate their own power year-round, the rest of campus will soon benefit from a 19-acre solar array that will deliver up to 6.4 million kWh per year. Hampshire will become the first US residential college generating 100 percent of electricity from on-site renewable sources. With installation slotted for 2016, students and faculty are already exploring research opportunities to study restorative land management and pollinator habitat under the panels.

A field investigation was conducted to map the ecological communities, to inventory native and exotic vegetation, and to identify plant species listed as Endangered, Threatened, or Rare (ETR) by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).

Small, snap-back mousetraps and pitfall traps were used to sample the small mammals at Griffy Lake Nature Preserve. In order to document communities present within each distinct habitat, traps were set near the dry edge of the property where it abutted old field (grassy and/or weedy), within forested areas, and in marshy areas close to the lake. Specifically, traps were set in 33 mousetrap lines, each of which contained 100 traps per line, and in 8 pitfall lines, which contained 10 sunken cans (1000 ml beakers) per line. These traps were sunk to ground level usually under logs and in the runways of small mammals. No attempt was made to trap the larger animals at Griffy Lake Nature Preserve. Rather, documentation of these species was made by observation on site and the presence of tracks, dens, markings, scat, and road kill. 

Mist-netting for bats was conducted at four sites on the property. Each site was netted for one night with two nets deployed per site. Nets were draped across the flyway between the vegetation at each side and extended up to the canopy above. The nets were on a pulley system so that they could be raised and lowered as necessary to retrieve bats. Nets were erected before sunset and in place for 3 hours. Bat detectors were used in addition to the nets to monitor the bat activity in the vicinity of the nets. Data on species, sex, age, reproductive condition, right forearm length, and weight were collected for each captured individual. 

Using the Breeding Bird Atlas protocol (IDNR, 2007), surveyors meandered the Griffy Lake Nature Preserve to document bird species. Once birds were identified by site or call, notation of bird’s activity at the time of observation was made, if possible. Surveys were completed throughout the seasons.

The majority of the field station (approximately 150 acres) is permanently protected by a conservation easement.",True,True,"For decades the Ordway Field Station has been the site of ecological, archaeological,
hydrological, and geological research conducted by scientists from Macalester College, the University of Minnesota, the University of St. Thomas, the National Park Service, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and other institutions and agencies.
The field station was the site of the 2011 Minnesota BioBlitz in which the site was thoroughly sampled for all species and habitat types.
Natural resource management plans were developed for the site in 2001 and 2012.
In 1992 the site was surveyed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources as part of its Minnesota County Biological Survey (MCBS) program inventory of Dakota County.
The National Park Service conducts ongoing research on river otters and bald eagles living within the field station’s boundaries.
The National Park Service has established permanent vegetation monitoring plots within the field station’s boundaries.","Rare Species
The 2011 Minnesota BioBlitz found 11 species of plants at Ordway that were new Dakota County records. The 1992 Minnesota County Biological Survey (MCBS; conducted by the MN Department of Natural Resources) recorded four plant species at Ordway that had significant MN state status (endangered, threatened, or special concern species). Turbercled rein-orchid and tall nut-rush are endangered species, kitten-tail is threatened, and lily-leaf twayblade is rare, but has no legal status. Tubercled rein-orchid is generally found in moist grassy meadows on calcareous or circumneutral substrate (Coffin and Pfannmuller 1988). At Ordway it was found by the MCBS in 1993 in a small wet meadow. 
Tall nut-rush is a conspicuous sedge, distinctive for its smooth, white, enamel-like achenes that have a three-angled, minutely pebbled hypogynium (Coffin and Pfannmuller 1988). In Minnesota it is at the northern periphery of its range and is found in wet sandy swales of prairies, savannas or dunes. At Ordway, it was found in the same area as the rein-orchid. 
Kitten-tail is a strict midwestern endemic. It has never been common in the state because its preferred habitat - gravelly soil in dry prairie, savanna and open woods on bluffs of the St. Croix, Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers - is uncommon. Kitten-tail is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of hairy, oval to heart-shaped leaves (Natureserve 2001). It produces one or more hairy, unbranched stems, 6 to12 inches in height, with a few small, nearly sessile leaves and a dense cylindrical spike of small yellow flowers. Plants usually bloom in May, with fruits dehisced by the end of June. It occurs in small, scattered patches with widely variable numbers of plants per patch. The 1992 MCBS recorded this species on a ridgeline opening in the south part of the oak woodland at Ordway. 
Lily-leaved twayblade was the most abundant of the rare species. This orchid is typically found in mature mesic to moist oak or deciduous forests. It can, however, colonize recently disturbed sites and may be found in thickets of young saplings. At Ordway, numerous patches have been located in the woods over the years, ranging from 7 individuals to over two thousand (Johnson 1994). The largest patches emerged after a burn, to which the species seems to respond vigorously (Johnson 1994). 
The field station is located within the Mississippi River Flyway, a flyway of global significance for migratory bird species. Every year, millions of birds, representing over three hundred species, migrate through the corridor or remain as year-round residents (Korschgen, Krisch and Kenow 1998). This represents 60 percent of all North American species (McGuiness 2000). 
The proximity of Ordway to the River attests to its importance for both migratory and resident species. Bald eagles annually nesting on the property near the river, and the diversity of habitats is home to numerous other species.
The wetlands and ponds at Ordway provide important habitat for amphibians. Surveys completed in 1986 and 2001 (Gerholdt pers. comm.) identified six species of frogs and toads at the property). Four snake species and three turtle species were found. The 2011 MN BioBlitz found five species of amphibians, five species of reptiles and 30 species of fish at Ordway.
Black ash seepage swamps and seepage meadows are increasingly rare. The nearly three acres of black ash seepage swamp identified at the Ordway Field Station comprise over 50 percent of the total recorded by the MN Department of Natural Resources for Dakota County (DNR-CBS Seepage meadows are quite rare in the region and not well documented (Wovcha et al. 1995); only 20 acres were identified in Dakota County (DNR-CBS 1997) and the two seepage meadows identified at Ordway totaled less than one acre.","The Katharine Ordway Natural History Study Area (Ordway Field Station) is located on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, 17 miles from campus.  The nearly 300 acre site was established in 1967 by Macalester College with the help of a major a gift from Katharine Ordway.  The many natural habitats found at Ordway Field Station include tall grass prairie, oak savanna and woodland, riparian forests, seasonal and permanent ponds and springs, and a backwater lake, adjacent to the Mississippi River.

In 1959, the Arizona State Land Department designated 4,000 acres of forest land as an ""outdoor laboratory"" for the School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University. The research and education programs initiated by the designation helped establish the school as one of the top rated forestry institutions in the country.
An agreement signed by Arizona Governor Jane D. Hull in April, 2000 establishes a new paradigm of cooperation for land stewardship in Arizona. Agencies and community groups actively participate by serving on the Centennial Forest Advisory Committee which provides oversight and helps develop a management plan for the Forest. Northern Arizona University’s School of Forestry and the Arizona State Forestry Division coordinate to manage the 47,500 acre area to provide research and education opportunities, reduce the risk of wildfire, restoring damaged ecosystems, provide ecosystem services such as clean water, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, timber, and livestock forage.

Details of protected areas: 
There are three types of legally protected areas on the Centennial Forest. Sections of the forest are protected as critical habitat for Mexican spotted owl, an endangered species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Any management or activities in or around these areas require consultation with US Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency responsible for enforcing the Endangered Species Act. There are also many cultural resources present on Centennial Forest lands, including historic railroad grades, early Flagstaff settlements, logging camps, and ceramic sherds. These cultural resources are federally protected under the AZ SHPO laws. Lastly, the Rogers Lake County Natural Area, located off of Woody Mountain Road, is protected under a conservation easement  created by Coconino County. More information about the Rogers Lake County Natural Area can be found at: http://www.coconino.az.gov/index.aspx?NID=689 

Riparian areas, historic grasslands, and portions of the forest within the Woody Ridge Wildlife Corridor serve as priority sites for biodiversity within the Centennial Forest. Northern Arizona is being impacted dramatically by drought and changes in annual precipitation. Subsequently, it is very important that Centennial Forest protect perennial sources of water, including the Rogers Lake area – an important perennial source of water for wildlife travelling through the San Francisco Peaks region. Portions of Centennial Forest also lie within the Woody Ridge Wildlife Corridor, which links the San Francisco Peaks to the Mogollon Rim via a series of protected public lands, which are managed by a variety of entities including Centennial Forest. This corridor is especially important for the conservation of pronghorn, mountain lion, elk, mule deer, black bear, badger, northern goshawk, Mexican spotted owl, turkey, leopard frog, and bats. Lastly, historic grasslands in the northern portion of Centennial Forest are especially important in terms of diversity of grasses and other plant species.
",True,True,"Before any forest management activity or research project is implemented on the Centennial Forest, a comprehensive survey for sensitive plant and animal species, including endangered and vulnerable species, is conducted to identify possible presence of sensitive species and determine critical habitat areas to be protected if these species are present. This survey involves consultation with wildlife experts from US Fish and Wildlife Service, Arizona Game and Fish Department, Ecological Restoration Institute, and/or US Forest Service. There is also an archeological clearance that must be completed to ensure that culturally sensitive resources are not impacted by potential projects. Lastly, proposed project areas are compared with historic research projects to guarantee that environmentally sensitive areas and valuable research is not compromised by a project. 
Centennial Forest operates as the premiere research and educational forest in northern Arizona. Subsequently, there are many ongoing assessments and monitoring mechanisms occurring on the forest at any given time. Presently, research projects encompass climate change, entomology, pathology, decomposition, wildlife, and soil related themes. Also, the a forest restoration treatment of the Rogers Lake area was recently completed. Centennial Forest is monitoring 49 separate plots for various environmental aspects including risk of wildfire, biodiversity, tree growth and invasive species establishment.  These plots will be monitored into perpetuity using NAU students to collect and analyze data whenever possible. 
","Vegetation
Geology, geomorphology and climate differences help form a diverse array of vegetation in the Centennial Forest. Regional forest and grassland vegetation types are well represented throughout the forest. Vegetation in the northern portion of the Centennial Forest can be classified into four major terrestrial ecosystems and several minor ecosystem classes. These ecosystems, described by potential climax vegetation include approximately 5,000 ha of grasslands (Bouteloua gracilis, Elymus elymoides, Aristida longiseta, and Agropyron smithii), 5,300 ha of pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis, Juniperus monosperma) woodlands, and transition zone forests (J. monosperma-P. ponderosa). The southwest portion of the forest is dominated by extensive (7,200 ha) Pinus ponderosa and P. ponderosa-Quercus gambelii forests. Another 425 ha are composed of vegetation types that include Juniperus deppeana, and Fallugin paradoxa as indicator species. In addition to forests and grasslands, the Centennial Forest contains over 1,200 ha of wetland-meadow ecosystems. Carex, Poa, Festuca, Agropyron, Allium, and Muhlenbergia species typify these environments. Minor vegetation types include Quercus turbinella-Arctostaphylos pungens shrublands which represent a transition zone into upland Sonoran Desert, and Populus tremuloides-Pseudotsuga menziesii forests which transition into mixed-conifer vegetation. Throughout the Centennial Forest, transitional zones between these diverse vegetation types and along elevational gradients are particularly well represented.

The Mexican Spotted Owl is the only listed endangered species on the Forest.  
","The Centennial Forest continually seeks funding and support to protect environmentally sensitive areas and plans to conduct projects as these funds area acquired.

To allow for mitigation of development impacts in the South Neighbourhood lands, studies were undertaken (Hemmera Environmental Consultancy, 2011) to ground truth the important vegetation communities and identify rare / uncommon ecosystem types. Although all vegetation association habitats are considered
important, by identifying and protecting at-risk ecosystems, valued ecosystem components (VECs) and specialized habitats, there is a greater chance that local biodiversity can be conserved post-development.","Provincially blue-listed plant communities:
• western red cedar / sword fern Dry Maritime
• western hemlock / three-leaved foamflower Dry Maritime

Important Habitat types/Valued Ecosystem Components (VECs):
Riparian Habitats
Wet
Mature Coniferous Stands
Significant Wildlife Trees.
","Based on the identification of important vegetation communities and identify rare / uncommon ecosystem types, the Mountain was classified by development considerations.  These considerations are used to influence decision making.

The terrestrial ecosystem and wildlife habitat considerations ratings are based on guidance provided by Federal, Provincial and Municipal legislation along with recognized development Best Management Practices.  

Three categories of development considerations are deemed applicable to terrestrial ecosystems and wildlife habitats:
Moderate Consideration Areas (Orange)
In the South Neighbourhood, the moderate rating is recommended for two Provincially bluelisted plant communities:
• western red cedar / sword fern Dry Maritime
• western hemlock / three-leaved foamflower Dry Maritime
Although there are no specific Federal, Provincial or Municipal approval requirements that
constrain development in these areas, BMPs suggest that development in these areas
should largely be avoided when planning for development.

Low Consideration Areas (Yellow)
These are terrestrial ecosystem and wildlife habitat areas that provide additional
opportunities for BMPs within the South Neighbourhood. These Low Consideration Areas
include: significant trees; conifer dominated forest patches; vegetation buffers around
sensitive ecosystem types (10 meters around blue-listed species); and, cross elevation
forest patch connectivity corridors. In these areas, lower intensity development types can
be accommodated; however, consideration should be provided to enhancing integrity and functionality of non development and higher consideration areas.",--,--

Main campus at Cortland is also adjacent to the City of Cortland  Water Works a preserve for the water department.",True,True,"Methodologies used to identify environmentally sensitive areas include an assessment of the property and the surrounding geography and species.  In many cases, the properties have been owned by SUNY Cortland for a long period of time, as conservation interest and attention to habitat and biodiversity protection have increased and or developed SUNY Cortland has been supportive to those efforts and works with the government agency or entity that has developed the biodiversity protection criteria.  The species assessment includes fish / aquatic and wildlife habitat, forest and vegetation, and open space assessment.  This assessment approach is consistent with New York State Department of Environmental Conservation requirements associated with NYS Natural Heritage Program, Critical Environmental Areas.  Portions of all preservation areas owned by SUNY Cortland are assessed each year.  The assessment is completed predominantly by biology, ecology, and geography departments during visits and summer session intensive programs to the individual sites.  In addition to these hands on learning activities, the following distinct conservation efforts should be noted:  
Raquette Lake Property is within the Adirondack State Park which has its own specific set of governing developmental and site use regulations that govern the property owned by SUNY Cortland as well as the surrounding adjacent properties.  Of note, directly adjacent the Raquette Lake property is a “Wild Forest Area” as defined by New York State DEC.  Within this  Wild Forest Area are areas of Rare Plants and Rare Animals that receive additional classification by DEC through their New York State Natural Heritage Program.   In addition to the Rare Plants and Rare Animal distinction there is also an area of “Significant Natural Communities” which is also classified through DEC’s Natural Heritage Program.  Also of unique note, the buildings on the property are designated as a National Historic Landmark, the first within the SUNY system.  
The Hoxie Gorge has registered Old Growth Forest within its boundary and is adjacent the Hoxie Gorge State Forest as designated by the New York State Department of Conservation.  The Old Growth Forest is registered with the Old-growth Forest Network.  In addition to the State Forest being adjacent to the site, SUNY Cortland establishes area of no disturbance, or no access depending on the level of species activity.  This could be for certain migratory bird species, or certain periods of time throughout the year associated with a specific life cycle of a unique species.  
The Brauer Education Center is located within land that is designated by the DEC’s New York State Natural Heritage Program as having Rare Plants and Rare Animals, and a geologically unique area.  
SUNY Cortland has also been recognized by the Arbor Day Foundation earning the distinction of Tree Campus USA.  SUNY Cortland went through an extensive documentation process complying with the five core assessment areas of the Tree Campus USA program.  Maintain a Campus Tree Advisory Committee, establish a tree-care plan, document a specific annual expenditure to the tree-care plan, annual Arbor Day observance, and the institution needs to sponsor a student in a service-learning project associated with the forestry of the campus.   
Utilizing the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as well as the Arbor Day Foundation environmental assessment methodologies SUNY Cortland has developed a very comprehensive understanding of the environmental attributes associated with our properties.  This information shared and imbued into the curriculum which further builds upon current reassessment work and closely monitors the health and viability of these resources for future generations of students.   
","The primary areas assessed by the campus include a variety of species, habitats and environmentally sensitive or unique settings.  For the Tree Campus USA assessment, 53 varieties of trees were identified and  logged into a database.  Some of the varieties include: dawn redwood, English oak, gingko, green ash, honey locust, lofty elm, black walnut, and London Plane Tree, and Hemlock.  
At the Raquette Lake property some of the unique species within and adjacent to the area include boreal bird species such as: Wood Warblers and American Bittern. In addition to these boreal bird species, the Wild Forest area and Lake also includes loons, northern pike, bullhead, and fine red pine, white pine, and hemlock tree specimens.    
Hoxie Gorge has a stand of old-growth forest within its boundary.  This old-growth forest includes Hemlock which date back as old as 1736.  Other species dating back to the 1800’s include: sweet birch, red maple, and black cherry.

It also borders Ellicott Creek, a secondary tributary to the Niagara River. The creek feeds Tonawanda Creek which empties into the upper Niagara River at the twin cities of Tonawanda/North Tonawanda. The creek is located in the Erie/Ontario Plain of the Niagara River Watershed which stewards 95% of the United States drinking water and 20% of the world's available fresh water.

The waterways that surround the University are also connected 15 miles downstream to one of the seven wonders of the world--Niagara Falls.  The Niagara Escarpment terminates on UB's South Campus and continues north to Niagara Falls  and into Canada.  The escarpment is a recognized UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.  The land form is a largely forested ridge of fossil-rich sedimentary rock (dolostone) 725 km in length. At its highest elevation it soars 1,625 ft. above sea level. As much a hydrological as a geological feature, the headwaters of several rivers rise in the Escarpment and the area is important for groundwater recharge.  The Escarpment area encompasses a rich mosaic of forests, farms, recreation areas, scenic views, cliffs, streams, wetlands, rolling hills, waterfalls, mineral resources, wildlife habitats, historic sites, villages, towns and cities.  The Escarpment’s vibrant ecosystems support 300 bird species, 53 mammals, 36 reptiles and amphibians, 90 fish and 100 varieties of special interest flora including 37 types of wild orchids.

In addition, the Niagara River Corridor has been recognized by Audubon and it's Bird-Life International partners as a 'Global Important Bird Area' with Global referring to the fact that significant proportions (50% in some cases) of the world's population of some species of birds utilize the habitat (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd5mc2SUZsI&feature=youtu.be for a summary video).  

Finally, there are two efforts underway to create new legally protected areas bordering our campuses.  Conversations with NOAA and local organizing efforts to create a Marine Sanctuary for the Niagara River are gaining traction and moving forward.  In addition, The University at Buffalo Law School has been advancing efforts to list the Niagara River Corridor for designation as an internationally important body of water under the Ramsar Convention.  This treaty has designated over 2,000 sites across the world as “Wetlands of International Importance.” Designation leads to increased economic opportunities, tourism, funding opportunities, and environmental appreciation. The bi-national Niagara Region, the United States, Canada, and the world would benefit from including the Niagara River Corridor among these critical resources",True,True,"In 2014 Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper completed an independent study entitled Niagara River Habitat Conservation Strategy under USEPA Grant GL97217710.

The park's forests stretch across Point Grey between UBC and the City of Vancouver. Its thin foreshore wraps around the tip of the peninsula and touches the Fraser River, the Strait of Georgia and Burrard Inlet. Pacific Spirit Regional Park is a legally protected area that includes ecological reserves closed to the public and a variety of environmentally sensitive areas. The Park’s landscape includes ocean beaches, sensitive cliff faces, upland forest and fragile bog. The park offers over 73 km of hiking / biking trails, and over 50 km of equestrian trails. Pacific Spirit Regional Park is managed by the regional government, Metro Vancouver.

UBC’s Land Use Plan (http://planning.ubc.ca/vancouver/planning/policies-plans/land-use-governance-documents/land-use-plan) acknowledges and reinforces the Pacific Spirit Regional Park Management Plan (Section 4.1.1) and specifies that:
-	UBC will follow the policies of the Pacific Spirit Regional Park Management Plan in planning and development.
-	The planning and development of areas adjacent to Pacific Spirit Regional Park will only be done in a manner that protects the park values contained in the Pacific Spirit Regional Park Management Plan.
-	Development and servicing will ensure maintenance of park values and objectives on these lands and other adjacent Pacific Spirit lands

The Land Use Plan (4.1.2.4) also designates green edges of forested development in a number of areas adjacent to the Park “to provide a sense of a community in a forest setting, a natural edge to roadways, wildlife habitat, and to contribute to protecting the integrity of Pacific Spirit Regional Park"".

UBC has finalized an Integrated Stormwater Management Plan (ISMP) which is intended to improve the quantity and quality of the stormwater that leaves the campus in order to minimize the erosive and contaminant impacts on the riparian habitats downstream of the campus.  UBC has also been leading efforts to assess and identify erosion mitigation measures of the cliffs that surround the campus and to minimize the effects that the campus operations and development may have on the cliffs. http://planning.ubc.ca/vancouver/projects-consultations/consultations-engagement/integrated-stormwater-management-plan-ismp

","UBC has identified that the creeks that drain the campus, but are not part of campus lands, are environmentally sensitive and form the basis for the goals of Integrated Stormwater Management Plan (ISMP).  There are five discharge locations, four natural and one engineered that discharge storm water to the ocean.  The riparian habitats associated with the creeks are of concern to the University and one of these creeks, Booming Ground Creek, has been identified as supporting salmonids.  The ISMP for the campus includes practices and controls to improve the quality of the stormwater discharge and moderate the discharge quantities in order to minimize the erosive effects.

The cliffs that surround the campus are sensitive areas and the University has been involved in studying and developing plans to mitigate the erosion that could threaten the environment and campus facilities.  Beginning in the 1970s, studies have been completed to monitor the cliffs and ensure that campus development does not negatively affect the cliffs.  The culmination of this was the UBC/Pacific Spirit Park Cliff Erosion Management Plan in 2001.  Since that time, UBC has sponsored additional studies to monitor the condition of the cliffs and mitigate the effects of erosion including LiDAR surveys to monitor cliff recession.  

An assessment of wildlife and vegetation, and recommendations for impact mitigation, are outlined in the Environmental Assessment conducted of UBC South Campus Neighbourhood, prepared to aid in the development of the Wesbrook Place Neighbourhood Plan: http://planning.ubc.ca/sites/planning.ubc.ca/files/documents/planning-services/policies-plans/SC_EA_Final_Nov04.pdf.

UBC TREE MANAGEMENT 
http://planning.ubc.ca/vancouver/planning/policies-plans/trees
There are approximately 8,000 trees planted and over 10,000 native trees in natural settings at UBC’s Vancouver campus. The University has professional arborists who manage this urban forest. Campus + Community Planning works with architects and arborists to protect UBC's urban forest.  UBC encourages tree retention through its campus plan and guidelines. However, at times, select trees may need to be removed. Notices of such activity will be posted online.

As per UBC’s Land Use Plan, section 4.1.2.3, a) A tree management plan will be prepared as part of the area planning process to ensure the long term viability of green edges and retained natural vegetation and to provide street and other planting; b) Any viable mature trees over 15cm calliper dbh (diameter at breast height) that must be removed during the course of residential development in neighbourhoods will be replaced on campus at a ratio of 1:1, using species appropriate to the setting, and allowing trees to be sited as appropriate through the campus. http://planning.ubc.ca/vancouver/planning/policies-plans/land-use-governance-documents/land-use-plan

WESBROOK PLACE NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING
In 2011, The Wesbrook Place Neighbourhood Plan was amended to bring it into alignment with revisions to the Land Use Plan, including transfer of residential development entitlement from the future housing reserve that had applied to UBC Farm and environs, as well as a primary school site, to Wesbrook Place. Other issues addressed through the process included reconfiguring road access to UBC Farm and preserving tree habitat associated with an eagle’s nest. http://planning.ubc.ca/sites/planning.ubc.ca/files/images/projects-consultations/consultations/South%20Campus%20%20Amendments%20Open%20House%20Report_FINAL.pdf.

CENTRE FOR SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS AT UBC FARM
http://ubcfarm.ubc.ca/
The Land Use Plan amendments also designate the UBC Farm as “green academic” land use (Section 4.1.2), which is defined as academic lands that will be kept primarily as open areas to support land-based teaching, research, and community engagement. The Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm contains 24 hectares of field and forest lands and encompasses a rich mosaic of cultivated field areas, hedgerows, orchards, and successional forest stands. The diversity of the landscape provides valuable habitat for a range of birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles not found elsewhere in the city. Independent inventories have identified 92 bird species at the UBC Farm site as of 2011, including 15 not seen in the adjacent Pacific Spirit Park. 

The Building Biodiversity on the Urban Edge: Enhancing Habitat at UBC Farm project conducted in 2014 aims to enhance native pollinator forage and biodiversity where agriculture and urban landscapes intersect. As a working farm in a peri-urban environment, the biodiversity at UBC Farm is affected by both neighbouring urban development and on-site agricultural land use. The project explores how we can produce healthy food, develop thriving, engaged communities while ensuring responsible stewardship of our environment, all within the context of competing land uses.

The largest of these protected areas is the more than 300 acre Hill Campus Ecological Study Area located within an even larger 800 acre largely undeveloped upper Strawberry Creek watershed.  

In addition to this large area of native forested land there are three set-aside Natural Areas on the Central Campus, the riparian corridor following Codornices Creek within the boundary of University Village, Albany, and finally, the coastal prairie and tidal marsh of the Berkeley Global Campus within the nearby city of Richmond, CA.

Upper Strawberry Creek Watershed and Ecological Study Area, Berkeley and Oakland Hills- this area of over 800 acres represents several unique ecosystems of the San Francisco Bay/East Bay; both Oak/Bay Laurel riparian forests and North Coast Scrub plant and animal communities are found here.
Central Campus Natural Areas- these three set-aside glades within the campus proper hold remnant Oak/Bay Laurel riparian plant and animal communities along with Coast Redwood forest elements (primarily mature trees with some native understory plantings).
Codornices Creek at University Village, Albany – this creek is both representative of an East Bay creek riparian community but also supports a small but resilient run of threatened Steelhead trout as well as other native fish populations (stickleback and roach).
Berkeley Global Campus, Richmond- this University land contains remnant coastal upland prairie (rare native grasses and forbs) and a restored tidal marshland.

",True,True,"Each of the above listed areas has received repeated assessments to identify endangered and vulnerable species of concern; for example, the Upper Strawberry Creek Watershed is designated habitat for the federally listed Alameda Whipsnake.  As mentioned, Codornices Creek is habitat for the threatened Northern California Steelhead and at the Berkeley Global Campus, Richmond, the endangered Ridgeway’s Rail, a marsh bird, continues to sustain a small breeding population under UC Berkeley protective efforts.

UC Berkeley continues to assess its lands to identify environmentally sensitive areas, as both part of its ongoing planning process as well as in response to changing environmental factors such as prolonged drought and climate change.

Frequent visits to these areas by qualified personnel (primarily Campus researchers and staff from the UC Berkeley Office of Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) are the primary means of assessment. However in the course of updating planning documents or complying with the CEQA process for large scale project, the University may contract with consulting biologists and other subject matter experts on a particular species of concern. Methodology centers primarily around visual and auditory (bird calls) surveys.",See above.,"Codornices Creek at University Village, Albany – this creek is both representative of an East Bay creek

One program, the Strawberry Creek Restoration Program (SCRP), is a student led effort to both protect and restore watershed natural spaces, where guidance and instruction is provided by staff from the Office of EH&S.  Over the last two decades, University students have transformed natural areas overwhelmed by invasive plant species back into biodiverse native plant communities thereby bringing back the basis of unique Northern California ecosystems and food webs.

UCI sustains a broad range of sensitive species and habitats, including multiple threatened and endangered species in areas set aside in perpetuity.

In particular, UCI provided leadership in the establishment of the first coupled Natural Communities Conservation Plan (NCCP) program and Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) reserve in the U.S., the Nature Reserve of Orange County (www.occonservation.org). The Reserve permanently protects more than 38,000 acres of regionally important habitat, including 135 acres on the UCI campus. The Reserve provides long-term preservation and management for sensitive species and their critical habitats, including the protection of 33 state and federally recognized threatened and endangered species.  The Reserve is managed by the Natural Communities Coalition (NCC), a 19-member non-profit consisting of private landowners, public agencies, state and federal wildlife agencies, and a public research university (UCI).  The 20-year-old NCCP Reserve has served as a national model for collaboration for the protection, management, and restoration of critical habitats.  UCI continues to provide leadership in stewardship, operations, and science in the ongoing management of this expansive reserve, holding a place on the Board of Directors, the executive committee, and the technical advisory committee.  UCI contributes to the monitoring and adaptive management activities, aligns basic research with local biodiversity needs, and provides capacity to the many short-term projects required to successfully conserve biological diversity in open-space interspersed as a mosaic with urban lands containing > 5 million people. During this period UCI has been instrumental in leading numerous Natural Community Coalition habitat restoration projects, biological monitoring efforts, and biodiversity research programs.

In recent years, UCI has led to the establishment of the Borrego Stewardship Council (see below for land details), which is a community-based leadership group consisting of the major stakeholders in the Borrego Springs Valley, where UCI operates a field research station in collaboration with the largest state park in California, Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.  The Council is the principal public voice and sounding group for conservation and sustainability-related topics for a location that is highly dependent on biological diversity to maintain a localized economy, which is part of UNESCO’s Mojave and Colorado Desert Biosphere Reserve.  The Council provides comment and input to the governing framework for conservation in the Borrego region, which occurs through the East County Multiple Species Conservation Program Plan (out of San Diego County).

Parcel Details
•	The 135-acre UCI NCCP reserve areas (which includes the 62-acre UCI Ecological Preserve) on the UCI main campus protects and manages critical upland habitat for many threatened and sensitive species as part of the regional NCCP Reserve.  The Preserve consists of coastal sage scrub, cactus scrub and grassland habitats, and it currently sustains multiple nesting pairs of the federally listed as threatened California gnatcatcher and the state-recognized sensitive species, coastal cactus wren.  In addition, there are a number of sensitive plant species, such as Dudleya multicaulis, which have various state and federal designations that are dependent upon this habitat type. 
•	The 202-acre UC Natural Reserve System’s San Joaquin Marsh Reserve is embraced by the UCI main and north campus lands and includes a variety of wetland habitats.  It represents one of the few remaining remnants of marsh habitat remaining in Orange County.  Along the Pacific Flyway, the marsh is a stopping place for more than 100 migratory bird species, and it sustains an equivalent number of resident species. The marsh provides habitat for numerous sensitive species including the Least Bell’s Vireo (endangered; nesting), California gnatcatcher (threatened; nesting), Ridgway’s rail (endangered; visitation and occasional nesting), the California Least Tern (endangered), and it serves as an important educational and research resource for the University.  The Marsh Reserve supports the largest natural population of the Pacific pond turtle, a sensitive species with more than 200 individuals inhabiting the site.
•	The Steele/Burnand Anza-Borrego Desert Research Center is a 78-acre site contiguous with ~400,000 acres of designated wilderness and protected lands consisting of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in northern San Diego County. Located within the Sonoran Desert, the site contains a variety of plant and animal species native to the region and is home to a wealth of geologic, hydrologic, and paleonologic resources of world-wide renown.  These lands are also part of the larger UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserve System.
•	The 306-acre Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve is located in the western Mojave Desert near Joshua Tree National Park. Habitats within the reserve include pinon-juniper woodland, Joshua tree woodland, montane chaparral, desert wash, and a freshwater seep.

Across all of these sites, and in the adjacent conservation lands (either city, county, state or federal lands), UCI provides research capacity through the Center for Environmental Biology, where staff maintain relationships with local land managers that allows for easy faculty integration with conservation needs on the ground. As such, UCI works collaboratively with State Parks, U.S. and California Fish and Wildlife, Orange County Parks, The Nature Conservancy, and non-profit land management organizations, such as the Irvine Ranch Conservancy in the protection and monitoring of habitat.

The UCI Ecological Reserve is legally protected under state and federal law as part of the regional NCCP/HCP reserve program.   The UCI Reserve and other areas of the NCCP/HCP reserve provide critical habitat to support regional biodiversity and conservation of multiple legally protected species.  These lands are held in conservation status in perpetuity, with financial resources committed from multiple entities to maintain their status into the foreseeable future. 

The UC San Joaquin Marsh Reserve is a state and federally protected wetland area sustaining an important regional wetland habitat.  The Burns and the Anza Reserves both provide a protected research and teaching template for colleges and universities throughout the state.  Anza is managed in partnership with the state park, where adjacent lands are held in wilderness status.

",True,True,"Each of these parcels were initially assessed through state and federal mechanisms for designating sensitive habitat (see NCCP and HCP description above), in collaboration with local experts on specific species, habitat, and policy.  UCI is implementing the monitoring and assessment plan for the Nature Reserve of Orange County, inclusive of the on-campus parcel and the entire Reserve.  This includes repeated site visits, detailed community assessment, interactions with consultants on specific monitoring of key species, integration of new technologies, such as remote sensing and genetic techniques in the environment, and synthesis exercises through meetings and modeling.  Our goal as an institution is to take our specific stewardship mission and leverage it to have a regional impact on adjacent habitat, collaborating extensively with our regional partners.  Over the last 20 years, this has included multiple campuswide assessments of environmentally sensitive habitat and numerous efforts to monitor endangered and sensitive species in conjunction with state and federal agencies.  
  
During the academic year of 2014/15 UCI participated in the monitoring of multiple protected species including California Gnatcatcher and Coastal Cactus Wren, Least Bell’s Vireo, and the Pacific Pond Turtle.  UCI actively monitors more than 45 different locations throughout the Reserve, describing annual changes in habitat.  UCI maintains an experimental apparatus to evaluate the effects of climate change on the principle habitat of concern.  UCI has compiled extensive databases on sensitive species distributions and population dynamics, most recently for more than 60 species of rare plant taxa.
","The UCI Reserve areas contain a range of sensitive habitat types including coastal sage scrub, cactus scrub, California grassland/prairie, maritime scrub, wetlands, and riparian woodland.

These preserved areas provide critical habitat for many sensitive species including California gnatcatcher, coastal cactus wren, Least Bell’s Vireo, and the Pacific pond turtle; not to mention the more than 60 species of plants of concern in the region.

The coastal sage scrub habitats are broadly recognized to support an extremely high level of species diversity and endemism (species that occur in no other habitat). For example, it has the highest diversity of native bees in the U.S.  Sensitive, endemic species include the Quino checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha quino), Hermes copper butterfly (Lycaena hermes), San Diego thorn mint (Acanthomintha ilicifolia), San Diego ambrosia (Ambrosia pumila), San Diego barrel cactus (Ferocactus viridescens), San Diego pocket mouse (Perognathus fallax), Merriam kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), Stephens kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi), red-diamond rattlesnake (Crotalus ruber), San Diego banded gecko (Coleonyx variegatus abbotti), San Diego horned lizard (Phrynosoma coronatum blainvillei), California gnatcatcher (Polioptila California), and the coastal populations of the cactus wren (Campylorhyncus brunneicapillus). Currently, only 15% of the original distribution of coastal sage scrub habitat remains.

","The UCI Ecological Preserve is managed as part of California’s Natural Communities Conservation Planning (NCCP) program and the Habitat Conservation Planning (HCP) program operated through California Department of Fish and Wildlife and U.S. Fish & Wildlife.  The designated reserve is managed cooperatively with the Natural Communities Coalition (described above).

UCLA students, staff and faculty have partnered with the Santa Monica Bay Foundation to restore this section of creek with native plants. Another restoration project is being considered for an area of campus known as Sage Hill, and a high level campus committee is working on a plan for the area.

On the south of campus, the Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden (MEMBG) is a living museum, having special collections designed to assist the undergraduate teaching mission at UCLA and to augment the capability for research on campus. MEMBG serves as a long-term repository for unusual plants, a refugium for biodiversity. This facility offers its educational content to the campus community, residents of Los Angeles, and visitors from around the world to enhance learning about plants and promote greater appreciation for relevance of plants to society.

Off campus, the UCLA Stunt Ranch Santa Monica Mountains Reserve forms one of 39 ecological reserves operated by the University of California Natural Reserve System (NRS), and is the only reserve managed by UCLA .The NRS network of reserves spread across all parts of California provides venues for world-class research and education in the environmental sciences, and is a unique resource unparalleled anywhere else in the world.

Also in the Santa Monica Mountains, the La Kretz Field Station is a unique, collaborative project between the UCLA La Kretz Center and the National Park Service. The location is ideal for facilitating students and visitors alike to work on collaborative conservation projects in the Santa Monica Mountains and across Southern California. The Field Station provides a natural bridge between our more laboratory-based activities on the UCLA campus and collaborative ecological work in the field. The La Kretz Center for Conservation Science helps preserve California’s biodiversity and ecosystems through research, education and public programs. They supply the scientific research needed to inform management actions to protect and restore California’s fragile biodiversity resources.

In the Owens Valley, UCLA Manages the White Mountains Research Center, which consists of four research stations located along a 10,000-foot elevational gradient. Owens Valley Station, located in the town of Bishop, lies within the transition zone between the Sierra Nevada to the west and the Basin and Range biogeographical province to the east. Surrounded by semiarid scrubland and riparian woodland, it provides a base for year-round research in the region. Roughly 6,000 feet higher and 1.5 hours of driving time away are the log walls of Crooked Creek Station, sited amidst montane woodland and sagebrush hills. Nearby grow two groves of bristlecone pine that include the oldest trees in the world. Higher still are Barcroft Station, surrounded by alpine fellfield and sporadic permafrost above treeline, and Summit Station, subject to extreme solar radiation and fierce winds.

",True,True,See website,See website,"The Stone Canyon Creek restoration project has been ongoing since 2006 with the goal of restoring the creek to a healthy, functioning, native riparian habitat.  Decades ago, the creek was routed underground and today only the small segment running through the University Lab School campus and behind the Anderson School of Management remains above ground.  Over the years, the creek site became overun by invasive plants that provided lower value habitat for native birds and other wildlife species. 

The restoration work began as a collaboration between the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA Facilities and Heal the Bay.  Starting in 2008, the project has been spearheaded by Santa Monica Baykeeper, an organization that has conducted river and coastal restoration projects that have helped to improve water quality and viable habitats in the watersheds of the Los Angeles Basin.

The restoration process involves manually removing non-native vegetation and weeds and, once the areas are cleared, planting appropriate native riparian vegetation.  In Phase 1 of the project, the 600ft reach of creek located behind the Anderson School of Management, 15 non-native trees were removed to make room for the 53 new native trees that were planted.  In total, over 1,750 native plants consisting of 37 different species have been installed along the banks of the creek.

This work has been accomplished almost entirely by volunteers.  Between April 2008 and March 2010, Santa Monica Baykeeper organized 20 individual volunteer events with nearly 900 volunteers donating 2,387 work hours.  Volunteers were recruited from various UCLA student groups, faculty, and alumni, community members and other Los Angeles area colleges and high schools.

Through the years, support and funding for the project, over $200,000 in total, has been provided by: Switzer Foundation, Southern California Wetlands Recovery Projects Small Grant Program, CA State Coastal Conservancy, Heal the Bay, Santa Monica Baykeeper, Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission, UCLA Facilities and UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.

The campus is now partnering with Baykeeper, the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission and UCLA Lab School to continue restoration efforts in Phase 2, the area upstream on the Lab School campus. The section of the creek that runs through the elementary school campus provides a unique learning experience as an outdoor laboratory and will educate students about ecological relationships and the importance of habitat diversity.

Summary of methodologies:California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii; CRLF)--surveys by consultants Jones and Stokes in 2002 and Ecosystem West in 2000. Field survyes to determine breeding, upland, and movement habitats. The suitability of aquatic features for CRLF was determined based on site conditions such as water quality, depth of ponding, duration of ponding, presence of exotic fish or bullfrogs, and proximity to known occurrences. The hydrology of sites without visible water was determined based on clues such as vegetation, soil moisture, debris location, high-water marks, the presence of dried algae, and other features. All aquatic sites were evaluated as to whether they could support CRLF breeding, foraging, or resting (temporary use). The suitability of upland habitat for use by CRLF was based on vegetation, topography, distance from known occurrences, the presence of small mammal burrows, soil cracks, debris piles, or other features that could provide aestivation habitat or temporary refuge for CRLF. Potential movement routes on campus were determined based on the locations of known breeding sites, suitable aquatic sites, suitable upland habitat, and the presence of barriers or hazards to CRLF dispersal. Barriers to dispersal are defined as features that would prevent or seriously deter CRLF from crossing the feature. Examples of barriers include buildings, dense development, vertical or near-vertical cliffs, and solid fences greater than 4 feet tall. Hazards to dispersal are defined as features that present a risk of injury or mortality to CRLF. Hazards to dispersal include active roads or low-density development. All potential barriers or hazards were recorded on the topographic map in the field. Potential movement routes of CLRF to and from campus were assessed based on the known locations of breeding and non-breeding populations and habitats offsite and the suitability of upland habitat in between.
Key aquatic sites identified by this assessment were monitored every 2 weeks
from mid-February to July, 2002, to determine the approximate length of ponding and their overall suitability for CRLF.  Site assessments for CRLF have also been prepared for UCSC in conjunction with past planning activities (Ecosystems West 2000; University of California, Santa Cruz 1988; Environmental Assessment Group 2000; Jones & Stokes

This habitat is highly endangered, with less than one tenth of one percent remaining. The UHCC prairie has a high plant diversity and so is considered more valuable than other prairie properties in Texas that may be larger but do not have high plant diversity.

     ",True,True,"The land for the Coastal Center was originally a United States Army base known as Camp Wallace, which housed some 16,000 soldiers. During this time extensive land use jeopardized the original coastal ecology and by the time the university acquired the land in 1960, significant disturbance had occurred; including the introduction of invasive species. While the land was intended to serve as the site for a new campus, in 1970 the site was re-purposed to serve as an environmental field education site. It was at this point that Dr. Richard Aumann was assigned directorship of the property. With funding from over 20 federal and state agencies, and Dr. Aumann's focus on the study of invasive species, resulting publications, studies, and facility installments at the center have produced voluminous data on the biodiversity and endangered nature of the coastal prairie ecosystem.

These types of studies are ongoing and now under the direction of Dr. Steve Pennings and his postdoc Dr. Chelse Prather. A brief list of present assessments include: the impact of the Deep Water Horizon Spill on coastal biodiversity as seen through terrestrial arthropods, the impact of encroaching Chinese Tallow groves on biodiversity, and the consequences of mangrove invasion into salt marsh habitats on the Texas coast. For a thorough discussion of the methodologies involved, please visit the link below to view the published articles from the coastal center.    ","The Coastal Center itself is an identified environmentally sensitive area known as a ""coastal tallgrass prairie"" with less than one tenth of one percent of the original habitat remaining according to the United States Geological Survey Research Program. 

While much of the native animal life may not be directly threatened, studies of biodiversity and resiliency of their food webs directly gauge the ecological health of this threatened ecosystem. For example populations of Prokelisia sp. planthopper, Chaetopsis sp. fly, and Conocephalus aigialus, are not threatened, but the substrate (coastal grasses) supporting their food webs is. Thus, by generating assessments of these arthropods food webs, the Coastal Center is able to gauge the impact of various detrimental ecological events. Again, links to publications of these studies are available below. ",So long as the Coastal Center continues operations the resulting studies and environmental stewardship of this highly threatened area will continue. Perhaps one of the most long term programs to positively affect the coastal prairie habitat is the continual stocking and redistributing of seeds from threatened plant species in the center. These seeds are stored for coastal center use in replanting or distributed to both private and public entities for their use in further restorative efforts of coastal prairie across the country.

The mission of the IIC is to enhance the access and use of forest resources data for the management of forestlands in Minnesota. The statutes urge the dean of the University of Minnesota, College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, to coordinate the establishment of the IIC. In practice, the head of the University’s Department of Forest Resources serves as the IIC director of operations.

Rare Plants and Animals
Minnesota County Biological Survey—The Minnesota County Biological Survey (MCBS) began in 1987 as a systematic survey of rare biological features. The goal of the Survey is to identify significant natural areas and to collect and interpret data on the distribution and ecology of rare plants, rare animals, and natural communities.
Minnesota Natural Heritage Information System (NHIS)—The program’s goal is to identify Minnesota’s ecologically significant natural lands. It conducts inventories and research, manages data in a computer-based system, and provides technical advice on Minnesota’s native habitats and rare species. The program identifies and locates significant examples of Minnesota’s plant and animal species, plant community types, special wildlife habitats, and special geologic features.
Minnesota’s List of Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern Species—Minnesota’s Endangered Species Statute (Minnesota Statutes, Section 84.0895) requires the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MnDNR) to adopt rules designating species meeting the statutory definitions of endangered, threatened, or species of special concern. The resulting List of Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern Species is codified as Minnesota Rules, Chapter 6134. The Endangered Species Statute also authorizes the MnDNR to adopt rules that regulate treatment of species designated as endangered and threatened.  These regulations are codified as Minnesota Rules, Parts 6212.1800 to 6212.2300.
Minnesota’s List of Species in Greatest Conservation Need—A list of wildlife species in greatest conservation need (SGCN’s) shows species on the endangered, threatened, and special concern list, as well as species which are considered at risk for a variety of reasons. In general, SGCN’s are animal species whose populations are rare, declining, or vulnerable in Minnesota.","Located in the southeast corner of the University of Minnesota St. Paul campus, the Sarita Wetland is what remains of the Sarita Lake, which was drained in the 1800s."," The Sarita Wetland Restoration Project began with the creation of the former Sustainable Campus Initiative in 2000.

In addition, MU agreed to preserve 311 acres of land within the Baskett Wildlife, Research and Education Center for promoting biodiversity in compliance with the University's Sustainable Design Standards (SDG) and Climate Action Plan (CAP) goals.","Farming systems, once beneficial for bobwhite and many other wildlife species, included a diversity of habitats such as fencerows, shrubby cover, crop rotations, fallow/weedy fields, mixtures of native grasses and forbs and inefficient grain handling.
With the increase in farm size, clean and weed-free fields, and more efficient harvest practices, many farmers have been able to stay in business, but quality early successional vegetation that provide habitat for bobwhites and grassland birds has been greatly reduced.
Bradford Research Center works to implement techniques that can be used to enhance wildlife habitat on the farm. For example:
•	Farming up to the edge of a wooded draw results in a lack of edge and fencerow habitat which also resulted in poor yields.
•	Waterways and diversion channels were formed and are typically planted to tall fescue which although is an excellent guard against erosion it is not a very wildlife friendly grass.
•	Unmanaged Native Warm Season Grasses were of little use to bobwhite quail except for escape cover because of a lack of bare ground.
•	Natural prairie and wetland remnants were invaded with non-native species such as Reedcanary grass and Sericea Lespedeza which can be invasive and offer little benefit to wildlife.
•	Strip disking native warm season grasses in the fall and spring open up the understory for more beneficial forbs (non grass species) and annual grasses which allows bobwhite quail ample bare ground to move through. Anuual forbs and grasses are also a source of seed and most importantly a source of insects for baby quail chicks.
•	Fall and Spring prescribed burning help reduce the competition of the native warm season grasses and encourages forbs and annual grasses.
•	Predominance of tall fescue and little shrubby cover across much of the farm.
•	Field border/edge management around crop fields. A mixture of native grasses and forbs are planted in 30-120 borders around field edges to provide food, nesting ground, and cover for bobwhite quail and other species.

The forest is not legally protected, however, from the University’s perspective, the small forest is special because it sits inside a large urban area and yet serves as a refuge for a diversity of plant and animal species found in Piedmont-region forests of the eastern United States. The woods provide a glimpse of native oak-hickory and beech-maple forests that once covered this region of the United States. The branches of Buffalo Creek that flow through the Park are part of the headwaters of North Carolina’s Cape Fear River system (http://www.uncg.edu/reg/Catalog/0910/UnivComm/peabody.html).

To increase the diversity, in 2002 the University planted several American hollies, Carolina silverbells, deciduous Magnolias, and Eastern hemlocks. Native shrub diversity is low, including a few Strawberry Bushes and Piedmont azaleas. The diversity of Piedmont wildflowers and ferns is low and currently includes species such as: Spring Beauty, Trout Lily, Mayapple, Red Trillium, Wild Ginger, Spotted Wintergreen, and Beechdrops, which parasitize the roots of Beech trees. Some species are found only in one restricted area of the Park. Unfortunately, because of many years of neglect, invasive English Ivy and Japanese honeysuckles abound.

When the Peabody Park open area was last surveyed, it was home to native and introduced plants characteristic of central North Carolina, such as Purple Dead-Nettle, Peppervine, Bulbous Buttercup, Star of Bethlehem, Spotted Touch-me-not, Carolina Cranesbill, Daisy Fleabane, Horse-nettle, and White Clover.

Regarding the satellite locations:  OIMB manages the Metcalf Marsh, an important location for estuary research. It is part of the land-margin ecosystems that occur at the interface between steep or deltaic riverine valleys and the near shore marine waters of the Pacific Ocean and serves as a buffer between shore lands and estuarine waters, preventing or minimizing erosion, flooding and pollution. 

The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (http://www.oregon.gov/DSL/SSNERR/Pages/index.aspx) was established near OIMB in 1974 as a 5,000 acre natural area that is dedicated to scientific research, long-term monitoring, and public education about estuaries and coastal watershed habitats. Faculty members and students from OIMB played an instrumental role in the nomination and designation of SSNERR as the founding member of the national system of Reserves. The OIMB library houses baseline data used to establish the South Slough as the first National Estuarine Research Reserve, student research reports dating back to 1967, and biological inventories of local areas.  This reserve site provides critical habitat for ecologically and commercially important species of fish, shellfish, birds, and other aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Moreover, each Reserve has been designated to function as a distinct conservation unit including the preservation of core tideland communities surrounded by adjacent buffer zones, and they are afforded sufficient protection to ensure their integrity as sites for long-term monitoring and research.  

Offshore, a narrow continental shelf provides easy access to coastal waters that are characterized by a strong upwelling system with its associated nutrient-rich waters. The surrounding coastal forests include an 80-acre reserve within OIMB and a 5,000-acre reserve within the SSNERR. Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, western red cedar and western hemlock, with an understory of salal and various huckleberry species, dominates the coniferous forest. Very little old growth remains in Coos County, but the OIMB reserve has trees more than 70 years old, making it one of the oldest timber stands in the county. OIMB recognizes its role as a national resource and serves as repository for data relating to the Coos Bay estuary system and surrounding coastal region. It is a deep-draft development estuary and important commercial harbor.

The Willamette River and other water bodies have been listed as not meeting the standards for temperature and bacteria.  This requires the development of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these pollutants, and an allocation to point and non-point sources and the need to collect data. The listing of the Spring Chinook Salmon as a threatened species in the Upper Willamette River requires City of Eugene to comply with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) provisions to regulate salmon habitat in the McKenzie and Willamette Rivers.  This species is one of the most genetically distinct groups of Chinook in the Columbia River Basin. The decline in the Chinook Salmon has been attributed to such factors as destruction of habitat through channelization and revetment of river banks, non-point source pollution, alterations of natural hydrograph by increased impervious surfaces in the basin, and degradation of natural functions of riparian lands due to removal or alteration of indigenous vegetation. www.lcog.org/DocumentCenter/View/141

The UVa portion of the site is Thomas Jefferson's Academical Village - which forms the center of the UVa Grounds 1,135 acre-campus.

The UVA Foundation (UVAF) has a property adjacent to the campus (The Grounds) - historically called Foxhaven Farm that has an 86-acre conservation easement managed by UVAF.

The UVa Grounds have two priority sites for biodiversity established through our 2007 Biodiversity Analysis: Jefferson Mountain at 275-acres and the North Grounds Forest at 75 acres, which are largely maintained as natural green space. Jefferson Mountain is an established UVa research site for forest diversity enhancement.   

",True,True,"University of Virginia (UVa) selected NatureServe to assemble existing and new information to create a comprehensive biodiversity analysis of lands owned by UVa and the University of Virginia Foundation (UVaF).  This biodiversity analysis was developed to inform the UVA campus planning process.  As part of this project, NatureServe provided:

1)	This final report summarizing “conservation values” throughout the UVa and UVaF properties, suggesting conservation goals for future planning, and establishing example scenarios that examine how alternative future land use plans affect the ability to realize conservation goals. 
2)	A conservation planning tool (NatureServe Vista) for use as an ArcMap extension to develop “conservation value” summaries, modify landscape conservation goals, and create new conservation “scenarios” as new information is received. 
3)	Formal training of UVa staff on the NatureServe Vista application as well as ongoing software support services. 

NatureServe engaged expert partners to compile all existing geospatial data pertaining to potential conservation targets on UVa and UVaF lands.  In addition, NatureServe communicated with key academic, state government, and local government partners to collect new information about the status of stream quality and the potential presence and location of federally listed mussel species adjacent to UVa lands in the Rivanna River.  Finally, the team imported all elements of potential conservation value into an ArcMap project, using NatureServe Vista.

NatureServe staff communicated with dozens of experts to collect existing information on the types and distributions of conservation elements (land cover, habitat fragment size, stream quality, rare and endangered species occurrence, indicator species occurrence, soil types, etc.) within the project area.  They consulted with academics from the University of Virginia,, experts from state agencies including the Virginia Natural Heritage Program and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, and private consultants including freshwater experts from Williamsburg Environmental Group.  

The team also worked with survey and data collection groups to develop new data specific to this biodiversity analysis.  The University of Virginia was particularly interested in watershed condition analyses to inform their campus planning process; as such NatureServe commissioned  a watershed analysis along key stream reaches on University and the UVa  property and worked with the Virginia Natural Heritage Program (part of the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation) to survey the Rivanna River, focusing on rare aquatic elements such as rare mussel species.

Once the initial data gathering and organization was completed, NatureServe staff created a NatureServe Vista project to be used for the current quantitative conservation analysis and for continual future use.  For this project, Natureserve chose the most important available geospatial data layers and assigned a weighting for conservation value and data confidence to each layer based on its relative importance to conservation. This process assists in quantifying the overall conservation value throughout the landscape.  In addition, the team established introductory conservation goals for each element of conservation importance to examine whether conservation goals would be reached under the alternative land use scenarios to be determined by UVa.  This included four analyses of conservation value and one analysis of potential land use effect on biodiversity to better understand the biodiversity conservation issues facing UVa lands. 


","Key Finding 1: According to an analysis of data with the developed weighting system, the most important areas of UVA and UVAF owned lands for biodiversity value are along the Rivanna River in the North Fork tract, along certain existing stream corridors throughout the entire study area, and in the Milton Field land owned by UVA.   
Key Finding 2:Upland tracts located in or near developed areas, and away from streams, possess relatively low biodiversity values according to our analysis.  
The James Spinymussel data is species observation data.  The original observation of this record was in 1998 and was updated in 2005.  
The Atlantic Pigtoe Mussel data is species observation data.  The occurrence was documented in 1981.  ","The University has used several recent stormwater management projects to create wildlife habitat, including stream restoration and stream daylighting to create aquatic wildlife habitat. Wildlife-edible plants and other native plant species are utilized, along with minimally-invasive landscaping practices, to create areas of habitat adjacent to riparian features. Several stream restorations project have implemented strategies to reduce erosion and recreate riffles and pools to create aquatic habitat.

Monarch Waystations: Create, Conserve, & Protect Monarch Habitats

Introduction | Waystation Seed Kit | Certify Your Site | Registry | Downloads

Each fall, hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California where they wait out the winter until conditions favor a return flight in the spring. The monarch migration is truly one of the world's greatest natural wonders, yet it is threatened by habitat loss in North America - at the overwintering sites and throughout the spring and summer breeding range as well.

Monarch Waystation Habitats
Monarch Waystations are places that provide resources necessary for monarchs to produce successive generations and sustain their migration. Without milkweeds throughout their spring and summer breeding areas in North America, monarchs would not be able to produce the successive generations that culminate in the migration each fall. Similarly, without nectar from flowers these fall migratory monarch butterflies would be unable to make their long journey to overwintering grounds in Mexico. The need for host plants for larvae and energy sources for adults applies to all monarch and butterfly populations around the world.",--,--,,,"The university owns two natural areas: 22 acres of native forest land and 27 acres of marsh/swamp.  Both are maintained with minimal disturbance (e.g. single trail, trail and boardwalk for the marsh) as examples of native ecosystems, including wildlife.

The Natural Heritage Inventory identifies locations of threatened and/or endangered plants and animals throughout Wisconsin.  This inventory was consulted and no endangered resources were identified on your property.

Species of Greatest Conservation Need
Although no species on the Natural Heritage Inventory were found on the property, there are some species of conservation need that could use your property.  
The gray wolf is listed as an endangered species.  Gray wolf (Canis lupis), also referred to as timber wolf, is the largest wild members of the dog family.  Males average about 10% larger in size than females.  In addition, gray wolves have a massive head and neck important in killing prey, which results in larger fore feet than hind feet.  Body weight, height, and foot prints are important distinguishing characteristics when comparing gray wolves to other wild and domestic canids.  Wolves are social animals, living in a family group, or pack.  Pack sizes in Wisconsin average 2-6 individuals with a few packs as large as 8-10 animals.  A wolf pack's territory may cover 20-120 square miles. 
Sand Snaketail is a rare species of dragonfly.  Dragonflies occupy a variety of aquatic habitats, and tend to be either associated with flowing water, specialized wetlands such as peatlands, and specialized lake types.  Species have a life cycle of two to three years which means the predominant life stage (larvae) have to have their requirements met for long periods of time.

A Tiger Beetle is a rare species.  Tiger beetles require bare soil ranging from loose sand to packed clay.  Partial to full exposure to sunlight also is required, although some species require openings in forested landscapes.  Larvae cannot withstand excessive disturbance of the soil in which they burrow.

The Karner blue butterfly is a federally endangered species.  The caterpillar stage feeds only the leaves of lupine so the butterfly’s habitat is prairies, opening and pine and oak barrens. 

Effects of planned practices
The prescription for thinning in the oak and pine stands probably will not impact any of the above species greatly.  A conversion of the red and jack pines to white pine will add species and size class diversity, good for habitat.  Restoration of oak savanna and prairie habitat could be considered to improve habitat and food sources for some of these species.

","Work has been done, and continues to be done, on the creek flowing through campus to promote urban biodiversity, and particularly to improve the habitat for the native Bonnevile Cutthroat Trout. 

There are various areas on campus that focus on showcasing native plants, landscaping principles, and wildlife habitats: Naturescape Garden, Native American Garden, Mountain Desert Garden, Shakespeare Garden, Organic Vegetable Garden, Pollinator Garden, and Xeroscape Garden. Each garden features explanatory signs and plant species labels.

Completed in November 2005, the Westminster College Landscape Master Plan addresses the campus as a place of learning, investigation, demonstration and environmental stewardship. As part of this comprehensive look at future landscape design and development, the plan emphasizes the use of water-wise plantings which maintain the traditional feel of campus and provide learning opportunities for students and the community.",https://www.westminstercollege.edu/environmental_center/index.cfm?parent=6676&detail=6704&content=6762,--

Williams College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 08:22:52,mae3@williams.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Several areas within the forest have been identified by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as priority areas for conservation.  These include several first order stream corridors and small wooded wetlands, as well as habitats for several upland plant species, including wild ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), and crooked-stem aster (Symphiotrichum prenanthoides).  Most of the rare upland plant habitat occupies lower elevation sites with enrichment from the marble bedrock that underlies the Hoosic River Valley.  These areas tend to lie below 1200 feet in elevation.  Several small wooded ponds, (“vernal pools”) have been identified and certified with the Massachusetts Natural Heritage Program.  In the case of two of the pools, we have found a state protected (“Special Concern”) vertebrate, the Jefferson’s Salamander.  Another area of conservation interest is the Taconic Range, a ridge that frames the western flank of the property (in New York), and spans from 2100 to 2500 feet in elevation; this ridgetop harbors some more northerly species, that are not necessarily state listed, but are of conservation interest nonetheless.  We also own an enriched thermal spring and fen at the lower, opposite end of the forest, which harbors some interesting, though not “endangered” plant species.  ",True,True,"In the recent past we have monitored many of the rare species on the property including crooked-stem aster, wild ginseng, the Jefferson’s salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) using pitfall/drift fence arrays, and wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta), via radio tracking.  In addition we have monitored and in some cases managed several apparently healthy examples of American chestnut, (Castanea dentata).  Two species that we had previously studied or monitored, the Appalachian brook crayfish (Cambarus bartonii) and the Northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus), recently have been de-listed as rare species by the Commonwealth.   More recently we have been tracking an apparent expansion of breeding mourning warblers  (Oporornis philadelphia) into the higher elevations of the forest using ad-hoc surveys and point counts.  With this species and others -- including the Eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transtitionalis), and smooth green snake (Opheodrys vernalis) -- in mind, we recently created more early successional habitat in two five acre patches near the top of the Taconic Range; we intend to monitor these sites to track any changes in the numbers of these and other species of interest.","Hopkins Forest and its surrounding wooded tracts have been identified by the Nature Conservancy and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as priority core forest habitat through their BioMap program.  In terms of forest stand level research, we have been monitoring 400 permanent vegetation plots, some going back to the 1930s (originally established by the U.S. Forest Service).  These plots are all surveyed on an approximate 15 year rotation and this allows us to detect changes in the forest composition over time; track declines and gains on the species level; and make climate related correlations with these and other biometric variables.
Additionally, annual breeding bird point counts in June allow us to monitor trends in many species of forest interior (and edge) songbirds; we have identified more than 50 breeding species in the forest and in excess of 125 bird species that use the forest on a year-round basis.  In collaboration with local birding groups, we conduct annual Christmas bird counts and spring migration counts that help us to keep track of avian populations beyond the breeding season.","In terms of invasive species:  we have a long-term study that targets the population dynamics of garlic mustard (Allaria petiolata) at three sites in the forest.  We are looking at the interplay between this introduced biennial and some native herbs that grow in its midst.   In some cases, where it does not interfere with ongoing research and is deemed manageable, we have taken measures to remove invasive species,  primarily Asian shrub honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.), Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), buckthorns (Rhamnus spp.) and Eurasian bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus).   We are also keeping our eye on apparent incipient invaders, most notably Norway maple (Acer platanoides); we are determined to keep this weedy tree away from native stands of sugar maple where feasible. 
On the ecostystem level, we have identified several sensitive or locally uncommon habitats -- including a dry chestnut oak stand, rich marble outcrops, high elevation heaths, and the aforementioned wooded pools and fen.   In some cases we have begun to target these areas for management or protection, e.g. prescribed fire on the oak site, and possible control of Phragmites near the fen.  Indeed, the main impetus for a recent ten acre land acquisition along our southern boundary was the protection of two wetlands of high value for Jefferson salamanders and other breeding amphibians.  We certainly have a keen interest in maintaining and enhancing the biodiversity of Hopkins Forest and are poised to take the steps necessary to do so.
