Our students and faculty mentors are working with facilities personnel to recertify a LEED Certified building on campus using the protocols of Existing Building Operations and Maintenance. (EBOM),"The students have identified the certification protocols sanctioned by the US Green Building Council which can be applied to such recertification of a high-performing LEED Certified campus building. They have worked with facilities personnel to identify the performance data for the last several years on the operation and maintenance of the selected building.

They have mapped a set of recommendations for implementation by the university’s facilities personnel to improve the energy and water conservation performance of this building so as to meet recertification standards of LEED EBOM.

This program was originated by the US Green building Council Center for Green Schools and Ball State University was one of the early signatories to the program. We have a long standing memorandum of understanding with the USGBC and will continue to expand the application of this technique to other buildings on campus.

The opportunity enables students of differing disciplinary backgrounds to work in collaborative teams to assess, evaluate and recommend the appropriate mitigation/intervention strategies for improving building operation performance while meeting the needs of building occupants.

Working with facilities personnel, the students get first-hand, real-world experience in communicating in the language of metrics that supersede the jargon of disciplinary interest; they develop professional reporting, presentation and documentation skills to supplement their routine academic training; and they learn the skills of team-based collaboration.

This not only equips the students to take leadership positions with future employers but to stand out in the competitive job market as someone with not only a degree in their disciplinary area but also as someone with practical experience that has been vetted on the national stage.

Students in the course were given the task of siting, sizing, and installing the array from start to finish. Their first step was to break into five groups, with each group analyzing a different site on the property and creating a proposal. 

The proposals were pitched via powerpoint presentations to Steve Katona and William Osborn of the nonprofit group MDI Clean Energy Partners (MDI CEP). Clean Energy Partners then chose one proposal and the class came together to manage all aspects of the installation.

Students selected solar panels and inverters, completed the appropriate paperwork for permits and net metering, and negotiated a power purchase agreement with MDI CEP. Finally, students installed a 10-panel array at the farm, rated at a 2.5 kW power capacity.

The Practicum in Renewable Energy is a hands-on, project-based class in which students collaboratively plan for and oversee all aspects of a renewable energy project. Students learn how to take a project from design through fruition while navigating the various phases of the project life cycle including operation and maintenance. As part of this planning process, students learn about the economics of renewable energy systems, including return on investment, internal rate of return, and related quantities. The practicum gives students the skills necessary to conceptualize, plan for, finance, and implement renewable energy projects.

Faculty and staff have the opportunity to engage with each other building the CC community. This event not only builds community but hopes to be a positive event for the mental health and stress of everyone working at the college. The nature of the block plan often results in high stress and lack of time for faculty and staff to get together and converse. Beer with the Chaplains is an institutionalized time for de-stressing and congratulating everyone for making it through the block.  ,"Beer with the Chaplains builds community. Faculty and staff are often too busy to truly get to know everyone in the community, and this is a setting to build relationships and friendships. Faculty, staff, and administration are all invited and because of this a greater sense of an entire community is fostered at the college. Members of the college feel appreciated and congratulated on their tireless schedules. Additionally, a local pub in Colorado Springs is supported by the college showing our preference for local business.

The Adult Learner and Veteran Services office supports increased academic achievement and holistic development for all adult learners, including but not limited to veterans and student parents, resulting in graduation from CSU and sustainable personal and professional success. We do this through engagement and leadership opportunities, community building, and resource facilitation. For a full list of exceptional programs, see the attached letter. A few highlights:
- The ALVS office has been in existence since 2009 and was built on the Resources for
Adult Learners/Non-Traditional Student programs previously organized within Off
Campus Life.
- CSU applied for and earned one of twenty $100,000 American Council on Education/Wal-Mart Foundation Success for Veterans Grant in 2009 which supported the establishment of the office and SALUTE Veterans National Honor Society. Since inception, ALVS has been supported by students via student fees (now at $6.76).
- ALVS continues to host SALUTE headquarters, supporting operations of multiple
chapters and 4,500 students nation-wide.
- Since 2013 ALVS office has partnered with the State of Colorado – Department of Labor
and Employment to host a full-time Veteran’s Employment Representative.
- On October 30-31, the first-ever Veteran's Symposium was held on campus with 29 sessions and several keynote speakers. ","CSU's adult learner cohort has seen a 3.3% increase during the 2010-2013 time frame and a 89.6% increase in the number of student veterans during that time.

CSU has fully participated in the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Yellow Ribbon GI
Enhancement Program since 2011, providing 50% of the cost of the difference between
in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees while the VA covers in-state tuition and the
remaining 50%.

CSU has been designated a Military Friendly institution by GI Jobs® for the past 5 years, placing in the top 15% of universities doing the most to support veterans returning to college.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/326/6/585/3285/ALVS%20STARS%20Letter.pdf,**,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,http://alvs.colostate.edu/,--

Emory University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 16:26:42,ciannat.howett@emory.edu,2.0,Pursuing,TruCost: Sustainable Procurement & Tracking Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Emory University’s Supply Chain ,"Thanks to a push from large corporations such as Wal-Mart, many corporations are tracking the greenhouse gas emissions of their supply chain. Knowledge of supply chain is essential for developing sustainable procurement practices. However, most of higher education, and particularly schools in the Southeast, has not begun to track their supply chain emissions and tools are not readily available to conduct this analysis.
However, in 2010-2011, Emory University’s Office of Sustainability and Office of Procurement and Contract Administration developed a partnership with a third-party, Trucost, to analyze the carbon footprint of the University’s supply chain. Trucost was selected to conduct this analysis because of their experience conducting supply chain greenhouse gas inventories for corporations internationally and because they have been the research partner responsible for assessing companies' environmental performance for Newsweek's annual Green Rankings.
Trucost conducted a spend analysis to identify over 200 of Emory’s high impact suppliers with the greatest potential to reduce Emory’s supply chain footprint and invited each supplier to provide information through its online supplier engagement portal. Companies that had not previously calculated their carbon footprint were invited to provide expenditure data related to fuel, electricity and business travel, which Trucost converted to carbon footprint data. Trucost verified the data and also provided a help desk service to support Emory’s suppliers in providing accurate information.
During the first year of the initiative, 46 suppliers, representing 90% of the University’s supply chain carbon footprint, provided information about their greenhouse gas emissions to Trucost. Around half of these suppliers had not previously calculated their carbon footprint. Emory’s direct engagement with these suppliers pushed them to calculate their carbon footprint for the very first time which helped these suppliers develop a better understanding of the environmental impact of their industry.
Emory is currently evaluating how to best utilize the information gathered through this process, and how to work with our suppliers toward decreasing carbon emissions through the products that Emory purchases.
Emory University is one of the largest higher education purchasers in the Southeast and recognizes the importance of understanding the impact of our supply chain. Emory’s work to analyze the carbon footprint of university spending is directly impacting suppliers’ awareness of their emissions and will hopefully inspire other institutions within higher education to begin tracking the carbon footprint of their own supply chains.
In addition to the partnership with Trucost, Emory is working towards sustainable procurement as a founding member of the Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council (SPLC) whose mission is to support and recognize purchasing leadership that accelerates the transition to a prosperous and sustainable future. In this role, Emory is helping to advise and create systems for more sustainable purchasing with corporate and university partners.

The supply would be purchased on a long-term contract for differences.   Final negotiations are in progress.  For out efforts the consortium has won the first annual Boston Green Ribbon Commission's Renewable Energy Prize.  The prize carries a cash award of $100,000 which will largely go to Tufts with about 5-10% to Endicott (based on the size of our electric load).   

The prize, funded by the Barr Foundation, was awarded to the consortium who developed the best strategy for large-scale renewable energy.  Our proposal uses wind energy from New Hampshire to provide a long-term hedge for a portion of our wholesale power purchases.

George Washington University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 13:04:35,shannonross@gwu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,DC Climathon at GW,"In 2015, student and citizen innovators in nineteen cities around the world participated in the first global Climathon to develop solutions to their cities’ climate change challenges. A dozen teams of young innovators hailing from six continents met in Paris in December 2015 to pitch the resulting technological and social innovations to address climate change at the UN’s COP21 climate conference. The young innovators, from countries as diverse as Australia, Brazil, China, England, and Ethiopia pitched their ideas at a special session in central Paris. Teams from 20 major cities participated in a 24-hour long “climathon” on June 18, 2015 to develop initial concepts.

The DC Climathon was held at GW in partnership with the District of Columbia Department of Energy & Environment, which identified the city climate challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through addressing food waste and loss, as well as hunger in the city. Following 24 hours of intensive collaboration, a jury of experts
selected the best ideas. Over the following six months, business mentors, urban experts, and social entrepreneurship advisors cultivated the teams and their ideas, ultimately selecting one viable start-up to go to Paris.

Representing the United States in the global competition, the DC Climathon addressed the District of Columbia’s climate challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as food waste and loss, and hunger in the city. As stated by the World Resources Institute (WRI), according to a study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FA), food loss and waste accounts for about 3.3 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, which would only be exceeded by China and the United States in scale of emissions.  Also according to WRI, the world currently faces a 70 percent gap between the crop calories produced today and those that will be needed to feed a projected population of more than 9.5 billion people in 2050. The DC Climathon posed a challenge in 2015 to identify solutions that address both the climate impact and the nutritional gap: “How can public-private partnerships reduce food waste/loss generated by the District of Columbia’s residential or commercial sectors?”  

Raw Food Rescue was selected as the winning social entrepreneurial venture from the DC Climathon. Raw Food Rescue is a logistics management public-private partnership focused on redistributing food resources to reduce food waste and divert emissions that contribute to climate change, while providing food to the hungry. The idea utilizes an app for volunteer food rescuers to deliver leftovers from retail outlets to food banks, and gain points and rewards for their participation. ","- More than 30 innovators joined the 24-hour hackathon at for the DC Climathon at GW.
- Cities from nineteen countries around the world conducted a Climathon at that same time. 
- These cities each now have a new start-up addressing climate change solutions.
- In Washington, D.C. the winning team, Raw Food Rescue, will begin to pilot its efforts in 2016. After that time, the outcomes of the start-up will begin to become clearer. 
- The DC Climathon has led to enhanced relationships and joint-efforts between the District and the university. It shows that universities and cities can work together to develop climate change solutions.

Hampshire College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 09:59:18,bhooker@hampshire.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Solar Photovoltaic Arrays—Plan to generate up to 100% of electricity,"Solar Photovoltaic Arrays—Plan to generate up to 100% of electricity

In 2007, the College signed the Presidential Climate Commitment, which includes our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2032.   Through the Climate Action Plan, we have identified many pathways toward this goal, including renewable energy, demonstrating how the pursuit of carbon neutrality enhances the mission of the College.

In February 2015, the Hampshire College Board of Trustees approved a plan to generate nearly 90% of our electricity from ground-mounted solar arrays, with a goal to reach 100% through additional panels on rooftops, parking lot canopies, and research-oriented panels on active farmland.  

As part of this on-site solar project, we are working to develop strategies that maintain and enhance ecosystem services, promote research and education, and provide the solar industry with a new paradigm to inspire land stewardship, societal responsibility, and beauty.  In addition, soils under PV arrays will be preserved at the minimum, and ideally improved, for potential future agricultural use, through methods that increase organic matter storage, soil biodiversity, and nutrient levels.

Finally, we believe that our choice to generate clean energy on-campus will help to reduce the impacts of extractive industries, including hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) for natural gas, construction of new pipelines, effects of oil spills, and destruction of mountain-tops for coal mining.  

On site solar may supply nearly 100% of electricity to the campus.  Hampshire College is working through regulatory and feasibility studies with a team of solar experts, including Solar City, Solar Design Associates, and Gerhlicher Solar.  Through a power purchase agreement, Hampshire College anticipates significant annual savings on its utility bill.  Some of these savings will be earmarked for energy efficiency projects as well as for academic research.  

Our Commitments:
•	Through the Presidential Climate Commitment and our Climate Action Plan, Hampshire College is committed to achieving carbon neutrality and demonstrating how the pursuit of carbon neutrality enhances the mission of the College.
•	By generating locally-produced, clean energy on-campus, we are consciously choosing to reduce impacts of fracking, pipelines, oil spills, mountain-top removal coal mining, and nuclear power in someone else’s backyard.
•	Hampshire College will develop strategies that promote co-existence of renewable energy with agricultural land use that will be a valuable model for landowners in the region. We will explore opportunities to maintain and enhance ecosystem services, promote research and education, and provide the solar industry with a new paradigm to inspire land stewardship, societal responsibility, and beauty.
•	Hampshire College will strive to meet two complementary goals: “Sustainable Food, Produced Right Here” and “Sustainable Energy, Produced Right Here”.
 


","Guiding Principles for Developing PV Arrays on Campus:
•	Every phase of the project, from evaluating potential PV sites to long-term monitoring of ecosystems, will be educational for the community.
•	Evaluation of sites for potential solar arrays will include assessment of current land use, future opportunities, and value to the campus community for other purposes, including to recreation, agriculture, serenity, and wildlife habitat.
•	PV arrays will be designed and constructed to preserve or improve ecosystem services, such as improving soils, increasing biodiversity, providing habitat buffers and corridors, improving water quality, and enhancing wildlife habitat.
•	Soils under PV arrays will be preserved at the minimum, and ideally improved, for potential future agricultural use, through methods that increase organic matter storage, soil biodiversity, and nutrient levels.
•	The PV project will provide substantial savings in terms of reduced future energy costs with no financial outlay from the College.
•	A designated portion of the cost savings will be used to support campus sustainability projects, such as the Sustainable Revolving Fund (SURF) and student and faculty research projects.
•	Project development and construction will be closely monitored by an appointed committee comprised of students, staff, and faculty members to ensure above goals are met.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/713/6/585/3285/AASHE%20STARS%20Letter%20Support%20for%20Solar%20innovation.pdf,**,True,True,True,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,https://www.hampshire.edu/sustainable/hampshire-college-solar-project,--
Harvard University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 16:59:08,colin_durrant@harvard.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Food Donation Partnership with Local Nonprofit,"Harvard University is proud to continue its partnership with Food for Free, a local non-profit that reduces food waste, and works to address chronic hunger by rescuing fresh food – food that might otherwise go to waste – and redistributing it to more than 100 local food pantries and emergency food organizations where it can quickly get those who need it most.

During 2015, Harvard donated more than 40,000 pounds of healthy food. Given that the average meal is 1.3 pounds, this translates to approximately 30,000 donated meals to local individuals in need.

This partnership first launched at Harvard’s Farmers' Market in 2012 when Food for Free started to collect food donated by vendors at the end of the market, but was formalized and expanded late last year. Currently, Harvard donates between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds of food per month.

To ensure that breakfast, lunch, and dinner are available for all 6,600 undergraduates on a daily basis, Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) regularly has food that is not consumed or touched. In the past, excess fresh food was composted. But the partnership with Food for Free ensures that the untouched food is instead rescued and provided to those in need.

“The food from Harvard is very healthy, easy to reheat, and simple to serve. None of it has to be cooked from scratch, which is not only time-consuming, but oftentimes not possible as some of our recipients live in motels or on the street where cooking options don’t exist. This is a new way of doing food redistribution and it has really been making a difference in the battle on hunger,” said Sasha Purpura, executive director of based Food for Free.
“This program further demonstrates Harvard’s interest in partnering with providers in the community to create innovative efforts to support local families,” said Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications. “This is a wonderful example of what can happen when local organizations work together to address an important community need.”

The initiative builds on Harvard’s long commitment of community engagement, which includes extensive partnerships with local schools and creating and preserving affordable housing.","During 2015, Harvard donated more than 40,000 pounds of healthy food.

This group is committed to a democratic forum of open dialogue and community building, and strives for systemic, structural, change-based approaches to injustice. The group aims to address salient issues of race, class, gender, and other inequalities in the Geneva community. 

Tools for Social Change emerged in the fall of 2014 as many of the Black Lives Matter protests took place across the nation. Faculty in the HWS Philosophy and Education departments, along with staff in the Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning (CCESL) office, created a unique service-learning and community dialogue initiative to help address the nationally reaching issues.

Since February 2015, a diverse group of Genevans have met weekly (more than 150 people have participated at least once). First, the group went through six weeks of intergroup dialogue in order to explore issues of race, class, and white privilege. Then the group identified action areas they wanted to pursue. There are now, at the grassroots level, several vibrant all-volunteer working groups addressing political representation, food deserts and nutrition, community relations, and other emerging ideas. Participants have included the Mayor of Geneva, several current city councilors, citizens running for City Council, the police chief, staff from the Office of Neighborhood Initiatives, members of the local NAACP, City Comprehensive Plan Committee members, and other community leaders. Participants of all ages and background have begun important community building work through the innovative group known as Tools for Social Change.

Two of the most notable accomplishments from this group include impact on both city politics and policy making. First, the local election for all City Councilor seats and Mayor took place over fall 2015, but limited public debates or other means by which citizens could learn about candidates in person were scheduled. Tools for Social Change identified this lack of transparency in city politics and led the coordination, planning, and hosting of multiple non-partisan candidates’ nights events. Secondly, the City of Geneva is currently updating its Comprehensive Plan to help guide the path of City government for the next 10-15 years. However, many people throughout the City did not know about the process, and the Comprehensive Plan Committee was struggling with how to receive feedback from diverse groups throughout the city. Tools for Social Change advocated for increased participation in the Comprehensive Planning process and the Comprehensive Plan Committee agreed to partner. The two groups decided to hold and record dialogue circles community wide. These dialogue circles, called “Big Talk in the Little City,” asked specific questions about residential, commercial, public, and occupational spaces and land usage in Geneva. The concerns and ideas gleaned from these dialogues have informed the city comprehensive planning process, as well as the policy decisions elected leaders will make for the next 10-15 years. Developing themes of interest and action areas from the dialogues thus far include:
•	public funding and human resources for a civil service exam tutoring and mentoring program for persons of color
•	allocation of at least 2-3 paid employment positions in city government to people of color
•	working with the City of Geneva to organize and support a city-wide tenants’/renters association to advocate for fair housing practices
•	working with the City of Geneva to organize for and support the creation of a resident owned healthy food co-op grocery store in the 6th Ward
•	working with the City of Geneva to push the Regional Transit System (RTS) to increase the number of food bags allowed on the bus from 2 to at least 3

Tools for Social Change is an innovative initiative that started with an idea for deeper community dialogue about challenging issues. It has blossomed into a creative, diverse, robust, and influential group of concerned citizens advocating for positive change in their city. Tools for Social Change will continue to evolve and adapt to current issues and areas of need in order to improve the quality of life for the residents of the City of Geneva, visitors, and those in the surrounding area.

Indiana University Bloomington,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 09:44:08,brownwm@indiana.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Sustainability and the Greek Experience,"At Indiana University Bloomington, there are over 5,000 students and 65 organizations involved in Greek Life, including 32 fraternities and 23 sororities. Our effort to improve the sustainability of those organizations is called the “Indiana University Green Greek Certification Program"", an annual point system through which housed fraternities and sororities document and be rewarded for their sustainability efforts. Based on the number of points earned in a given year, fraternities and sororities can achieve different levels of certification: green engaged, green proficient, and green certified. The certification system consists of over 80 items in the categories waste, energy and water, community engagement, and innovation. 

In the last 2 years, the IU Office of Sustainability has been working with the Panhellic Council (PHA) and the Intrafraternity Council (IFC) at IU to generate an institutional structure that can allow the system to work. As of spring 2015, all housed chapters have a designated Sustainability Chair. The chairs will be responsible for implementing the certification system within their houses. To become certified, each Sustainability Chair must submit their certification checklist in the Spring (mid April) of the academic year with the signature of the chapter Sustainability Chair and the chapter President. Before attaining certification, these documents will be reviewed by IUOS staff. For certain items (often high point value items), the chair will also be required to submit documentation (e.g. electricity bills for the chapter). The certification system has been vetted and approved by IFC, PHA, the Senior Associate Director for Student Life and Learning, and by the IU Director of Sustainability. 

We expect to certify chapters in the Spring of 2016 based on their activities in the 2015-2016 academic year. In preparation for this, in the Spring of 2015, all sustainability chairs were invited to a “Green Greek networking” night at the E-House, home to the IU Office of Sustainability. At the event, 39/41 sustainability chairs for the housed Greek chapters attended and learned about the certification system. A similar event will take place in the early fall of 2015 to jump-start implementation of the system for 2015-2016.",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/81/6/585/3285/IN%204%20Greek%20Community.docx,**,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,http://sustain.indiana.edu/programs/greek-community-initative/index.php,--

Miami University,2016-03-02,2016-03-02 14:18:00,kliney@miamioh.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Interpretive Signage Mounting Method,"Sometimes advancing sustainability requires an innovative solution to an unusual circumstance.  Taking great pride in the appearance of the campus landscape, Miami University is sensitive to the numbers, locations and styles of outdoor signage.  Indeed, campus planners had just commissioned an effort to update outdoor signage standards as a major portion of Western Campus came back online, sporting many new green features.   
Without signage standards, the Sustainability office faced a tough challenge -- finding a signage mounting method that would allow us to deploy interpretive signs that looked permanent, but could easily be removed or relocated without damage or disruption to the landscape.  Miami provided a concept design of a sign mount that clamped around our new LED lampposts.  Using the existing light from the lamp itself, the signs can be read at night as well as day.  Fabricated by Pannier, the new mounts provided a polished and permanent look for our interpretive signs, while allowing them to be easily relocated.  The ability to easily relocate and change the content facilitates student content creation, thereby enhancing the campus as a living laboratory.  
Visitors to campus have asked about the mounting method, and one of Miami’s interior designers commented:
I really appreciate the custom/flexible nature of the signs.  It’s genius to have them work with the light poles!
","The QR code allows us to track the number of times and when they have been used.  To date, the number of unique hits is 71, with the ""hydrology"" sign drawing the most attention.

Research has shown that high-impact educational experiences complement classroom learning, increase student retention and engagement, and maximize the collegiate experience. NC State University has created programming that couples sustainability with high-impact educational practices, resulting in greater integration of sustainability into the cumulative student learning experience.

On a campus where more than 60 percent of incoming students report that the university’s sustainability commitment was a factor in their decision to attend NC State, the University Sustainability Office and its partners seek to provide high-impact educational experiences that integrate sustainability. The goals of this project are to infuse sustainability into student learning beyond the classroom, work in partnership with multiple university departments, academic colleges and community organizations, and advance student exploration of systems-thinking and multiple aspects of sustainability.","NC State sustainability's high-impact activities strategy has resulted in positive student outcomes as well as a number of other benefits for campus sustainability programs. 

The Sustainability Office, which tracks its active sustainability-related partnerships on campus, connected with 162 campus organizations, departments and centers last year, demonstrating how several years worth of high-impact activities are spreading sustainability’s reach within the university. These partnerships create an ever-growing network of campus sustainability champions that have successfully demonstrated multiple aspects of sustainability, from improving energy efficiency to advancing micro-entrepreneurship in an international country. 

Students outcomes include gaining hands-on career experience while also learning about sustainability. For example, all the students in the LEED Laboratory course now have real-world experience in improving sustainability of buildings. Among the NC State Stewards (student sustainability ambassadors), the application process is becoming increasingly competitive as more and more students apply to be part of this high-impact student group. In the 2014-2015 academic year, the NC State Stewards impacted campus by hosting 24 sustainability-related educational sessions, saving $9,000 in one month from facilitating residence hall energy competitions, recycling nearly 4,500 plastics bags through a new plastic bag recycling program and presenting a 2-year plastic bag phase-out plan to university leadership.They also hosted a series Do-It-Yourself (DIY) workshops that reuse common materials to create new items, created a GIS-mapped campus plant walks, and were awarded a nearly $30,000 grant to build an outdoor shade structure featuring solar energy.

NC State’s sustainability-focused high-impact activities have also increased sustainability outreach in the past year such as a 17% increase in the number of Earth Month event offerings, a 59% increase in number of campus events at which sustainability information was available, and a 44% increase in the number of event in which Sustainability Office or NC State Stewards were involved in the planning. In addition, 40 students worked with the Sustainability Office (only 4 of these are paid internships) and an additional 211 people volunteered at a sustainability-related event or program. There has also been an increased interest in sustainability-related news. More than 52,000 users visited the university’s sustainability websites, an increase of nearly 30% over last year. Collectively, followers on NC State sustainability social media have topped 6,000 with a 33% increase on Twitter and a 15% increase on Facebook. Also, the weekly sustainability e-newsletter boasts more than 3,300 subscribers, up 15% from last year, and a 37% average open rate, which is far above the average industry open rate.

Last but certainly not least are dozens of testimonials from students who have been impacted by sustainability-related high-impact activities. While their experiences cannot be adequately described in numbers, student transformation is undeniably the most significant outcome of NC State’s sustainability high-impact activities.

Northern Arizona University,2016-02-23,2016-02-23 18:52:14,Ellen.Vaughan@nau.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Solar Hot Air Heaters,"NAU is excited to announce the installation of its first on-campus solar thermal air panel system. This installation supports the University’s long-standing commitment to decreasing fossil fuel use and creating a culture of sustainability. The six-panel system was installed on the Campus Surplus warehouse on the main campus. The wall-mounted system is 24 feet wide by 8 feet high and can generate more than 40,000 BTUs per hour of fossil-free heat energy. As a side benefit, this single installation reduces CO2e by over 3 tons per year.

Rachelle Berry, Office of Sustainability Americorps Member, worked with NAU’s Green Fund to propose and fund the solar thermal air panel system. “I was very impressed with the initial product demonstrations and believed this solar thermal solution deserved a serious evaluation on campus. It’s really a very simple technology and the economics are great.”

NAU already has a 163 kW solar photovoltaic installation; several wind turbines, and multiple installations of solar hot water heaters across campus. “With Flagstaff’s rank as one of the sunniest cities in the US combined with its substantial heat demand, the high efficiencies and economics of solar thermal air heating are particularly well suited to offset fossil fuel on campus,” said Ellen Vaughan, NAU’s Manager of Sustainability. “There’s a lot of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy options like solar and wind that can help reduce our electrical use, but there’s really not many options for reducing our heating or natural gas use.”

Eric Marcus, Director of the Sustainable Economic Development Initiative (SEDI) of Flagstaff, introduced SolarThermiX, LLC, the manufacturer of the new solar air heaters, to key NAU sustainability personnel. “As an Arizona company, it is rewarding to be working within our own state to promote cost-effective renewable energy technologies and we appreciate the NAU opportunity facilitated through SEDI,” said Michael Corridan, Co-Founder of Phoenix-based SolarThermiX.  “We initially thought that Colorado and New Mexico opportunities would come easier, but the encouragement we have received from SEDI and NAU has opened our eyes to the potential in our own back yard. I hope this pilot installation accelerates consideration by the Governor’s Office of Renewable Energy and the US Department of Energy to further assist adoption of this renewable energy technology, particularly for academic institutions and Native American housing in Northern Arizona.” added Corridan.

“It’s great to participate in developing and completing a project like this on campus” added Rachelle, “I would encourage all members of the NAU community to personally experience the performance of this system at Property Surplus. I also need to thank the Green Fund for funding this project and recommend anyone with a sustainable project idea to attend one of their workshops.”","The system generates more than 40,000 BTUs per hour of fossil-free heat energy.

Pennsylvania State University,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 11:48:56,mme2@psu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Unit-level Sustainability Strategic Planning,"As part of a plan to fully integrate sustainability throughout Penn State's teaching, research and outreach missions, and its campus operations, the Sustainability Institute (SI) has taken an innovative approach that might serve as a model for other institutions. This approach was developed as the University entered a new strategic planning cycle, which seemed to be an ideal time to encourage strategic planning units (e.g., colleges and support units) to embed sustainability into their own strategic plans.
First, the SI worked with upper-level administration to encourage the inclusion of sustainability goals in the unit-level planning guidelines issued by the Provost.
Second, the SI produced a series of resources to guide units in their planning, including the ""Sustainability Planning Guidebook for Teams"" (available online), the online ""Opportunity Finder"" survey, and the ""Sustainability Strategy Framework and SMART Strategy Builder"". One of the key messages in the guidance is for each unit to consider its core mission and focus on its unique contribution to Penn State's sustainability vision and mission. This encourages units to move beyond standard sustainability goals (e.g., increase recycling) and to think creatively about how they might best make a contribution. Sustainability Institute staff worked closely with some units to facilitate this process.
As an example: Penn State Public Media, WPSU, served as one of the early pilots for this approach. Their initial sustainability planning focused on stereotypical actions, such as encouraging recycling, composting, etc. However, a review of their draft plan revealed that many of the actions proposed were already being addressed at the institutional level. The WPSU planners then began to think more broadly about their unit's mission and unique capabilities, and came up with the proposed goal of creating media and learning objects to help people understand sustainability. A recent production ""Water Blues"" is an example of their contribution.
This approach to strategic planning, we feel, is likely to have a larger impact than a top-level sustainability strategic plan alone.

CENHS is likewise a first-of-its-kind: the only research center in the world specifically designed to sponsor research on the energy/environment nexus across the arts, humanities and social sciences. 
Currently, the majority of energy and sustainability research centers across the world focus on the sciences, engineering and policy analysis; however, Rice’s basis for starting the CENHS was its belief that the riddles of the world’s energy transition and anthropogenic climate change are also profoundly social and cultural.  The CENHS believes that we need to better understand habits, beliefs, knowledge, ethics, values, practices and institutions if we are to hope for change.  From past experience, we know that there can be no technological solutions to climate change without successful programs of implementation, and implementation is always a social, cultural and political process.  Thus, the CENHS was developed to find ways to bring the expertise of the humanities and social sciences more directly to bear on scientific research, technological planning and policy discussions.  
CENHS currently has four active research clusters — Arts & Media, Catastrophe & Aesthetics, Ethics & Philosophy, and Social Analytics – each of which is tasked with developing a different area of energy and environmental research in the human sciences. Furthermore, the CENHS organizes activities to bring together faculty and students interested in energy and environmental research, offering opportunities for junior and senior research fellowships, and sponsoring events to connect with the public. At the same time working together with universities in Canada, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, CENHS is helping to build the first international research network in energy and environmental human sciences.","CENHS hosts an annual “Cultures of Energy” Symposium where leading local, national and international scholars working at the intersection of energy, the environment and the humanities gather to collaborate with one another, share their research and discuss emerging energy topics.  In May of 2014, CENHS hosted its Third (and largest) Annual Spring Symposium.

The Battle for the Boot has been a friendly competition; SLU has participating in for the past three years, all of which SLU has won.  This year, we are taking it to the next level, the St. Louis Higher Education Sustainability Consortium is coordinating the battle amongst a total five higher education institutions across the St. Louis region. 

All shoes collected support Solea Water; a locally owned nonprofit institution.

Santa Clara University,2016-02-26,2016-02-26 20:44:59,lkalkbrenner@scu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,SCU's Integrated Response to the California Drought,"After California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in regards to the ongoing drought crisis, Santa Clara University took an integrated approach to addressing the issue. In our efforts to reach an overall 25% reduction in potable water use, SCU has initiated public media campaigns, began the transition to less lawns and more drought-tolerant plants, and bridged the discourse gap between academics and operations.

1) The Center for Sustainability and Associated Student Government have teamed up for 60 Seconds Less, a creative campaign that encourages campus affiliates to cut 60 seconds or more off their time in the shower. Using community-based marketing and incentives, student government designed a pledge, educated students on effective ways to manage their water usage, and distributed shower timers and token bracelets to prompt shorter shower reminders. The campaign has now spread beyond the campus community to the greater public via Bay Area news agencies. 

2) An example within academics is in the Communications Department where Dr. Chad Raphael has been teaching his students how to enter the dialogue surrounding the drought in a proactive way. In their Dialogue and Deliberation course, class members organized three forums to discuss how students and the university can conserve water in the current drought, using three broad approaches to water conservation – voluntary measures, creating incentives to conserve, and mandatory restrictions. Course recommendations included further marketing through social media, starting a “Water Challenge” competition between residence halls, and encouraging off-campus residents to talk with their landlords about the benefits of xeriscaping. 

3) To show solidarity with residents, public institutions, and businesses required to abide by Governor Brown’s reduction mandate, University Operations evaluated their buildings and grounds operations. After establishing a pilot program of California field sedge in different areas on campus grounds, a third party contractor was hired to begin transitioning unused lawn to native, drought-tolerant plants that matches the campus aesthetic. SCU is working on increasing the use of recycled water (which is already the majority of campus grounds) and all decorative fountains have been turned off or will be converted to operate with recycled water. 

The Facilities department is increasing efforts to more efficiently monitor water fixtures in buildings as well as implementing technology to detect and respond to leaks. Student groups are initiating water fixture audits to determine which units should be replaced to decrease flow rates. Additionally, recycled water is also used for toilet flushing in several buildings and the expansion of recycled water use is being explored for other parts of campus operations. Recently, Facilities decided it will also no longer wash the exterior of buildings' windows. 
The campus garden is replacing all annual non-vegetable plants and flowers with California natives and drought-tolerant species. The garden is also on a drip irrigation system, thus reducing the risk of over-watering vegetables and trees.

Overall, the SCU drought response has worked to alter the mindset of campus affiliates as well as make necessary operational changes. This method contributes most effectively to realizing the state's 25% reduction goals and creating long-term sustainable solutions. ","The 60 Seconds Less campaign has had direct, personal outreach to over 500 students, and hundreds more through social media posts. 
Dr. Raphael's student projects included 75 participants. 

Through the native grasses pilot program, we have planted approximately 1000 square feet of carex praegracilis, a California native field sedge. 
The first lawn to be transitioned to native, drought-tolerant shrubs is approximately 3000 square feet.

Residence hall bathrooms have several kinds of water-efficient fixtures, including low-flow shower heads (1.5 gallons per minute), sink aerators (2.2 gpm), and low-flow toilets (1.6 gpm). 
Laundry facilities include only front-loading washing machines, which uses 35-50% less water than top-loading models.

Smith College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 08:30:44,dweisbor@smith.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Paradise Pond Invasive Species Removal and Mapping,"For the past five years, students working as summer interns for the Botanic Garden of Smith College have mapped and documented the invasive species found around Paradise Pond on Smith’s campus.  From 2010 to 2012, students mapped populations of plants, and in 2013 and 2014 individual plants were mapped. After students have mapped the plants they then remove them, through hand-pulling and other identified methods, in conjunction with Botanic Garden staff.  The five years of invasive species data that students have collected gives landscape managers at Smith College comprehensive information about the invasive species present here, how they respond to removal, and what their reoccurrence is the following year.  

The most recent mapping was conducted by intern Jessie Blum (‘15) using a GPs unit in the field to map individual plants.  Blum’s results show that many of the species removed the previous year returned due to root mass and large seed banks still in the ground.  The first map that Blum created shows the most common invasive species found in each grid cell. To do this, she used a fishnet grid in ArcGIS and went through each grid to find the species that had the most representation in each grid cell. This method allows the spread of the invasive species to be shown clearly while also showing the dominant species. Between this map and the individual plant counts, it is clear that invasive species are able to be managed, but are coming back with the same vigor each year. 

Particular focus was put on the “Big 9” invasive species: autumn olive, oriental bittersweet, glossy buckthorn, Japanese barberry, Japanese knotweed, multiflora rose, Norway maple, tartarian honeysuckle, and winged euonymus.  Blum also created a sequence of maps showing the spread of each of the “Big 9” invasive species.  These maps are helpful in looking at the density and spread of each species by themselves.  The most prevalent species were Japanese knotweed, oriental bittersweet, and multiflora rose.  

In 2014 all of the invasive plants surveyed were removed, except for mature Buckthorn and Norway Maples that will be dealt with in the summer of 2015.  For the species that need chemical applications, such as Japanese knotweed and Norway maples, Jay Girard and John Berryhill, licensed herbicide technicians from the Botanic Garden, applied the herbicide to freshly cut individual plant stems.

The fifth year of removal events proved again, without question, that invasive plants can be controlled successfully with very little collateral damage to native plants, using the methods identified by the Botanic Garden. 

Student summer workers were organized and supervised by Gaby Immerman, Laboratory Instructor, Biological Sciences. Oversight and supervision was also provided by Jay Girard, Landscape Manager, Botanic Garden, and John Berryhill, Chief Arborist, Botanic Garden. Jay and John are both licensed herbicide technicians and both participated in the plant removal activities. 
","Students working in the Botanic Garden summer internship program have single-handedly controlled the spread of invasive plants on Smith College’s campus.  This is not only important for Smith College, but for the communities downstream of Smith College along the Mill River, which flows into and out of Paradise Pond.  

Because of the work of students and the support of Botanic Garden staff, the number of invasive plants around Paradise Pond has stayed largely the same for the past five years, and is now mapped in a way that is extremely useful for long range planning and landscape management.  Minimizing the spread of invasive plants, especially the “Big 9” plants, is extremely difficult.  Time spent removing the plants (cutting & treating) in 2014 took about 86 hours.  Additionally, the fifth year of removal work proved that the invasive plants can be controlled successfully with very little collateral damage to the native plants around them.   

Since beginning this work five years ago, Botanic Garden staff have been interested in shifting from removal to restoration of the target areas of riverbank, and that shift is now taking place.  This year the New England Wildflower Society has been contracted to create an Invasive Species Management Plan for the College.  Such a plan will bring eradication efforts in line with best practices and establish an annual calendar of activities.  

The next step will be to establish native species in gaps created by invasive removal, so as to move forward toward a time when the number of invasive seedlings will be reduced.

Stanford University,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 01:13:44,mbhafer@stanford.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Design for Extreme Affordability,"Design for Extreme Affordability is a two-quarter course offered at Stanford’s d.school jointly by the Graduate School of Business and the School of Mechanical Engineering. This multidisciplinary project-based experience creates an enabling environment in which students learn to design products and services that will change the lives of the world’s poorest citizens. Students work directly with course partner organizations on real world problems, the culmination of which is actual implementation of solutions and real change.

Over the past ten years, student teams have worked with 26 partner organizations in 18 countries on solutions in the areas of agriculture, architecture, energy, food processing, irrigation, lighting, medical devices, nutrition, sanitation, stove technology and water catchment and purification. Partners are often the implementers of these innovations, but sometimes student teams form their own organization to carry an idea forward.

The course has two main goals: that every student has a great educational experience and that every partner gets a great outcome. Furthermore, sustainability from a business standpoint is at the core of Extreme's philosophy regarding impact. The course emphasizes the importance of enterprise and entrepreneurship because instructors believe they are the most important factors in a project's long-term success and sustainability.","There are too many positive measurable outcomes to describe all at length in this submission. A few examples are provided below, but the complete list of all projects, outcomes, and current status can be found online (http://extreme.stanford.edu/projects/list).

(1) Clubfoot is a congenital birth defect that results in the internal rotation of one or both feet. With a new case occurring in every 750 births and over one million untreated cases worldwide, clubfoot is one of the leading causes of disability in the developing world. Left untreated, clubfoot results in physical deformity and social stigma. The miraclefeet brace is a low-cost (<$20) foot abduction brace designed to treat clubfoot using the non-surgical Ponseti method. With proper compliance, treatment success rates of 95% can be achieved.

(2) A third of the world’s population suffers from water scarcity. Without access to affordable water efficient irrigation, small-plot farmers are unable to grow crops during much of the year to support their families. International Development Enterprises Ethiopia (IDE-Ethiopia) challenged the students to make drip irrigation appropriate and accessible and to small-plot farmers. Driptech irrigation systems offer the benefits of traditional commercial drip irrigation with additional features optimized for one acre plots. For instance, these irrigation systems are designed for very low water pressures, with gravity feed from buckets and tanks and are easy to install, maintain, and expand. They cost two to five time less than traditional drip irrigation, and boast visibly higher uniformity of water application than any other low-cost irrigation product.

(3) Pneumonia is the number one killer of children under the age of 5 worldwide, yet receives only a fraction of the attention given to HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Named ""The Forgotten Killer of Children"" by the World Health Organization, severe pneumonia remains difficult to treat in low-resource settings due to the lack of intensive care technologies. Resourceful doctors in the developing world have developed an effective therapy known as Bubble CPAP to deliver respiratory support to children with severe pneumonia. Existing methods, however, are hampered by a reliance on oxygen tanks, which are expensive, dangerous, and notoriously difficult to transport. One group in the Design For Extreme Affordability course realized that a critical therapeutic aspect of CPAP is the air pressure generated by the device, rather than simply the oxygen itself. They created a product called Inspire, which utilizes pumps to pressurize the ambient air, which is then delivered to the patients to keep their lungs open. The device is capable of running off a car battery for many hours at a time and does not require oxygen tanks to deliver therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure. Inspire was selected as a Social E Lab awardee in Summer 2011. Having begun the project in January 2011, the group returned to Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam to user-test the interface of the device in its practice setting later on. This project has been supported, in part, by a global health innovation grant from the NIH, known as C-IDEA. The project is currently a member of the XSEED laboratories and is working towards obtaining CE mark approval of the device.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/293/6/585/3285/Design%20for%20Extreme%20Affordability%20Letter%20of%20Affirmation_1.pdf,**,True,--,True,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,http://extreme.stanford.edu/,--
State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 01:51:04,malichte@esf.edu,2.0,Pursuing,ESF Establishes New Protocol to Honor Indigenous People,"ESF President Quentin Wheeler--joined by leaders of the ESF Center for Native Peoples and the Environment; Clanmothers, other leaders, and other members of the Onondaga Nation; and ESF students--Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2015, announced the College's recognition of its physical location on the original territory of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and of his intention to formally share that acknowledgement with visitors to the campus. This is the first known proclamation of its type for a public institution of higher learning. President Wheeler highlighted three points:

- ESF is located within the original territory of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, Confederacy;
- The College is within the Land Rights Action of the Onondaga Nation; and
- The Onondaga Nation maintains its own distinct government, language and customs based on a smaller portion of its original land base located south of Syracuse, New York.

The event--""Where We Stand""--was part of ESF's observance of Native American Heritage Month. The ceremony was followed by a workshop, ""Envisioning Indigenous Alliances,"" to discuss environmental alliances between ESF and Indigenous Peoples.

At the event, President Wheeler said: ""I am pleased to announce that, from this day forward, we will share similar statements of these facts with thousands of students and guests who visit our campus each year. This represents our commitment to intellectual inclusion and cultural pluralism and it honors the significant contributions of the Onondaga Nation to environmental leadership. These statements reinforce our responsibility to think about where we stand in the context of history, geography and environmental understanding so that we are ever-cognizant of the implications of our work for the real world. As individual persons, our time here is brief, but the land is permanent and our decisions and actions toward the land have consequences for many generations to come. We stand on the side of responsible stewardship of the land.""

The college's location on the original territory of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy will be memorialized in a permanent stone monument to be placed on the ESF campus in the near future.The long-standing protocol of symbolizing the commitment was honored by presenting a string of wampum to Tadodaho Sid Hill (Chief) of the Onondaga Nation.

Also at the event, Dr. Robin Kimmerer, Director of the ESF Center for Native Peoples and the Environment, explained that Central New York is the home of ""two great intellectual traditions for understanding and caring for the Earth""--the Traditional Ecological Knowledge of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and the Scientific Ecological Knowledge of ESF. ""SUNY-ESF has stood on this ground for more than 100 years, a long and venerable history of education for the environment,"" she said. ""However, our tenure here is but an eye blink of time in the history of these lands, which have been and continue to be the ancestral homelands of the Onondaga people since time immemorial.""

Undergraduate Student Association (USA) President Margaret Foley said the announcement by Wheeler was well timed in view of recent action by the USA, which recently passed a resolution urging ESF, Syracuse University and New York State to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day as a holiday. ""As students we often hear about the Onondaga Nation connection from our professors or in our classrooms,"" Foley said. ""Now in addition to being taught about that connection in the classroom we will be reminded of our connection to the Haudenosaunee every time we hear our president speak.""

Tadodaho Hill said climate change is a major issue facing future generations: ""The young people are the ones who are going to have to face these climate issues. It's what our generations have not taken care of. There's so much to learn, so much to teach. It's good to see so many young people here.""

Joe Heath, general counsel for the Onondaga Nation, said after the event: ""Ten years ago, the Chiefs and Clanmothers directed us to include the first paragraph in the Land Rights action that called for healing. Healing of the environmental destruction and devastation and disrespect for their lands and waters, and the healing among the settlers who have come to live on their land. And, these steps by ESF today are a clear reflection of how well that message has been received in the Central New York community. So let us use one of the principles of the Great Law to move together and use our good minds to find solutions to the problems that are causing all of us difficulty - the problems of climate change, problems of a heavily polluted lake, the problems of the mudboils - and move together from this day to make a world better for the generations yet to come.""","ESF's Center for Native Peoples and the Environment is a very unique organization within academia. It recognizes that the region hosting ESF is the home of two great intellectual traditions regarding stewardship of the earth: traditional ecological knowledge of indigenous people and scientific ecological knowledge. The mission of the Center is to create programs that draw on the wisdom of both indigenous and scientific knowledge in support of our shared goals of environmental sustainability.

In addition to serving as a bridge between traditional ecological knowledge and western scientific approaches, the Center incorporates indigenous perspectives and knowledge for the benefit of native students and work to educate mainstream students in a cross-cultural context.

The Center includes a significant outreach element focused on increasing educational opportunities for Native American students in environmental sciences, research collaborations, and partnerships with Native American communities to address local environmental problems.

Solutions to complex ecological problems require not only scientific expertise, but also understanding of the cultural context in which they occur. Cross-cultural competence thus becomes an important component of functioning effectively in the global scientific community. This is particularly true in the environmental disciplines, where science and culture intersect. All over the world, conservation biologists and policy makers are realizing the importance of incorporating local and indigenous knowledge into conservation efforts. However, such efforts cannot go forward without full and equitable participation by indigenous people. Native Americans are the most under-represented group in the American scientific community, and are ""barely a presence in science"" according to a report of the National Science Foundation. A 1991 study found a ""consistent and nearly complete absence of American Indian faculty members in science and engineering."" If the valuable contributions of indigenous thinking are to be incorporated into the realm of environmental problem solving, we must envision ways to increase the participation of native people in the environmental dialogue.

The Center's programs can provide a framework for increased participation of traditionally underrepresented Native American students in the scientific community. The Center is dedicated to nurturing the success of Native American students through its efforts in outreach at the pre-college level, in student recruitment, retention, and support.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/220/6/585/3285/CNPE%20STARS%20Letter%20Feb%202016.pdf,**,True,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,True,--,--,Social justice and equity; environmental justice,http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=3955,--

Sterling College,2016-01-28,2016-01-28 10:04:28,cfeuerstein@sterlingcollege.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Climate resilience run across Iceland,"Pavel Cenkl, faculty member in Environmental Humanities at Sterling College, had a unique idea for raising awareness about climate change: run across Iceland.

In June, Pavel Cenkl, 43, of Craftsbury, Vermont, set out from Iceland’s Atlantic coast and ended up at the Artic Ocean, three days and 171 miles later. The semi-supported solo run, named Kjölur Run, took him past the glaciers, thermal springs and waterfalls of Iceland’s Kjölur Plateau.

Cenkl is something of a multi-sport academic: in addition to typical-sounding courses like Literature of the Northeast, he teaches courses in Adventure Literature, Rock and Ice Climbing and Trail Running.

“My academic work has focused on the relationship between people and the natural world,” says Cenkl, who, in addition to serving on Sterling's Environmental Humanities faculty, is Director of Athletics and coaches the school’s trail-and-mountain-running team, the first of its kind on the U.S. collegiate scene. “I see significant interweaving between helping students understand and enjoy physical challenge outside and studying the way humans interact with nature.”

Iceland holds special significance for Cenkl—he first visited the country as a 5-year-old, and returned in 2007 to teach a field class—which was one reason that he chose to locate his run there. But Iceland also has broader symbolic weight when it comes to the climate.

“[Iceland] is at an ecological crossroads,” he explains. “The Arctic is where the impact of climate change has already been felt most keenly, and Iceland itself has seen significant glacial recession.”

With Kjölur Run, Cenkl hopes to encourage athletes and adventurers to think about the role they can play in confronting climate change.

“As outdoor athletes, we are unique in the ways that we depend on a consistent and active relationship with our environment,” Cenkl says. “We’re out in it all the time and often witness subtle changes in seasonality, temperature or snowpack more keenly and more immediately.”","The run brought a lot of public attention to the issue of athletes and climate change. Dr. Cenkl was profiled in Vermont Sports, Trail Runner Magazine, and National Geographic, to name just three publications. Dr. Cenkl was also named one of 2015's Vermont Athletes of the Year for this run. Response was so positive that he is considering another run this summer; it might not be across Iceland but it might be another area that highlights the need for climate resilience.

The Ohio State University,2016-01-26,2016-01-26 15:47:02,dial.15@osu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,University Bike Share System Project,"Ohio State launched a full-scale bike share program in September 2015 that sought to provide a safe and sustainable alternative transportation option for both the campus population and surrounding community.  The program currently offers 115 bicycles distributed across 15 campus locations and boasts one of the more diverse inventories of bicycle options available at any collegiate bike share program in the country to date.  In addition to the 100 cruiser-style bikes in the inventory the program innovatively offers more than 15 alternatively-styled bikes such as side-by-side tandems, hand-cycles, heavy duty and three-wheeled cargo style models designed to be both ADA-friendly and accessible to the largest contingent of members possible.

Apart from incorporating an innovative menu of bicycle options the university worked extensively with a diverse stakeholder group of campus planners, project managers, faculty members, student organizations, and representatives of Student Government to develop a high-quality program that not only demonstrates the university’s commitment to environmental consciousness and sustainability, but one that will also integrate well with other modes of transportation, reduce roadway congestion and harmful vehicle emissions, while encouraging healthy lifestyle choices.  

In an urban campus environment bicycles often provide a faster, cheaper, and more economical way to get around than driving a single occupancy vehicle and the bike share program will help to support the university’s ‘Park Once’ philosophy of reducing inter-campus vehicle trips thereby improving the efficiency of the campus transportation system. Affordability is one of the most important issues driving program success, so the university leveraged its purchasing power so as to include a sizable membership discount for university students.  Bolstered by high levels of excitement and early program success of more than 500 active members and utilization above the industry benchmark of 1 ride per bike per day, the university has developed program expansion plans which seek to add an additional 100 bikes to the fleet over the next couple of years.

University at Buffalo,2016-01-19,2016-01-19 10:15:57,jlk47@buffalo.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Communities of Excellence,"UB is investing $25 million in an initiative that will harness the strengths of faculty from disciplines across the university to confront grand challenges facing humankind.
The university has established  three new Communities of Excellence — an innovative and integrated approach to addressing critical societal challenges through impactful interdisciplinary research, education and engagement. Through Communities of Excellence, teams of faculty will work together to find solutions, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding. Faculty leaders within communities plan to create new educational opportunities that cut across multiple academic disciplines in order to address the focus area of each community.
The three Communities of Excellence, chosen from nearly 100 initial concept proposals submitted by faculty teams, are:

Global Health Equity. This community will work to address the challenge of global health inequity by bringing together faculty and students from the health sciences and disciplines that are focused on the social, economic, political and environmental conditions that lead to inequities. This community will tackle problems ranging from a lack of access to sanitation for women and girls in poor countries to high rates of non-communicable diseases due to complex sets of factors, including tobacco use and the environment.

Sustainable Manufacturing and Advanced Robotic Technologies (SMART). This community will build upon UB’s reputation as a leader in advanced manufacturing and design by developing the next generation of manufacturing technologies, processes and education that enable sustainable, cost-effective production of high-quality, customizable products. SMART will leverage university and regional strength in manufacturing and partner with regional companies to educate future manufacturing leaders and shape national policy.

The Genome, the Environment and the Microbiome (GEM). This community will work to advance understanding of areas that will enable development of personalized medicine and empower individuals to have greater control over and understanding of their health, the human genome and the human microbiome — the trillions of microorganisms living in and on the human body. Through collaboration among the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, GEM will enhance UB’s reputation in genomics to make UB a national model for promoting and increasing genomic literacy.

The university is investing $25 million over the next five years in these Communities of Excellence and RENEW (Research and Education in eNergy, Environment and Water), which was launched last year and was UB’s model for the Communities of Excellence. 

RENEW’s research thrusts will address a variety of prominent issues, such as energy diversification, freshwater protection and restoration; ecosystem science, engineering and policy; societal adaptation to changing environments and the green economy; public health; and environmental management and governance. 

More than 300 faculty members from across the university are active participants in the Communities of Excellence; the initiative is expected to involve faculty from all UB schools.
",The most recent announcement for this initiative was made in May 2015. The measurable outcome is the establishment and funding of the communities of excellence demonstrating the University at Buffalo's commitment to sustainability in all aspects of its endeavor.

Started in 2011, the five-year, $88-million project will replace UBC’s aging steam infrastructure with a more efficient hot water district energy system. 

The project is an integral component of UBC’s Climate Action Plan and will enable us to achieve our ambitious target of reducing campus-wide GHG emissions of 33 per cent by 2015, compared to 2007 levels. The ADES will also provide an enabling platform to achieve our long-term target of eliminating the use of fossil fuels on campus by 2050 and advance clean energy research development and demonstration opportunities.

UBC’s steam to hot water conversion project demonstrates an innovative approach to infrastructure management and leveraging cyclical maintenance investment to achieve multiple sustainability objectives. The project will eliminate $190 million in deferred maintenance, reduce operating costs, improve operational safety and system resiliency on campus, and dramatically reduce energy and water consumption.  

The new district energy system will require less energy to heat the campus, will significantly reduce distribution losses, and will allow for increased compatibility with clean energy supply technologies, enabling a more flexible platform to integrate current and future renewable and alternative energy sources into the UBC grid. The new system will also provide a platform for collaboration between researchers, students, staff and industry partners to explore and develop clean energy technologies and campus as a living laboratory demonstration projects. 

","Once complete in Fall 2015, the ADES will heat over 130 buildings, including over 8.6 million square feet (800,000 square meters) of floor space for hot air and domestic hot water. This project represents one of the largest hot water conversions in North America with 11 km of pre-insulated hot water distribution piping, over 100 energy transfer stations in building mechanical rooms, and a new state-of-the-art 60 -megawatt, natural gas-powered Campus Energy Centre Hot Water Plant.

The ADES will reduce UBC’s thermal energy use by 24 by per cent and GHG emissions by over 22 per cent, the equivalent of reducing 11,000 tonnes of GHG emissions, or taking 2,000 cars off the road. The project will also reduce annual campus water consumption by 136 million gallons (136,000 cubic metres) when completed, equivalent to saving 54 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water each year. The project will result in annualized cost savings and cost avoidance of over $5.5 million per year.

"University of California, Berkeley",2016-03-23,2016-03-23 14:26:50,lmcneilly@berkeley.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Campus Drought Response,"In response to California's severe drought, Governor Jerry Brown officially declared a statewide drought emergency, and created mandatory reductions by urban water providers of 25 percent. 

The campus response to the drought has been proactive, from fixing leaks to changing behaviors to finding long-term reduction solutions across all areas of consumption. In total the campus currently uses 636 million gallons of water, which is 17% less than in 2008 – meaning the campus goal has been met.  Use is estimated to be down 9% since the drought declaration.
 
The installation of additional water meters will improve water consumption monitoring at UC Berkeley.  The campus recently installed and upgraded meters in over twenty buildings, bringing the total number of metered buildings to 70. These digital meters allow Facilities Services to monitor usage online and respond to leaks more quickly. In addition to addressing leaks, Facilities Services also works to investigate water use in some of the largest-consuming campus buildings. Starting with Life Sciences Addition, the team has been monitoring water meters, working with building managers to implement an Aquatics Lab Policy Change, improving the efficiency of the cooling tower, and investigating the sump and vacuum pumps. The results are highly positive: LSA’s water consumption has decreased by 32% from fiscal year 13-14 to fiscal year 14-15. 

While landscaping accounts for less than 10% of campus water usage, it remains a very visible and important component. Facilities Services and others have worked to upgrade and automate the irrigation system over the last few years. Projects have included installing weather station-based controllers, drip and low precipitation sprinkler heads, and water flow meters on all systems.  Upcoming work includes the installation of new flow switches to ensure repairs happen more quickly in the event of a valve or sprinkler head break.
 
 In addition to increasing the efficiency of the irrigation system, there have been many efforts to reduce the amount of irrigated lawn on campus. The campus has converted 3.5 acres of turf in the past year to use less water. This lawn conversion program was originally funded through a TGIF Grant, but has now been expanded to convert unused lawns to native and drought tolerant species.

"University of California, Davis",2016-03-28,2016-03-28 16:31:52,cmkirk@ucdavis.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Wild Campus,"Wild Campus is a student-run organization which works to conserve wildlife at the UC Davis campus. Students work with faculty, staff, local environmental organizations, and volunteers to improve campus habitats. Wild campus is a unique program which brings students out of the classroom and into the wild, where they can engage in real-world conservation experiences. 

Wild Campus recently partnered with the Putah Creek Riparian Reserve to extend its conservation efforts to a 12-acre portion of the reserve. The Reserve is a 640 acre stream, riparian and grassland ecosystem on the UC Davis campus managed for teaching, research, and wildlife and habitat protection. The 12-acre portion of the reserve is called the ""Wild Reserve,"" and students will lead a wide range of projects including invasive species eradication and biomonitoring. Additionally, the students plan to tell the story of Davis’ wildlife through interpretive signage.

Wild Campus has three main programs - Wild Ambassadors, Wild Naturalists, and Wild Forces. 
Wild Ambassadors: The Wild Ambassadors are composed of two teams, each with a different focus (Education/Outreach Team and Marketing/Communications Team). These teams are the public face of Wild Campus, and serve the role of ambassador to Davis’ local wildlife. They put on two events each year, our contribution to the Picnic Day wildlife exhibit, Wild Picnic Day, and the annual celebration of local wildlife, Wild Family Day, as well as reach out to the public online, in print, and through external media exposure. 

Wild Naturalists: 
The Wild Naturalists are composed of six teams, each with a different taxonomic focus (Amphibian/Reptile Team, Bird Team, Fish Team, Insect Team, Mammal Team, and Plant Team). The Wild Naturalists will primarily be serving two roles: carrying out one or more Active Conservation Projects (predetermined according to the team’s multi-year plan) a year, most of which will be based within the Wild Reserve as well the Control Site (both located within the UC Davis Putah Creek Riparian Reserve just southwest of central campus), and performing various forms of monitoring within the Wild Reserve to assess the long-term impact that Wild Campus is having on the wildlife communities there.

Wild Forces:
Wild Forces is a unified community of students and citizens who use their collective power to make meaningful impacts in the quality of wildlife habitat in their local community. Anyone can join the Wild Forces; the only requirement is a passion for helping wildlife! There are absolutely no time requirements. Members are free to participate in all, some, or no events as they so choose. Members of the Wild Forces will be alerted of special habitat restoration/enhancement events periodically throughout the year. The special projects will mostly consist of habitat restoration and/or enhancement of various sorts, but any project that benefits local wildlife can qualify.

Wild Campus also does outreach to schools in the Davis community. In the Adopt-a-Wild-Flat program, fourth-grade classes grow native plant plugs for habitat restoration events with the facilitation of Wild Campus members. In the Wild Woodshop program, junior high woodshop students from both Holmes and Emerson Junior High Schools in Davis generously donate their skilled labor to cut and construct Wild Homes for Wild Campus’ various programs.",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/551/6/585/3285/stars_2-0_ucdavis_innovation-4_wild_campus.pdf,**,--,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,http://wildcampus.ucdavis.edu/,--

UC’s Office of the President has provided funding for fellowships in support of these goals and has turned to staff at UCI to help CNI and GFI fellows solidify their skills as the nation’s next generation of sustainability leaders.

To date, UCI staff have designed and facilitated three Sustainability Leadership Retreats to help CNI and GFI fellows gain or increase their skills in transformational leadership, communications about critical climate and food issues, and select organizing skills; to provide a community-building forum for participants to reflect more deeply and critically about the global context in which their fellowship projects take place; to provide a platform for participants to engage in dialogue and peer learning to enhance their current carbon neutrality and food sustainability practices and projects; and to formulate collective reflection and input for broader sharing and impact.

In November 2013, UC President Janet Napolitano announced the CNI, which commits UC to emitting net zero greenhouse gases from its buildings and vehicle fleet by 2025, something no other major university system has done. See: http://www.ucop.edu/initiatives/carbon-neutrality-initiative.html

The GFI, launched in July 2014, addresses one of the critical issues of our time: how to sustainably and nutritiously feed a world population expected to reach 8 billion by 2025. The initiative aligns the university’s research, outreach and operations in a sustained effort to develop, demonstrate and export solutions – throughout California, the United States and the world – for food security, health, and sustainability. See:  http://www.ucop.edu/global-food-initiative/","UCI now leads UC systemwide sustainability leadership trainings for climate and food student fellows from all 10 campuses. The retreats are led by UCI’s Sustainability Initiative and Global Sustainability Resource Center in conjunction with community partners SERES, a Central American organization whose mission is to empower young leaders to build sustainable, healthy and thriving communities through education and transformative leadership; and Soul Cocina, which is pioneering FoodScapes, incorporating culture, tradition, seed-to-plate systems thinking, and sustainability.

The first 2.5 day sustainability leadership retreat involved the participation of 15 fellows representing six UC campuses. The retreat was held July 18-20, 2015, at The Red Victorian in San Francisco, California. The second retreat was held January 8-10, 2016, at Camp Arroyo in Livermore, California, with 14 fellows representing seven campuses.  The third retreat was held January 15-17, 2016, at the Steele/Burnand Anza-Borrego Desert Research Center in Borrego Springs, California, with 20 students representing six campuses. UC has dedicated funding to enable UCI to lead an additional two retreats next year to serve the incoming fellow class.

The programming for these retreats is designed to:

-- Develop sustainability, food, organizing, and climate leadership skills relevant to their projects and engagement post-fellowship
-- Deepen understanding and improve capacity to articulate the CNI and GFI objectives and the global context in which their fellowship projects take place
-- Gain clarity about student engagement in the CNI and GFI, and create shared understanding of how to strengthen it in coming years
-- Gain understanding of how to become involved with other student leaders to increase campus and systemwide innovation on climate and food action through existing UC mechanisms
-- Develop a network and strong sense of community with peers across issue
-- Deepen understanding of and generate new thinking about further involvement and commitment to these issues at their home campus, with UC, and beyond after the close of their fellowship year",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/446/6/585/3285/IN-4_UCI_Letter%20of%20Affirmation_1.pdf,**,--,--,True,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,"Carbon Neutrality, Food Security and Sustainability, Environmental Justice, Student Leadership",http://sustainability.uci.edu/uc-system-wide-sustainability-initiatives/,--

This is being done by addressing not just the need for food, but all of the areas that come into play regarding food.  Many students come into the university environment with little knowledge regarding food, particularly nutrition, food preparation, grocery shopping, and budgeting. Without these skills, students may become food insecure, skipping meals and eating poorly for the sake of cost or convenience.  Through education, we help students to eat well and achieve their full potential here at UCSB.  The program addresses issues that play a role in hindering student access to healthy, nutritious and affordable food, through four tracks:
Budgeting and Planning: This track helps students plan and build strong budgets, such as financial planning, creating shopping lists, navigating resources and couponing at cooperatives and grocery stores, finding the best living option to save money, among others.
Kitchen Basics: This track provides students with the skills to learn how to set up your first kitchen in an individual household or while living with multiple people. This includes the basics of cooking, of setting up a kitchen pantry, of properly equipping a kitchen, etc.
Cooking and Nutrition Basics: Students learn, through food demonstrations, how to cook nutritious and balanced meals, how to address food safety, how to read food labels, etc. This track provides individuals with a range of skills ranging from the basic of cooking your first meal to learning how to integrate more nutritious food into your diet. The sample of workshops includes: maximizing leftovers, the soup guy, healthy snacking, etc
Connecting to your food: Our diets have a global impact. This track aims to help students understand the relationship that they have with the world around them through their dietary choices.
The Food, Nutrition and Basic Skills program has brought together fourteen different partners under the leadership of Associate Students Food Bank, so as to leverage the resources of the broader UCSB and adjacent community. University Center Dining has provided organizational abilities, programing and chefs to teach workshops.

"University of California, Santa Cruz",2016-03-23,2016-03-23 11:55:17,ekericks@ucsc.edu,2.0,Pursuing,UCSC Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality by 2025,"In November 2013, UC President Janet Napolitano announced an initiative committing the system to carbon neutrality by 2025.  Around this time, UC Santa Cruz was discussing the need to strategically address the impacts of pending Cap & Trade regulation.  The campus also needed to update its 2008 Strategic Energy Plan and 2011 Climate Action Plan.  To underscore its vision to “ensure that environmental stewardship pervades all that we do,” UCSC decided to charge forward and lead in the investment of a comprehensive Climate & Energy Strategy (CES) to address the President’s bold initiative.

The two primary goals of the CES were to develop a plan for:
Achieving carbon neutrality for Scopes 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, and
Mitigating the impacts of Cap & Trade regulation associated with campus growth.
The vision for achieving these goals was to implement a collaborative process that resulted in the development of an integrated and dynamic plan presenting an array of strategies that includes specific projects, policies and procurements, detailing financial and emissions impacts and risks.  

The objectives for meeting these goals were to:
Ensure the process provided the level of technical detail necessary to ensure a robust analysis and recommendations,
Engage not just with staff during the technical study, but also faculty and students,
Ensure the deliverables were highly visual to easily communicate results and assist in helping decision makers to quickly comprehend impacts, and
Consider the life cycle and total ownership costs of potential strategies for meeting the goals.

The CES included these strategies:
Conduct Level I & II energy audits for 50 of the campus’ most energy intensive buildings, which included over 2.5M SF;
Conduct a campus-wide District Systems Energy Audit to optimize the heating hot water and chilled water loops, and cogeneration plant;
Conduct a Renewable Energy Feasibility study that considers solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, fuel cells and photovoltaic-thermal hybrid technologies;
Develop a techno-economic analysis tool that helps the campus to develop an optimized set of potential strategies that includes the cost and emissions impacts of projects, policies, and procurements;
Engage faculty and students by supporting the development of a Living Lab that enables climate change mitigation research, technology development and experiential learning opportunities.","UCSC engaged a group of pioneering consultant team members to partner in developing the CES.  The Climate & Energy Strategy just recently won the Energy Efficiency & Sustainability Best Practices Award for Sustainability Innovation, a competition among all University of California and California State University campuses.  The process resulted in the development of 350 energy conservation measures in 50 buildings, 20 photovoltaic, solar thermal & fuel cell projects, 12 district system level energy conservation measures, and an additional 700 energy conservation measures extrapolated across all other buildings. 

The Climate and Energy Strategy:
Demonstrates the economic effectiveness of carbon neutrality planning through a comprehensive, technical feasibility study combined with a flexible and robust scenario analysis tool;
Provides a roadmap with specific strategies for achieving neutrality and mitigating regulatory impacts; and
Identifies specific energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to implement by year, considering the impacts on demand and energy use associated with the build-out of the 10-year capital financial plan, and includes specific yearly procurements of biogas, allowances, and offsets through at least 2030.

To develop this roadmap, all energy measures were input into the custom-built techno-economic scenario analysis tool, which generates metrics such as emissions savings, net present value, savings-to-investment ratio, cash flow, cost/MT CO2e through 2055.  The CES Team developed 50+ scenarios, analyzed the results, formulated strategies and recommendations, and developed a dynamic plan for implementation. This plan will be a living document that evolves as market conditions change, the campus adds/revises projects, best practices are refined.

The Tool provides great flexibility to modify scenarios and metrics to explore many strategies for neutrality and regulatory mitigation, evaluating cost and emissions impacts of emphasizing different approaches such as onsite projects, procurement, lowest first-cost, emissions reductions, and cost/ton of MTCO2e reduced. UCSC plans to share this Tool with other campuses, provide a customized training and a user manual.

The energy efficiency and renewable measures include  energy savings, incentives, materials/labor costs, and financing metrics in  absolute-referenced spreadsheets,.  The data is easily imported into the Tool and Higher Education Partnership planning documents.  This enables UCSC to easily update data, revise results and adjust recommendations All measures will be shared widely and can be used as project templates.

UCSC is capturing all details in the process so it can be replicated and plans to share widely all CES resources.  The Team held workshops with 50+ stakeholders at critical milestones to educate them on the CES, present progress to-date, and solicit input.  


The Scenario Analysis Tool developed multiple scenarios that incorporated various combinations of strategies to achieve our goals.  Below is a summary of findings for one of the top carbon neutrality scenarios that also cost-effectively mitigates the impacts of Cap & Trade regulation.  Several strategies are currently being evaluated for consideration as recommendations for the final plan.  In this scenario, UCSC would double its current pace of implementing energy efficiency projects and install about 4MW of solar PV.

Instead, CU has implemented a health-based turf management system using organic fertilizers, hand removal of weeds, and bioassay of soil borings across campus to measure soil microorganism types and populations at varying depths. The key to the health-based system is building and maintaining appropriate levels of soil microorganisms in all turf areas. Using Compost Tea to help inoculate the soils with these microorganisms was seen as a possible technology to accomplish this.
 
With a desire to use Compost Tea for the entire landscape we needed to find a way to apply the product without the use of large boom sprayers as is the normal application method. We worked to create a method of brewing and injecting the Compost Tea extract directly into the irrigation system thus allowing an application to all of the turfgrass and landscape beds in one application without any impact to the campus users. This application method was extremely challenging based on calculation of rates, survival rates of the microorganisms, sprinkler and valve impacts of the product. It took many months of trial and error to determine how to set up the irrigation system to allow proper ""priming"" of the system to make sure that every zone had Compost Tea in the water when the station turned on. 

Based on current technologies and knowledge of other Compost Tea users no other large scale institution has put forth the amount of effort and financial backing to allow for the creation of this innovative application method. Indeed, only a few campuses have moved to a health-based turf management system, and none in Colorado.","The use of Compost Tea has aided in our ability to provide a healthy soil profile which is more conducive to turfgrass health and allows us to maintain a very dense turf canopy which helps prevent the ability for weeds to encroach. We have been doing soil Bio-Assay tests every year since we began Compost Tea injections. We have found that the overall biological life within the soil profile has increased and has allowed us to reduce the use of our organic fertilizer because the soil is more adept at processing organic matter and thus producing plant available nutrients. 

We are also in the early phases of a dedicated research project to help determine scientifically the effectiveness of this approach and this will help us continue to fine tune the Compost Tea program to achieve the best possible results of the new technology.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/13/6/585/3285/CU%20Boulder%20letter.STARS.IN-4.2014.pdf,**,--,True,True,--,--,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,--

University of Connecticut,2016-03-25,2016-03-25 18:15:45,rich.miller@uconn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Campus-wide LED Desk Lamp and Smart Strip Giveaways,"While in past years UConn has given away fluorescent and LED lightbulbs at the bookstore during move-in weekend, this past fall the University partnered with local power company, Eversource, to facilitate an LED desk lamp giveaway to students.  The LED bulbs found within the desk lamps consume about 75% less electricity than the average incandescent bulbs typically sold for use in desk lamps. They also last up to 25 times longer than traditional incandescent lightbulbs, resulting in monetary, as well as energy savings and emissions reductions. The recipients of the desk lamps were primarily freshmen or other underclassmen, consequently this initiative introduced these younger students right off the bat to the ways in which they can incorporate sustainability and energy efficiency in their everyday lives. It also served as an educational outreach opportunity, as the students were informed about several energy efficiency projects undertaken by the University. Since 2010, energy efficiency improvements made on UConn’s campus, including numerous re-lamping projects such as the recent LED replacements at Gampel Pavilion, have reduce the University’s carbon footprint by about 18%.

The partnership with Eversource will also include a University-wide deployment of Smart Power Strips during the summer of 2016. The Smart Power Strip is a surge protector that reduces the phantom load, the phenomenon through which electricity is still delivered to devices that are plugged in, but turned off and not in use.  They do this by only permitting electricity to flow into the appliances when a control device is turned on.  In the case of the University’s deployment, which will targets individual work stations, the computer will act as the control device.  Therefore, the Smart Power Strip will not allow electricity to pass through until the computer plugged into it is turned on.  The Smart Strips will be distributed to about 5,000 offices and work stations in the first wave of deployment as well as in all of the residence halls during this coming summer. If need be, a second deployment will follow in the 2017 academic year in order to ensure that these Smart Strip are used campus-wide. Eversource will be funding 95% of the cost for the deployment and the resulting payback period for the retrofit will be just over one year.
","Over the course of the three-day move-in weekend, 4,500 desk lamps were distributed to incoming University students. That amounts to about one quarter of the undergraduate student population!

Additionally, the campus-wide power strip retrofit will affect over 5,000 work stations throughout the University.

University of Florida,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 09:06:26,miwilliams@ufl.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Gator Gears Student Bicycle Rental Program,"Overview: 

Gator Gears is an innovative student bicycle rental program designed to provide students with access to high quality, well-maintained bicycles at an accessible cost. A primary goal of the program is to inspire enrolled students to see cycling as a viable and preferable alternative to motor vehicle transportation. Gator Gears seeks to turn novice cyclists into dedicated cycle-commuters. Because the program is targeted at cyclists who may not much experience with bicycles a primary form of transportation  it is vitally important that they have a positive experience with cycle commuting. To achieve this goal, the program focuses on making sure that its participants have a comfortable, stylish, reliable and functional bike that is always ready to ride. 

Bikes:

The University of Florida’s Office of Sustainability partnered with a bicycle manufacturer to provide unique, custom bicycles for the program, giving participants everything they need in a commuting bicycle, and nothing they don’t. Designed for efficiency, convenience and durability, the bicycles each feature a custom branded paint job, front and rear fenders, front basket, rear rack, chain guard and three-speed internally geared rear hub. By providing a bicycle that is simple to operate the program hopes to flatten the learning curve associated with more complex shifting systems while still providing an efficient ride that can handle the terrain in the area. 

Maintenance:

The program has hired and trained intern mechanics to provide free on-call repair service to participants, wherever their bike breaks down on campus. Participants can request repairs by completing a web form located at the Gator Gears web portal or calling in to the Office of Sustainability. This unique aspect of Gator Gears ensures that all fleet bikes are up and running as often as possible with minimal inconvenience to participants. 

Fiscal:

Because of our direct partnership with a manufacturer we were able to secure our custom bicycles at a very low cost. Assuming a full year’s rental fees, capital expenses will be repaid within 2.25 years. Bicycles are anticipated to last 4-5 years, allowing each bike to pay for itself and its replacement within its anticipated life cycle. This positive fiscal outlook is unique among cycling programs nationwide, which are often highly subsidized.

A brand new innovation center at the University of Houston Energy Research Park is offering students, staff and alumni a space to start their business.

“Physically I don’t think this space has any parallel”, said Wolff Center Director for Entrepreneurship Ken Jones.

In the past two years, entrepreneurial teams from UH have formed over a dozen companies. Dr. Mark Clarke, the Associate Vice President for Technology Transfer, saw a need for the new space.

“We didn’t build it with the hopes that they would come, we built it because they were already here,” Clarke said.

This new space allows those companies a place to grow without worrying about many of the concerns most start-ups face.

“The innovation center is a landing pad for the steam of entrepreneurial teams that we are creating internally so they can come and mature into successful companies,” Clarke said.

“We now have a wonderful opportunity for anyone that comes to UH to not only look at the idea, monetize the idea, but now have a home in which to make that idea work,” added Jones.

http://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2015/March/030415UHMInnovationCenter.php","A group of students in the Bauer College of Business Entrepreneurship program developed a business plan for a start-up called REEcycle. They are now running their start-up in incubation space located in the innovation center. The partnership between Energy Research Park, the Innovation Center and departments on campus is allowing research and ideas to be implemented into products, companies and services that are truly innovative and focused on sustainability and solutions to energy problems. 

Taken from a UH magazine article: ""The REEcycle business plan and startup is based on a technology developed by Allan Jacobson, Robert A. Welch Chair of Science and director of the Texas Center for Superconductivity at UH, who developed a way to extract rare earth elements from electronic waste. Rare earth elements are used in cell phones, computer hard drives, catalytic converters, wind power generators, energy efficient lighting and other “green” technologies.

Rare earth elements are generally not found in high concentrations, making it difficult to extract them economically. China controls more than 90 percent of the world’s supply, and Jacobson became interested in developing a way to recycle these after reading DOE reports about critical materials for future energy use. Jacobson discovered a chemical reaction that can extract the rare earth elements neodymium and dysprosium from discarded electronic waste.

REEcycle won first place at Baylor’s New Venture Competition, later repeating the feat in the Department of Energy’s (DOE) regional Clean Energy Business Plan Competition at the California Institute of Technology. They then won first place at the national DOE contest in Washington, D.C. (where the team took all three of the top prizes).""",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/38/6/585/3285/innovation-center-letter.pdf,**,True,True,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,http://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2014/June/0613REEcycleWins,--

Currently UIC has recycled over 2 tons of #5 polypropylene plastic.  Because this sort of plastic is not biologically or chemically contaminated, UIC is able to recycle it receive additional benefits from the recycling companies.  These include no tipping fee and receiving $100 per ton recycled because the recycling company can later sell this material because of its higher quality, and uncontaminated state.   This program is a highly sustainable initiative on campus because it reduces the amount of plastic that is landfilled, and also provides plastic recycling companies with plastic that would have otherwise been extracted from natural resources.

University of Louisville,2016-02-13,2016-02-13 03:03:00,justin.mog@louisville.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Beargrass Falls Environmental Park,"This innovative interdisciplinary collaboration between the University of Louisville (particularly UofL’s Kentucky Institute for the Environment & Sustainable Development and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering) and a variety of government agencies and community groups has helped turn Louisville’s polluted urban watershed into a living laboratory for exploring sustainable solutions and educating the public.
The Beargrass Falls Water Treatment Plant project is studying the feasibility of using a sustainable water treatment concept as an off-stream enhancement of urban stream water quality. The high-visibility project was designed to preclude the use of fossil fuels or any chemicals in the process of cleaning up the stream. The project is installed at a new environmental park for public education on water conservation, storm water runoff reduction and sustainable power sources. Since installation in the spring of 2014, educational sessions have been conducted on an on-going basis with students from local schools at all grade levels and also to the general public. 
With this experimental system designed by researchers at UofL, water is pumped directly from Beargrass Creek using a solar powered pump.  Water is stored in a 1200-gallon tank located 25 feet above the stream and allowed to flow through four separate filtering systems testing the effectiveness of different combinations of naturally available materials.  A post filtration mechanism exposes the water to sunlight by passing it through an open channel setting. The water then flows back into the creek over a waterfall that naturally oxygenates the water before it returns to the Creek.

The filtering system that worked best was a sand filter with a biofilm (Schmutzdecke) with a disinfectant trough painted with white paint to enhance UV filtration through the water column.  Bacteria reductions (e.coli) were achieved in the 90-95% range.  

Beargrass Falls is located at Karen Lynch Park, a Jefferson county park located in District 9, Louisville, Kentucky. Ninth District Louisville Metro Council Member Tina Ward-Pugh, Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) Executive Director Greg Heitzman, UofL researcher Russ Barnett, and others came together dedicate the site on Earth Day, April 22nd, 2014.

Beargrass Creek, which drains 61 square miles of Metro Louisville, has three forks—Muddy, Middle and South—that empty into the Ohio River. Much of the land in this watershed has been paved or built upon, and pollution and bacteria has built up in the stream for decades.

The goals of the park, located next to MSD’s Beargrass Creek Pump Station, are to improve water quality in the creek, serve as a site for environmental research, show people how to make sustainable choices and offer a model for other neighborhoods, its founders say.

Besides Louisville Metro’s Ninth District, MSD and UofL, the Butchertown Neighborhood Association, WaterStep, Girl Scouts of Kentuckiana, Louisville Metro Parks, Jefferson County Cooperative Extension Service, Get Outdoors Kentucky, Youth Build Louisville, University of Kentucky and others have contributed to the park’s development.

Under the agreement, four UMass campuses serve as host communities to new Solar Photovoltaic (Solar PV) electric generating projects. In return, the campuses receive an energy credit on their monthly utility bill. 

The UMass system has installed more than the total amount of Solar PV systems installed in 35 of the 50 U.S. states (40 MWs of new Solar PV made possible by the participation of the Amherst, Dartmouth, Lowell and Worcester campuses.)  Specific to UMass Amherst, a solar project which came online at the Fairview Farm in Whately, MA in July, 2014, will save the University of Massachusetts between $60,000 and $75,000 a year in electric costs as well as help the farmer leasing his land and the town.  The installation will produce 2.4 megawatts of solar energy a year, and provide enough solar energy annually to power what is the equivalent of the needs of nearly 300 homes. All the electricity produced is being sold to UMass.  The project is also a tax benefit to Whately.  Farmers here have three to four month periods of no income, and the regular income from this project will help even out the seasonal variability.

Statewide and system wide, a portion of the cost savings will be used to finance additional energy efficiency measures that will enable UMass to further reduce energy use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and help control energy costs.

Benefits from this program include but not limited to: The introduction to Green chemistry practices that our students and industry are expecting,	Reduced consumption of energy and utilities, Reduction in use and generation of hazardous materials, Increase in use and recycling, Improved safety for lab students, faculty and staff The Sustainable Labs Program is an ongoing initiative, and for the purpose of this Innovation Credit we would like to focus on two new programs, the Shut the Sash campaign and the Ultra-Low Freezer Energy Conservation campaign. To reduce energy consumption and costs in all university laboratories, the Office of Campus Sustainability has launched the Shut the Sash awareness campaign. ""Shut the Sash"" reminds lab users to close the transparent barrier on chemical fume hoods when not in use to avoid unnecessary energy consumption. As part of the campaign, OCS is working with facility managers, safety coordinators, lab directors and students to place large, magnetic signs with reminders to close the sash on each unit. The goal is to achieve an overall energy reduction of 15 percent, equating to an avoidance of $2 million in energy costs and 9,531 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Two models of fume hoods are used in campus laboratories: Constant Air Volume (CAV) and Variable Air Volume (VAV). While both models will display the awareness signage, OCS representatives anticipate the VAV model's design will offer the greatest energy conservation — up to 50 percent — when the sash is closed because the unit's fan speed and volume of air being exhausted also is reduced. Ultra Low Temperature (ULT) freezers are common in life sciences, biochemistry and biology laboratories. They are not only expensive to procure, but also have significant operating costs and can account for 5% or more of a laboratory’s electricity use. Samples like DNA, RNA, antigens, bacteria, viruses, cell liners and more are being stored in these freezers. Today most ULT freezers operate between -80 and -86 C. Energy costs to run a ULT freezer vary from $750 to $1000/year and there are more than 1000 ULT freezers on our campus. Historically, the first ULT freezers operated at -60 C. 15 to 20 years ago most ULT freezers were running at -70 C and were referred to as ‘minus seventies. It is only recently that the modern -80 ULT freezers have become the industry norm. With energy conservation in mind, many higher education institutions are now looking at the option of raising the temperature of ULT freezers by 10 C without compromising the quality of research. Raising the temperature by 10 C has shown to save 10 to 15% of a freezer’s electricity costs and possibly up to 30% for some older freezer models. Studies have shown that DNA samples are stable with little or no denaturing when stored at temperatures as high as -20 C over 24 months. In a related study (Miller et. al.) have demonstrated that DNA, RNA, antigens and viruses are stable for twenty years at -70 C. Studies conducted at Wiley lab, University of Colorado also support that the above materials including competent cells are stable at -70 C for longer periods. Benefits of raising the temperature on ULT freezers to -70 C include: Up to 30% on energy savings Longer compressor life Less heat is generated in the laboratory.",,**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/344/6/585/3285/4-22-15%20Letter%20of%20Support%20for%20Sudhakar.PDF,**,--,True,True,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--

What has remained elusive is a way to grow the biomass needed to make biofuel without encroaching on land dedicated to food crops, and how to transport and refine the biomass profitably. Big energy challenges like these require big ideas and even bigger collaborations— and Mizzou’ Advantage researcher Shibu Jose has both.

Jose, director of the Center for Agroforestry at the University of Missouri, is the leader of the Mississippi/Missouri River Advanced Biomass/Biofuel Consortium, a team of more than 40 academic institutions and agricultural and energy companies working to turn the Missouri and Mississippi rivers into a “biomass corridor” that will provide clean energy for the U.S. and economic opportunity for Missouri.

Mizzou Advantage is proud to be a sponsor of Jose’s preliminary research into biomass plantations, as well as a continuing partner in pursuing grants and other opportunities to apply the research to real-world problems in the Midwest and beyond.

The cycle begins with cultivating the marginal land along the rivers, where traditional food crops fail but native biomass crops like cottenwood and miscanthus flourish. MU’s extensive research in biomass crop performance allows the plant selection to be tailored to each site. Because the plants grow close to the river, the material can be transported by barge to refineries — which are also built along the river — at a fraction of the price of trucking it. An affordable way to transport energy crops is essential to making biomass production feasible for growers.

“In the past, we used to do all of these things for the sake of conservation, now we are also telling land owners you can still get that conservation benefit with a crop you can sell; it’s a market-based approach to conservation,” Jose said.

Jose says recently completed preliminary research shows that America’s two great rivers can support an effort to economically take biofuels from plants harvested in waste ground to finished biofuel pumped into fuel tanks. The organization’s next step is to find funding to build a prototype bio-processing facility that will create the first gallon.

If implemented, the plan could create about two-thirds of the 21 billion gallons of biofuels called for in federal goals by 2022, he says.","Jose said the preliminary research shows there are about 116 million acres of marginal land near these rivers that is unsuitable for traditional crops because of flooding, erosion and poor soil. This method of production is environmentally friendly, Jose said.  Many of these plants require little to no fertilizer. Most are soil stabilizing plants, holding the soil in place.

Jose estimated that planting biomass crops on six million acres – just five percent of the marginal land available around the rivers – would produce enough raw material to be converted into seven billion gallons of biofuel.",**,True,True,True,True,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/125/6/585/3285/Innovation4.pdf,**,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,--,True,--,True,--,--,--,--,Consortium,http://cafnrnews.com/2012/07/river-fuel/,http://mizzouadvantage.missouri.edu/project/bio2cor-the-biomassbiofuel-corridor-along-the-mississippimissouri-river/

As a link between north and south, east and west, the development sits at a critical junction. Emphasis on holistic and integrated planning and construction resulted in an inviting, high performance, and resource-efficient space. Constructed on a former 6-acre surface parking lot, the Bell Tower Development includes the Genome Sciences Building, a multi-story parking deck, and a multipurpose, landscaped amphitheater. The project exemplifies many of the guiding principles of the Campus Master Plan.

The new development lies on the border between the College of Arts and Sciences and the five health affairs schools, where basic research meets clinical applications. Researchers from departments as diverse as biology, chemistry, computer science and statistics interact with each other, as well as colleagues from the schools of medicine, pharmacy, and public health in the Genome Sciences building.

The new 210,000 square foot Genome Sciences Building consists of office and classroom spaces and research facilities, including greenhouses. The LEED Gold building features a green roof, high-performance glazing, integrated shading devices, and active chilled beams. A cafe in the lobby of the building serves Fair Trade coffee
and looks out over a newly created landscaped amphitheater.

Rainwater collected from the roof of the Genome Sciences Building drains to a 350,000 gallon, stone-filled cistern beneath the Bell Tower Amphitheater. Following UV treatment and chlorination, the rainwater is used to flush 1000 toilets in the Genome Sciences Building and Kenan Stadium. When rainwater is insufficient, reclaimed wastewater from the local water utility provides a non-potable backup. Concrete vaults detain ground-level stormwater. Short-term storage reduces downstream erosion, flooding, and pollutant loading.

The Bell Tower Parking Deck uses solar photovoltaic panels, funded by the student green energy fee, to light the stairwells. Deck lighting is provided by LEDs.","The Genome Sciences Building is LEED Gold certified and:
- uses 72% less potable water than standard buildings of comparable size.
- is the first campus building to use chilled beams to provide cooling independent of the ventilation system.
- 90% of on-site generated construction was was recycled. 
- at least 50% of the wood used is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.

The landscaped amphitheater/central park provides a new green gathering space in the center of campus. It's the new home for Tar Heel Town activities help prior to football games in the adjacent Kenan Stadium.

"University of North Carolina, Greensboro",2016-01-26,2016-01-26 15:33:31,cgcarwei@uncg.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Sustainable Materials Library,"The Interior Architecture Department at UNCG has led the university in teaching sustainability to its students and promoting sustainable practices on campus. Over the past few years, IARc has developed a powerful resource to further advance these efforts, leading to UNCG becoming the only school with sustainable building material samples cataloged through the campus library. Paired with physical samples of many of these materials, the Sustainable Materials library provides a valuable resource for students, faculty, staff and the community to investigate sustainable options for interior projects. 

This thoroughly organized collection of interior finishes is searchable via electronic catalog. Protocol sheets within the catalog detail each material’s sustainability attributes, ranging from production and harvesting practices to toxic chemical content to embodied energy factors such as transportation distance. The library equips students to make better-informed decisions about materials they use for projects and to support UNCG’s commitment to sustainability.

The IARc library is also unique because it is catalogued through the university library system. Because the Library of Congress has no procedure for organizing this type of inventory, Mary Jane Conger of the UNCG Jackson Library helped IARc establish a new cataloging scheme. The materials library catalog is searchable through the UNCG Libraries catalog, with entries including the protocol sheets as well as links to material manufacturers’ websites.

The library is also a living laboratory. The cataloging scheme integrates a standardized coding system developed by the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) – an industry standard. All UNCG interior architecture students must learn the CSI system to use the catalog, leaving them better prepared for careers in the field. Further, students in the Materials, Methods, and Technology course must acquire two green materials for the library and complete a protocol sheet that includes the manufacturer information, life cycle analysis, sustainable qualities, and contact information for those wishing to order samples. To accomplish this, students must contact companies to obtain the material samples; the experience of dealing directly with the suppliers helps students learn how to be discerning about business practices and sustainability factors. The library grows as students add about material samples annually, and students get an opportunity to make an original contribution to their field.

While the library itself is intended for student use, the electronic catalog provides valuable information for the community at large. Anyone may access the catalog and protocol sheets.

University of South Florida,2016-02-26,2016-02-26 13:29:48,sustainability@usf.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Campus Tree Mapping,"

The sustainability of Florida's urban and community trees and forests requires meaningful public participation. As evidenced by successful citizen-based scientific monitoring efforts, public participation can include environmental mapping and monitoring. In Florida and nationwide, the majority of communities and college campuses lack the resources to develop one the most fundamental urban forest management tools: the tree inventory. This project developed the technology and training materials to enable citizen-based tree inventory initiatives, and make this technology available to all college campuses and communities in Florida. This project leverage existing partnerships between individual and organizations engaged in education, research and management efforts focused on urban trees and forests. Project collaborators included: faculty, staff and students from the University of South Florida; researchers from the University of Florida (UF) and the UF-IFAS/ Hillsborough Extension Service (Extension); Natural Resources staff from the City of Tampa (Tampa); and representatives from the USF Tree Campus Advisory Committee. The project was funded by a grant from the USDA Forest Service under the management of the Florida Forest Service, as well as the City of Tampa, Florida.

This project implemented and customized an existing open-source web-based tree inventory data mapping and management technology, implemented and tested a smartphone enabled field data collection application, and imported and exported tree inventory data to and from existing software applications in the Tree Inventory Data Mapping and Management Tool. The TampaTreeMap.org (a version of the open-source OpenTreeMap project) is a web-based tree inventory data mapping and management tool for the geographic area of the City of Tampa and the University of South Florida. This open-source software was designed to provide the fundamental technology necessary for online mapping of field-based tree inventory data collected by the public and professional foresters such as City of Tampa and USF staff. The tools developed, implemented and tested for this project can be shared freely and used by all Florida communities who implement the software.

This project leveraged the local knowledge and expertise of university faculty and staff who created training materials that shows users how to conduct a tree inventory using the TampaTreeMap.org technology developed as part of this project. The training materials include a visual key of common urban tree species found in the Tampa area. Future users will be able to modify the tree key to add species found in other regions of Florida. The training materials also include an illustrative guide to collecting additional tree measurements, including D.B.H., tree height, crown height and width, crown condition and measurement of surrounding environmental variables. Short training videos are being produced by Extension that demonstrates the use of the technology and the collection of field data. A training program is currently under development that will teach neighborhood association members and other groups of people lacking forestry experience how to conduct a tree inventory using the technology. Finally, the visual key and training materials are accessible to mobile users via an iOS (i.e., iPhone) app and web pages designed to be compatible with mobile devices.

The success of this project will be measured by the use of the final products to facilitate successful tree inventory efforts in Florida campuses and communities. A central strength of this project is that USF students and volunteers participated by testing the technology and training materials to conduct a tree inventory of a portion of the University of South Florida's Tampa campus. Students provided guidance to improve the design of technology and training materials, and learned important concepts and practices.

The financial model also identifies sustainable funding to support a new generation of faculty and components of the Cornerstone Plan, U.Va.’s strategic plan. In advance of the financing, all three major credit rating agencies – Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s – reaffirmed the University’s coveted “triple-A” long-term debt rating, a key to U.Va.’s ability to save millions in interest by securing the most favorable terms available to institutions with the top ratings.

Production of Titan Gold started in August of 2015. Titan Gold is unique in that it is not animal waste-based compost, which is a typical product of anaerobic digestion systems that serve large animal waste facilities. Finding a solution for solids outputs from anaerobic digestion systems is a challenge nationally, and Titan Gold serves as a model for the conversion of AD solids to a value-added product.

Initially, AD solids from the UW-Oshkosh Foundation Biodigester realized no market value. Through local partnerships, the AD solids have been composted after the anaerobic digestion process at a site off-campus, and then returned to campus for further processing and screening. Titan Gold is tested the Enrvironmental Research and Innovation Center (ERIC) at UW-Oshkosh. The ERIC lab is one of ten nationally-certified Seal of Testing Assurance Standards (STA) labs. The product can then be bagged, sold and distributed. Titan Gold is a registered trademark in Wisconsin, and has been submitted for a federally-registered trademark.

Students can purchase a food container for $6.00. Each time the container is used, the student receives a $0.50 discount on their food purchase and will be making money after their 13th purchase.

The dirty container is returned to the food court and the student is given a validation ticket to hand to the food service worker when they next want to purchase food in a “Green on the Go” container. Used containers are washed and ready to be handed out again.

This program is also available to faculty and staff of the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point.","We expect to spend less on current Earthchoice compostable drink ware and service ware for take out food; however, specific data is not available.

The original program established to catch those who are exhibiting positive, sustainable actions - such as using a reusable mug or recycling. The program has been enhanced to include catching people in the act of not being sustainable, especially in our University Center.

This allows us to engage with students in a positive, lighthearted manner while educating them on easy sustainable changes, usually with an incentive of a free eco-clam or coffee cup to use.

Warren Wilson College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:30:13,aclimo@warren-wilson.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Nurturing a living memory of African-American history in Western North Carolina and promoting awareness about it,"The idea behind the website (southashevillecemetery.net) is to “nurture a living memory of African-American history in this region and promote awareness about it,” says global studies professor Jeff Keith, who led the project. “It’s a place of great spiritual and historical value. My goal is to celebrate that. I’m hoping the website can make it a place that people can access, even if they don’t come to Dalton Street. My hope is that this will result in it being maintained forever.”

Keith’s student team built on the work done by archaeology professor David Moore and his students. Throughout the late ’90s and early 2000s, they probed the ground to discover and catalog the graves, all but 93 of which lacked tombstones. Because the bodies were often buried in pine coffins and wicker baskets, however, they decomposed quickly, leaving measurable cavities in the earth.

The archaeology team pinpointed where the bodies had been placed. But their blueprint remained largely inaccessible to the public until the new website harnessed GIS and Google Earth technology to readily display the map to anyone with computer access. Users can now explore the cemetery digitally, zooming in on each grave and clicking it to see what information archaeologists were able to unearth.

That data, however, is limited: The digital record indicates whether there’s a carved tombstone, a simple unmarked fieldstone or any other noticeable marking. Any information on the headstones is recorded. Some give names as well as birth and death dates; others bear only simple carved hints, such as “mother” or “our darling.” It isn’t known how many of the deceased were slaves.

“I find it fantastic to use the tools of the 21st century to tell stories of the 19th century. It’s also a huge challenge,” says Keith. “This is a unique effort in Western North Carolina. I don’t know of another African-American cemetery that’s being investigated this way.”
Although much of that history has been “lost to time,” notes Keith, “The cemetery offers some clues to what African-Americans have done for Buncombe County.”

A dozen or so stones, for example, are marked with masonic symbols suggesting, he says, “that there were builders there who probably contributed to some of the iconic buildings of downtown Asheville.” And the sheer scale of the burial ground, continues Keith, also goes a long way toward countering the claim that slavery barely existed here. Because WNC lacked the large-scale plantations that popular culture often associates with the institution of bondage, he says, he often encounters people who believe there was no slavery in the mountains.

“I think Appalachia, as a place, is often racialized to be white by media representations. … Sometimes people move here and they don’t have a clear awareness of the tremendous contributions that African-Americans made to this place,” says Keith. “We have segregated imaginations: We think about the past in ways that are limited by our assumptions. But when you really engage with the past, you find all kinds of exciting stories that defy those assumptions.” The cemetery, he adds, “prompts people to ask questions about the past that they might not otherwise consider.”
","A .KML file was created that allows people to see the grave soundings on Google Earth, while the map also fuses information about what--if any--gravestones marked the site at the time of the initial mapping. 

A website resulted from the work of thirteen students and three faculty members at Warren Wilson College who embarked on an experimental interdisciplinary program called the Appalachian Semester.  The course instructors--David Ellum, Jeff Keith, and Catherine Reid--taught a set of four interrelated courses about Appalachian landscapes that all thirteen students took during the spring semester of 2014. This meant, among other things, that the students were able to participate in numerous field trips throughout the semester. One class, entitled ""Engaging Appalachia,"" made a sustained commitment to working at the South Asheville Cemetery.  Aside from participating in clearing efforts on a bi-weekly basis, the students started a fencing project around the cemetery's perimeter, and they contributed to the creation of this website through research and organizational efforts.

Western Michigan University,2016-02-24,2016-02-24 12:21:47,jeffrey.spoelstra@wmich.edu,2.0,Pursuing,Curriculum,"President Dunn signed the Talloires Declaration in 2008 initiating a focus on curriculum and environmental literacy. The Sustainability Across Research & Teaching (StART) Initiative was created to help faculty members secure what they need to foster the infusion and integration of sustainability across research and teaching. The President's Universitywide Sustainability Committee (PUSC) was created and the Office for Sustainability (OfS) administered a campuswide faculty survey early in 2012 to identify challenges and opportunities for broad-scale integration of sustainability.  The survey results were used to set the agenda for four faculty luncheons, which engaged 42 faculty members from all seven colleges. Concurrent graduate student research explored needs, opportunities for program development, and support mechanisms. We now have 139 faculty from 32 departments engaged in sustainability research and 15 new sustainability-related or –focused courses were approved this year.

Survey respondents identified a long list of critical needs and barriers and luncheon participants prioritized actionable initiatives including the creation of an institute-like structure, an ongoing peer-to-peer faculty learning group, and a mechanism to regularly track what is happening universitywide in curriculum and research.  Following from the need for a peer-to-peer faculty learning group the OfS and Office for Faculty Development created StART II, a sustainability Faculty Learning Community, which is already acting on the infusion and integration of sustainability into individual courses. An annual spring event (speaker, workshop, etc.) was also created to further support faculty sustainability efforts. We also initiated a multi year global review of Sustainability Core Competencies, which resulted in a 3 ½ hour workshop at the last AASHE meeting that was attended by over 110 people. And the Office for Sustainability is creating and improving mechanisms to report regularly on campuswide sustainability activities and champions.

Faculty interests are many and varied. Current faculty learning communities center around pursuing climate neutrality, creating transportation systems that support more liveable communities, expanding local foods infrastructure, addressing social justice and equity, and supporting local living economies. As a result of these discussions and collaborations, faculty are seeing new opportunities for leveraging sustainability commitments in their own coursework, research, and activism. Faculty in all colleges have appreciated “old fashioned” face-to-face interactions with like-minded peers that they might not otherwise meet.","Building on our momentum, we are excited to report that we are exploring opportunities: 1) for the creation of a graduate certificate program; 2) for an update to the General Education program; 3) with a newly identified sustainability focus area in our Office of the Vice President for Research; and, 4) for more formalized support from the WMU Faculty Senate to accelerate sustainability infusion across teaching and research.
