Gray at American University’s LEED-Gold certified School of International Service Building to sign the District of Columbia Mayor’s College and University Sustainability Pledge (CUSP).

This university-based collaborative approach to sustainability is the first of its kind in the nation. DC is the first city in the U.S. to form such a compact between its entire higher education sector and its local government to advance sustainability. Working together in this public/private partnership, the signatories will work to make the District of Columbia the ‘Greenest College Town in America.’

The pledge is an agreement by the schools to pursue a range of sustainability measures related to energy use and buildings, green education, transportation, waste reduction, grounds maintenance, purchasing, and the monitoring and reporting of progress.

As a sector, universities in the District are already leading in the area of sustainability. LEED-certified buildings, solar panels and green roofs grace campuses throughout the city, universities are already using renewable energy, and several have already announced carbon neutral plans to greatly reduce their carbon footprint.

Our Mission
We are dedicated to advancing the environmental, energy and economic security of Central and Northern Arizona by advocating and participating in practices that promote clean domestic energy and reduce dependence on conventional petroleum based fuels.

History of our Coalition
The Maricopa Association of Governments joined the Department of Energy's Clean Cities Program in 1997. The Clean Cities Program was created by the federal Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) to support voluntary efforts by government and business to reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil. There are now over eighty coalitions nationwide.

In July 2001, Maricopa Association of Governments handed over the Clean Cities operation to a group of independent stakeholders representing local industry and government. This group was re-chartered by DOE under the new name, Valley of the Sun Clean Cities Coalition. This new and improved coalition emerged with an innovative vision and strategic plan for cleaner air and a future less dependent on petroleum. Today, the coalition's stakeholders represent more than sixty government, utility, and business organizations.

The VSCCC's stakeholders operate nearly 7,000 alternative fuel vehicles and displace some 51 million gallons of petroleum fuel annually with alternative fuels such as natural gas, biodiesel, propane, ethanol, and electricity. According to a 2010 survey, this represents 10% of the annual consumption of alternative transportation fuel in the U.S.
ASU is a partner member of the DOE Clean Cities Coalition. Dr. James Anderson, a Senior Sustainability Scientist at ASU, serves on the Board of Directors.

Curriculum, Campus & Community
The Sustainability Science for Sustainable Schools program at Arizona State University includes a collection of graduate students, high school teachers and sustainability researchers. Together we strive to further sustainability science by bringing sustainability projects into our high schools’ curriculum, campuses, and larger communities.  We believe that by teaching sustainability science to high school students, we can help promote a sustainable future for the Phoenix metro area.

Our program seeks to:
Increase integration of sustainability into instructional development.
Graduate fellows work with teachers and district leadership to engage in delivery of interdisciplinary curriculum and project based learning. Fellows bring state-of-the-art sustainability science research to teachers to strengthen STEM teaching, which in turn advances the STEM skills of high school students.
Expand university outreach and relationships with high schools.
Partnerships are developed with high school districts to strengthen the delivery of STEM education and build the capacity of teachers and students to implement project-based sustainability projects.
Enhance fellows’ graduate experience and career trajectories.
Graduate fellows are exposed to real-world experiences that enhance their training and career trajectories. Weekly work in the classroom is supplemented by outreach activities to public and private entities, allowing fellows to gain experience presenting sustainability content to a wide range of audiences.
Improve graduate students’ communication and teaching skills. 
Graduate students are empowered to be better sustainability educators through training in curriculum development and collaborative instructional strategies. Fellows work in interdisciplinary teams and hone their skills in communication, collaboration, problem solving, conflict resolution and project management.

SustainabilityConnect is an outlet for individuals within the Arizona State University community and the broader Phoenix Metro Area to come together and work collaboratively to address real-world sustainability issues. At SustainabilityConnect we specialize in helping individuals and organizations realize their sustainability goals by creating and coordinating sustainability projects and then archiving them in our database. Any ASU student, faculty, staff, or community partner can submit a project proposal or search the database for a project that they would like to participate in. Our goal at SustainabilityConnect is to foster collaboration between academic and professional experts while providing students with an applied learning environment.
Our goal at SustainabilityConnect is to assist those who join (our members) in realizing valuable contributions to their and other's sustainability initiatives and to foster university-community collaborations. Any individual can become a member of SustainabilityConnect -- ASU students, faculty, and staff, as well as professionals from the wider public and surrounding community.

Our projects address sustainability problems, which are inherently complex but are critical to address thoroughly because business-as-usual approaches often cause irreversible harm to the vitality of specific ecosystems and groups of people. Solid solutions are typically difficult to uncover because the problems have multiple and interrelated causes and impacts that harbor tensions between social, economic, and environmental domains stretching across local, national, and even global levels. These problems are urgent because the impact on current populations and ecosystems are usually worsening rapidly and threatening the livelihood of future generations. Sustainability problems are often contested because affected and benefiting stakeholders have diverse viewpoints on what and who causes and should remediate these problems.

Addressing sustainability problems and developing solutions to them is overwhelming for one person given the complexity and steps involved. Therefore, we create teams to bring various skills and competencies together. Because we tailor each project to the specific needs of our partners and the educational requirements of our students, each project will require different types of collaboration with varying participants, timeframes, and commitments.

The Muncie Action Plan is a strategic guide that expresses the values and aspirations of our community, while creating a compelling action agenda for the future. More than 100 volunteers donated hundreds of hours of their time to ensure that the Plan was an open process representing all community demographics. The Plan includes long-term goals and measurable action steps which will accomplish a realistic vision and uphold the values identified by our community.  Indeed, the public has been involved every step of the way; first to generate ideas, next to articulate values, and finally to affirm goals and actions.

Recommendations from the community, accompanied by extensive factual analysis of trends and conditions, form the basis of the Plan. The Plan is divided into five initiative areas each with specific action steps designed to realize the vision of a stronger, better Muncie. The Plan will be used by the community as public and private decisions are made concerning development, redevelopment, capital improvements, and other matters affecting the well-being of the community. The Plan will be used as the Delaware-Muncie Metropolitan Plan Commission begins working on a Comprehensive Plan update. It will be used by the City’s Community Development Department as it prioritizes projects and funding.

The Plan encourages cooperation and neighborhood development. It recognizes that the whole community is responsible for education, community image and identity, economic development and for the effective use of community resources. To our knowledge it is the first city-wide strategic plan and has had unprecedented success in involving the whole community. The Plan strongly recommends an integrated approach to land use and reuse so that decisions are not made in isolation; rather, each decision should consider its impact on other areas (neighborhoods, pedestrian movement, educating the public) and be examined through the lens of the Plan’s goals, principles, and action steps.

Here is a quick snapshot that describes the programs:

•The Green Workplace Challenge has a regional scope, including all ten counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania, whereas the Pittsburgh 2030 Districts focus primarily on Pittsburgh’s Golden Triangle and Oakland districts.

•The GWC is a year-to-year competition; Pittsburgh 2030 Districts have a long-term focus.

•The GWC’s competition guidebook is a “Ready-Made” checklist of green actions for organizations to implement. The 2030 Districts involve each building’s individual building strategy plans.

•The GWC has an emphasis on occupied space, which encompasses both tenants and building managers. The 2030 District has an emphasis on entire facilities, which mainly involves the owners of those facilities.

•The actions outlined in the GWC competition manual are based on short term implementation, which affect day-to-day operations, practice and culture. The implementation of the 2030 District goals are more tied to the full-life cycle of the building, such as equipment capital investments, e.g. a new roof, HVAC system etc.

•While both programs use the EPA’s Portfolio Manager as the measurement tool, the GWC’s measurement comparison is actual usage, from year to year. The 2030 District measurement comparison is based on the cumulative performance vs. an industry average benchmark year 2003.

The Pittsburgh Green Workplace Challenge’s ready-made guidebook of sustainable actions provides a guideline for organizations to track and actively measure there progress in energy, water, air quality, waste and transportation. The measurements and reductions that result from actions taken throughout the Green Workplace Challenge will aide in the progress towards Pittsburgh 2030 District goals.

Cornell University Cooperative Extension-New York City (CUCE-NYC) planned and developed a professional development and informal science education program that involves multicultural and intergenerational learning among educators, youth, and adult gardeners in community garden settings. The program also includes action projects, science investigations, citizen science data collection and reporting on national databases. The program focuses on plants and planting practices with an emphasis on food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability.

Local Roads Program (http://www.clrp.cornell.edu/)
The Cornell Local Roads Program's roots go back to the 1920s when in 1923 the Civil Engineering Department at Cornell University held a conference on highway engineering. The first School for Highway Superintendents was held in 1938, the second in 1940. A few years were skipped during the war, and then the School began annual meetings in 1947.

Today, the Local Roads Program is one of 58 Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers established by the Federal Highway Administration. We are sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration and the New York State Department of Transportation, with additional funding provided by Cornell University, and participants' training fees. We provide training and technical assistance to local highway and public works officials in New York State. 

Professor Rebecca Schneider’s lab in Cornell’s Department of Natural Resources has studied how roadside ditches contribute to flooding, droughts, and degraded water quality in downstream waters. Her research lab has documented that roadside ditches are a significant, rapid conduit of E. coli, a fecal indicator bacteria, from different land uses, particularly from manure-amended agriculture, to streams and drinking water sources. The relevant stakeholders include town planners, local town government officials, and highway department staff. The results have been conveyed via in-person presentations and workshops with local (village, town and county) highway and public works supervisors and other local officials. Many of these workshops were hosted by the Cornell Local Roads Program.

Invasive Species Program (http://www.invasiveplants.net/)
The New York State Invasive Species Research Institute (ISRI), hosted by Cornell’s Department of Natural Resources and Cornell Cooperative Extension’s Invasive Species Outreach Program provide statewide programming on invasive species of concern to New York State. Research results are disseminated more broadly and readily through the ISRI, and multi-county collaborations of natural resource professionals (PRISMs) are served by the Invasive Species Outreach Program. For example, the Department of Natural Resources conducted more than 20 workshops across the state in 2010 on the emerald ash borer, including information on life cycle, detection, monitoring, and control. Audiences served included professional foresters, public natural resources managers, landowners, not-for-profits, and farmers. A Web site (nyis.info) provides detailed species descriptions, print on demand handouts, and partner information and contacts. Cornell Cooperative Extension educators are active in the PRISMs.

Cornell Cooperative Extension, Tompkins County, Local Foods
The concept “local foods” refers to foods produced close to the point of consumption. Cornell Cooperative Extension promotes local foods in its nutrition, agriculture, and community development programs, connecting producers, consumers, and local economic developers, supporting farmers markets, producing guides to local foods, and educating consumers on preparation of fresh foods. Expansion of local foods has implications for local economic development and sustainability in addition to potential nutritional benefits.  (http://ccetompkins.org/agriculture/buy-local)

The Whole Community Project
The Cornell Division of Nutritional Sciences is taking an ecological approach to obesity prevention. Traditional approaches focus on education and individual behavior change, which may be hampered by environment, such as presence of vending machines in schools, family eating habits, or lack of access to exercise opportunities. An ecological approach includes changing food and activity environments to support and enable healthy eating and active living. Extension educators receive professional development and have access to materials and other support from researchers and Extension faculty. The ecological approach to preventing childhood obesity is supported by Farm to School and 4-H Youth Development programs on healthy eating.  http://www.ithaca.com/news/local_news/ithaca-s-whole-community-project-provides-healthy-food/image_44335c00-8fec-58d1-9d6b-25d4a0fc34dd.html, http://nyevents.us/ithaca-thousands-of-one-congo-square-market/134731

For instance, Wilderness Outdoor Opportunities for Durham Students (WOODS) is a program that is run by Duke students promoting nature and environmental experiential education in the Durham area. The goal of WOODS is not only to educate the children they work with, but to help them gain a sense of self-worth and build their self-esteem. Aspects of ecology, the environment, and basic natural principles are taught through team building exercises, games, and spending time outdoors.

In a partnership between Duke University (in particular the grounds team within Facilities Management), Durham's city government and Keep Durham Beautiful, Duke has assisted the ""Trees Across Durham"" campaign.  The Duke Campus Farm provided a space for 63 young willow oaks to grow from local acorns for two years, and provided volunteers to help transplant these trees as they are moved to parks and schools around Durham. ",True,"The Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative is conducting research and implementing a pilot program to determine how residential energy efficiency can provide social and economic benefits to the surrounding communities while also providing energy efficiency credits or carbon offsets to help Duke University become climate neutral by 2024.

Duke University’s Carbon Offsets Initiative (DCOI) has partnered with the Clinton Climate Initiative to bring a customized version of the Home Energy Affordability Loan program (HEAL) to a select number of Duke employees. The DCOI-HEAL program is offering free home energy assessments and Personal Energy Plans (a $500 value) to a limited number of Duke University employees in Durham County.

By participating in this program, employees have the opportunity to save energy and money within their homes and help Duke University meet its goal to become carbon neutral by 2024.

The first round of the pilot resulted in energy usage reductions of an average of thirteen percent in the seven homes.  DCOI is currently seeking 20 additional employees to participated in a second round of the pilot. ",True,"The Office of Durham and Regional Affairs is home to the Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership and the Community Service Center. Duke’s Board of Trustees created the office in 2008 to expand and deepen the university’s engagement with Durham Public Schools, the City of Durham, local neighborhoods and non-profits, and the region at large.

Durham and Regional Affairs staff members work to build and sustain partnerships and programming that advance community goals, with a special focus on local youth, K-12 education and economic development.

Duke’s support for Durham Public Schools is broad. We celebrate the ingenuity of Durham’s students through initiatives like the Duke Regional Spelling Bee; advance the professional development and community connections of school staff through programs like Visions; and respond to schools’ most pressing needs through a range of programs that address kindergarten readiness, early literacy and Latino student engagement.

Support for local schools is a natural part of Duke’s mission as an educational institution. We believe Duke’s engagement with public schools not only enhances the education of local youth; it enriches the lives of Duke students, faculty and staff.

It’s impossible to fully capture or quantify the close ties between Duke and Durham, or the endless exchange of knowledge, relationships, business and ideas. Here are a few examples of Duke’s roles as a neighbor, employer, investor and partner in Durham:
--Through the Southside Housing Incentive Program, Duke is supporting the City of Durham’s efforts to revitalize the historic Southside neighborhood while providing high-quality housing to its own middle-income employees.
--Since Duke and Self-Help entered into a loan agreement in 1994, more than 220 units of affordable housing have been built in the Walltown and Southwest Central Durham communities, with input from neighbors and support from local non-profit developers. 
--With funding from Duke, the City of Durham and the federal government, the Bull City Connector bus route launched in 2010 to provide fare-free service between downtown, Duke Medical Center and the university. 
--The Maplewood Square apartment building opened in 2010 for low-income seniors living in the heart of Durham’s West End community. The project was a collaboration between the City of Durham, DHIC, Durham Community Land Trustees, Duke and Self-Help. 

Additionally, Duke University’s Office of Community Affairs directly coordinates the Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership. The Partnership, which was formed in 1996, has a focus on affordable home ownership, educational achievement, youth outreach, neighborhood safety, and quality health care. ","Many of the domestic and international programs offered to Duke students through Duke Engage are either focused on sustainability or include elements of sustainability.  DukeEngage empowers students to address critical human needs through immersive service, in the process transforming students, advancing the University’s educational mission, and providing meaningful assistance to communities in the U.S. and abroad.

Students each year participate in a vast range of civic engagement activities, including environmental advocacy, community outreach, global health, education, social justice and more.  Since 2007, students have:

• launched mentoring and school enrichment programs;

Drawing on the expertise of faculty members from several of GW’s schools and colleges, SWW teachers incorporate content focusing on food and nutrition into their coursework on history, physics, humanities, math, geography, French and biology. Additional teachers at SWW supplement the thirteen high school teachers enrolled in the curriculum building program for the more than 300 SWW students who are participating in the Project.

4. In addition, the Office of Sustainability, in partnership with Siemens Corporation, has partnered with School Without Walls Francis Stevens (SWWFS) elementary and middle school to expand their STEM-related curriculum and student activities. Siemens generously donated over 100 science kits that address renewable energy (solar and wind) and waste management practices as they regard climate change impacts. The kits are meant to engage SWWFS students both in the classroom and in after school programs.

5. The Rodham Institute, as part of the GW School of Medicine, is a community-centered organization whose mission is to partner with the local Washington D.C. community to achieve health equity by cultivating the next generation of community-oriented health care providers, and training them in innovative strategies to improve health care for all.

While there are many efforts and aspects of the Institute to highlight, for purposes of this discussion we chose to feature the Health Workforce Development project, specifically the Health Education Leadership Program.

The Health Education Leadership Program (HELP) is a bi-directional educational initiative that seeks to promote health profession careers among middle school students, encourage health and wellness among these students and their communities, and engage health professionals and trainees in service learning. 

In spring 2014, the Rodham Institute and community partners launched HELP. As part of the month-long pilot project, Internal Medicine residents from George Washington University met weekly with self-selected youth health leaders from schools in Wards 7 and 8 for a “train the trainers” activity. Residents utilized the Association of Black Cardiologists, Inc.’s 12-module curriculum on cardiovascular health as a basis to develop health leadership skills to empower youth to teach other community members about healthy behaviors to improve cardiovascular health. 

In July 2013, the Rodham Institute, in close partnership with the Calvin Coolidge High School Alumni Association and The South East Tennis & Learning Center, hosted a STEM-H Enrichment Day at George Washington University. More than 50 D.C.-area youth learned about careers in science, technology, engineering, math, and health through interactive sessions with mentors in these fields.   

In April 2014, the Rodham Institute collaborated with community partners to hold a week-long HELP program, drawing more than 200 attendees, including students from D.C. public schools, their parents, as well as health professionals and trainees. During this week, youth learned about careers opportunities in health, participated in field trips to health care organizations in D.C., and worked with public health and medicine trainees on “applied health equity” projects, and other health mentorship activities.",True,"Managed through the Honey W. Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service, the Civic House Academic Residential Community (ARC) is a program for first-year students interested in becoming active citizens engaged in their communities. The three core tenets of Civic House are live, learn, and serve. The program challenges students to learn about the unique cultures, strengths, and needs of communities in Washington, D.C. and to build collaborative relationships among students, faculty, and community-based organizations to meet needs and learn through service. All Civic House students will live together in West Hall on the Mount Vernon Campus. Civic House is a program of GW’s Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service.

Through Civic House, students are able to express their passion for service and social justice while participating in service-learning courses, advocacy development, and service projects. Students will work with non-profit organizations across the city through their service-learning coursework in University Writing 1020 and a number of service projects during the academic year. Additionally, Civic House students are encouraged to take an academic service-learning course during the spring semester while continuing their personal service commitments.","The GW Alternative Breaks program offers 6 winter break trips and 11 spring break trips to both domestic and international locations. Each trip has its own unique service area, from sustainability to education to labor rights. The pre-trip education component allows for GW students to delve into the situation they’ll find themselves in once they’re in the field doing service. Most trips feature service activities during the day, and bonding and exploring the area in the evenings. GW Alt Breaks trips offer GW students the opportunity to be global citizens and leaders while building lasting friendships with people from within and outside the GW community.

In just a week on an Alternative Breaks trip, individuals can make an impact in another community and meet a cohort of really genuine, dedicated students at GW. Participants become inspired by the stories of the transformative impact that this experience has both on GW student participants and on communities around the world.

Green Mountain College,2016-03-21,2016-03-21 15:55:13,ihrker@greenmtn.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Green Mountain College has several formal sustainability partnerships with the local community that meet the criteria of “supportive”. Students, faculty, and staff at GMC closely support some local area events, programs, and organizations including Poultney Food Shelf, Young-at-Heart Senior Center, the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, the local school district, the Wonderfeet Children’s Museum, the Flora Advisory Group for Vermont, the Rutland Farm and Food Center Market, the Rutland County Women’s Network and Shelter, the Home Ownership Center, Neighborhood Works, Positive Energy, and HSUS (The Humane Society of the United States). GMC demonstrates its support for these partnerships through the provision of volunteer services, research, and exchange of ideas. 

GMC supports the local food shelf through annual student-driven fundraisers, food can drives at the end of each semester, and provision of fresh organic produce from the campus farm during the summer time. 

Every fall and spring semesters, the community outreach office at GMC assists with the recruitment of student volunteers to help serve lunch meals every week to the local senior residents at Young-at-Heart Senior Center. In the fall ‘13 and spring ‘14, three to four students, together, contributed approximately 90 hours of service to the Senior Center.

Faculty and their classes often partner with the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department. For example, in 2013 and 2014 Associate Professor Teresa Coker partnered with the Department to offer environmental education programming through her classes. Other classes have done field work for the Department. Many students have interned there as well.

Professor Coker also recently partnered with the Wonderfeet Children's Museum in Rutland to offer outreach programs for Rutland schools.  

Several faculty and classes have partnered with the Poultney Elementary and Poultney High Schools on a range of projects and programs. 

Professor Jim Graves serves as the vice chair of the Flora Advisory Group for Vermont, which meets three times a year to assess rare and endangered plant species.

Each year, students in Kathy Doyle’s Forest Ecology Masters course reach out to a person involved in the management of a local forest in their region. As such, each student has a partnership with a local organization to complete their course project. These organizations have included the Green Mountain National Forest, Agency of Natural Resources, and Hubbard Brook Research Foundation.  

Adjunct Professor, Susanne Claxton, often works with the Rutland County Women's Network and Shelter. 

Adjunct Professor Ken Welch facilitates partnerships between GMC students and the Home Ownership Center, as well as Neighborhood Works. 

Professor Sam Edwards has partnered with HSUS through two of his classes to train the public in animal lobbying and humane investigation.


",True,"GMC has many collaborative partnerships with groups such as Poultney Historical Society, Poultney Earth Fair, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, Poultney Elementary School, Poultney High School, Stone Valley Arts, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, Rutland Regional Planning Commission, Poultney Mettowee Conservation District, Poultney Community Breakfast Program, and RAFFL's Glean Team.

In relation to the Poultney Historical Society, GMC believes that to the extent students get involved and acquainted with local and regional history, they will be able to understand, think creatively, and attempt to resolve the challenges that exist within their local community. The hope is that later they can be able to tackle global issues using the skills they learned locally. GMC collaborates with the Poultney Historical Society in many ways. Staff assist in the planning and organizing of the annual history day, East Poultney Day, which takes place every August. The purpose of this event is to highlight the town’s local history and its local economy. Staff assist in the coordination and preparation of the “Poultney Historical Society Lecture Series”. The goal of these programs is to provide Poultney residents, GMC faculty, staff, and students with the opportunity to attend history education and recreation programs, locally. Individual student research projects also aid the Historical Society, such as the published paper on “Pre-Historic Poultney (8,500 BC- 1761 AD)” by Jacob Musial ’10. Students also engage in internship programs and community service opportunities with the Society.  

For the Annual Poultney Earth Fair, which happens every spring at the local high school, many GMC students and several faculty and staff support the initiative through labor and materials. They host several demonstration booths or exhibits and help organize the event. The Earth Fair attracts hundreds of people from the local area and is organized with the purpose of promoting environmental awareness and education, with particular focus on children. This past April 24th (2014), when the Fair was celebrated, approximately 600 people attended the event. There were over sixty activities and demos, live music, and free food. 25% of the Fair was supported directly by GMC.

Assistant Professor Sarah Mittlefehldt had a collaborative partnership with the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest during the development of the Poultney Woodshed Project, a project designed to help the College source its woodchips locally while helping the local economy. 

Assistant Professor Jessica Cuni led her class in a service learning project that collaborated with Stone Valley Arts, a nascent community arts non-profit in Poultney. 

Assistant Professor Chris Brooks, Assistant Professor Jacob Park, Associate Professor Jacob Park, and Associate Professor John Van Hoesen worked on a project on climate change and flood resiliency with the VT Agency of Natural Resources and the Rutland Regional Planning Commission in the spring of 2014. The block course contained four classes attended by a core group of students who engaged in deep service learning through multiple disciplines: environmental law, business, climate change, and communications. 

The College is in a long-term collaboration with the Poultney Mettowee Conservation District, which runs a Native Plant Nusery on Campus. Associate Professor Natalie Coe and others have collaborated with the nursery, which provides native plants for habitat in need of restoration. 

Students in John Van Hoesen’s GIS classes engage in many collaborative projects for a variety of local community partners. In 2013, the new GIS lab in Richardson opened its doors as a spatial resource center, providing collaborative consultation services for local businesses, government organizations, and individuals who have a spatial problem that needs to be solved. 

Many professors, such as Rommey Fuller, Teresa Coker, and Sarah Mittlefehldt have collaborative partnerships with the local elementary and high schools. For example, they built a community garden. 

Assistant Professor Eleanor Tison has had many collaborative relationships with community organizations. As an example, her classes work with the Poultney Community Breakfast Program and RAFFL's Glean Team to build relationships for students by involving them in transformative change in the Poultney community, while assisting people who are food insecure or nutritionally challenged. 
",True,"In the fall of 2012, GMC partnered with the Town Of Poultney and its Downtown Revitalization Committee on a revitalization effort called Poultney 2020. 

Poultney 2020 was a student born initiative that outgrew its origins to later become a transformative, town-wide sustainability partnership effort. Multiple stakeholder groups from the local region and community came together to plan for a community conference held on April 24th, 2013. With over 200 attendees throughout the day, everyone had the chance to vote on major projects that would help advance and support Poultney’s vitality, including economic prosperity, social equity and wellbeing, and ecological health. The projects that received the most votes included: (1) a community center for the arts, (2) a main street park, (3) the promotion and development of the local food system, and (4) the design of a recreational natural trails system. 

During the April 24th conference, four different teams were formed to tackle each of the projects and these teams have continued to meet and plan since then, both separately and as a whole group. Today, there is a Stone Valley Arts Center located in an historic building downtown because of the effort. It is run by a non-profit organization under the same name. For the main street park, the community has voted on the location of where they wish to see the park and now the group is focusing attention on raising funds to purchase the property. They have already made extensive designs for how the park will look. The localvore movement has also taken off with more restaurants adding more local foods onto their menus and most recently with the inception of a new farm-to-table, student run restaurant by LiHigh School. Finally, the trails group has made significant advances in identifying already existing natural trails and cleaning them up. Next steps moving forward including mapping, signage, and promotion. 

To ensure that these projects are ongoing and eventually achieve success, GMC is providing support in terms of logistics, mentorship, research, and financial capital. A faculty member and the outreach coordinator for sustainable community development have taken the lead and dedicated significant time in helping the groups keep momentum by working closely with Town leaders to decide on priorities, coordinate meetings, and find sufficient labor and funding. GMC believes Poultney 2020 is a forward thinking initiative that has involved several classes and internships, and will involve several more, in a way that is transformative to students, staff, faculty, and community members. 
","Partnerships with distant communities have taken many forms. For example, Assistant Professor Robin Currey partners with small-holder farming operations oversees to aid community development and help farmers secure microfinancing. 

On a broader institutional level, GMC is a member of the Eco-League. The Eco League connects Green Mountain College with a consortium of five environmentally themed colleges that are at the forefront of today's dialog about our natural and social communities. Stretching from Anchorage, Alaska, to Bar Harbor, Maine, Eco League colleges represent five distinct bio-regions across the U.S. Student and faculty exchanges enable sustainability skills and knowledge learned in one bio-region to be tested and shared in other bio-regions. Students can spend up to two nonconsecutive semesters of study at any of the five member colleges, or in any of the international exchange programs offered by an Eco League college without transferring schools. The program is set up to allow seamless exchange of students, with students continuing to pay tuition to their home college. The League also serves as a useful venue for more intimate collaborations. For example, Assistant Professor Eleanor Tison is working with Prescott and COA, through the Farm and Food Program, to potentially create a joint course or certificate program in sustainable food systems.

Hilltop’s youth gardening programs started in 1948 with only fourteen children enrolled, but quickly grew in popularity. By 1957, 170 children were participating in Hilltop’s summer gardening programs. By the time Hilltop celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1998, thousands of Bloomington’s children has learned about gardening through Hilltop’s youth gardening programs. 

Today, educational opportunities for children continue, as well as opportunities for students through internships and work study programs. Hilltop offers work-study internship positions with local high school students, as well as IU students. Free seed kits are available to all teachers in and around Monroe County to provide a hands-on teaching activity on plants, biology, and nutrition, and more.

The Hoosier to Hoosier Community Sale 

Hoosier to Hoosier (H2H) is a reuse program that aims 1) to divert reusable items from the landfill during student move-out, 2) to prevent additional resource consumption by selling collected items to students and community members in order 3) to raise funds for local charities and other organizations.

Hoosier to Hoosier is a partnership between the City of Bloomington, Indiana University, and Cutters Soccer Club. In addition, Monroe County Habitat for Humanity has been a valuable partner in past sales.

Cutters Soccer Club partners with area youth organizations, the MCCSC School Age Care Program, churches, and church/charter schools to provide Outreach Soccer—a free program for children who might not otherwise have the opportunity or financial resources to participate in a high quality soccer program.  Cutters also serves special-needs children and adults through TOPSoccer-a program designed to ensure they have the same athletic activities as their able-bodied counterparts. All proceeds Cutter’s volunteers earn from the Hoosier to Hoosier Community Sale will support the Outreach and TOPSoccer programs.

In addition to the three main partners, funds raised through the Hoosier to Hoosier sale go to a number of local other organizations. The volunteer compensation program allows local organizations to apply to receive a portion of proceeds based on the number of volunteer hours their organization provides to sale efforts. At the August 2015 sale, H2H took in over $46,000 and sent 3 semi-trailers worth of donations on to Goodwill, for processing and sale. Over the summer, H2H logged 646 volunteer shifts for 1,815 hours. On sale day, 3,070 shoppers came through the doors, including 700 before 9:30am. The steering committee estimates that 60 tons of reusable items were intercepted from the landfill, bringing the H2H total to an estimated 232 tons since the beginning of this effort in 2010.

While many universities have move-out waste collection and donation programs, this partnership is one of the only ones that sorts and stores items during the summer, for resale in the fall, attempting to close the loop and prevent unnecessary waste before it is purchased. Items are resold at prices far below even Goodwill and other resale shop prices. While the sale advertises the $23 dorm room (two extra-long sheets, one pillow and pillowcase, one blanket, one comforter, one decorative pillow, featherbed, mattress pad, desk lap, throw rug, a storage tote, and wall art, all for a combined total of $23), community members come for the furniture and can find incredibly affordable sofas, coffee tables, lamps, and appliances like microwaves and coffee makers.

Continuing to grow, Hoosier to Hoosier is now part of the City of Bloomington’s “Resale Trail” – a series of reuse and resale events throughout the community, such as “Junk in the Trunk”, an event at which anyone can reserve a parking spot in a local lot and sell items from that station – a sort of pop-up bazaar of reuse and source of small additional income for sellers. It is the hope, and belief, of organizers that the event reduces waste, encourages thinking about waste and consumption in new ways, encourages a reuse economy, and provides funding for community groups and non-profits.

2. Energy Efficiency with Innovate Indiana/Partnership with NSA Crane
A pilot project designed by Indiana University graduate students to lower energy use at three Naval Support Activity Crane facilities saw reductions that ranged from 4.5 percent to nearly 26 percent over a three-week period earlier this fall.
Results of each study, conducted by students from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, were presented to NSA Crane officials. The project was the first launched through an educational partnership agreement signed in October by IU and NSA Crane.
Three teams of students supervised by William Brown, IU's director of sustainability, spent early October obtaining baseline data for energy use at a 31,233-square-foot administrative support facility built in 1944, a 68,000-square-foot structure built in 2006 that holds 202 Army and Navy personnel, and the Navy Gateway Inn and Suites, a 28,300-square-foot building constructed in 1999.
The teams applied behavioral science tools -- such as commitment, social norms and prompts -- focused on energy reduction, and then measured energy use at each building from Oct. 19 through Nov. 5.
The Army/Navy building saw a 4.5 percent reduction in energy use, while the administrative support building saw a 20.4 percent drop in consumption. The hotel realized a 25.8 percent reduction in energy use, even though days during the pilot study were cooler than during the baseline measurements.
In terms of costs, the reduced energy use at the Army/Navy facility equates to a potential savings of more than $6,000 annually. Estimated savings of $660 at the administrative support building during the pilot period extrapolates to roughly $11,440 a year, while savings of $40 per day at the hotel amounts to about $14,600 annually. 
""I think the cumulative results of this project support our objective going in, which was to show that applying behavioral science to influence energy conservation is cost-effective and scalable,"" Brown said. ""Because the pilot period was short, other factors may have contributed as well -- or the approaches we used might have proven more effective over time. A longer study could determine that more definitively, but the key still lies in getting people to change how they think about energy consumption.""
NSA Crane's commanding officer, Cmdr. Tim Craddock, said the students gained valuable experience with interacting in a large workforce where some members may prove apathetic when it comes to energy conservation.

""What we saw emerge from this study is the kind of outcome we anticipated when IU entered the Educational Partnership Agreement with NSA Crane,"" said Kirk White, IU assistant vice president and military liaison. ""We saw talented students step up and put skill sets to use that NSA Crane might not otherwise have access to. At the same time, these students gained applied experience that will boost their job prospects upon graduation.""

CURes has ongoing partnerships and projects with many organizations dedicated to environmental protection and to education; partners include Friends of Ballona Wetlands (5yrs), The Bay Foundation (5yrs), Annenberg Foundation (1yr), the USDA Forest Service (2yrs), The Council for Watershed Health and others. Various programs that engage the local community include the Teacher Academy, in which teachers from schools in local underserved communities learn how to implement our urban ecology curriculum into their classrooms. Another example is the docent program, in which trained students and community members volunteer to give informational walks through the Ballona Discovery Park. The community science program was developed and implemented with support from the office of LA County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. The goal of this program is to empower participants to engage their communities in urban ecology and green technology by providing scientific monitoring tools to help community members of all ages gather critical environmental data that will both bolster their stewardship and better the ecosystem and social health of their communities through the development of urban gardens, and environmental remediation programs. 40% OF CURes staff time, and resources are used to develop and support sustainability programs for the local community. We pride ourselves on program development that meets the unique needs of each community and this can only be done with their direct involvement.",True,"The Center for Urban Resilience works to support social equity, well being and ecological health by reaching out to Title 1 schools throughout local Los Angeles neighborhoods. There are two major ways in which CURes works to introduce sustainability to these communities. The STEM curriculum, Urban EcoLab (cures.lmu.edu) emphasizes locally-relevant field studies and is focused on engaging students in scientific study through the “four ways of knowing science”:  understanding science, talking science, doing science, and acting on science. CURes leads multiple programs in education including pioneering urban ecology curricula at the high school and middle school levels. For the past 5 years they have offered services for both formal and informal science providers. By developing strategic partnerships with the Friends of Ballona Wetlands, Youth Science Center, Heal the Bay, The Bay Foundation and the Council for Watershed Health, we reach beyond the borders of Los Angeles County serving a broad scope of communities throughout Southern California. Specifically, CURes curricula and professional development services emphasize urban science and policy as interactive and participatory subjects. This approach treats the ever-changing city landscape as a distinct ecosystem. By applying urban ecology principles, instructors gain practical knowledge and tools of environmental assessment.  The science lessons and accompanying field-study activities are adaptable for K-12th grade students. CURes’ Urban EcoLab curriculum consists of 133 lessons, multi-media resources, informational texts, and accompanying student assessments available free of charge to all educators. We offer free professional development workshops to teachers for our Urban EcoLab High School curriculum. CURes serves over a dozen schools of high need throughout Southern California. Our community of science and curriculum program includes LAUSD, Culver City Unified, Wiseburn Unified, Bassett Unified and neighboring charter and Catholic schools. 
Restorative Justice is an innovative alternative to the punitive system, whereby people are held accountable for their behavior at the community level that is run by CURes at LMU. The RJ process allows everyone involved in a crime or conflict to work collectively toward community-based solutions. Such community-based solutions present the potential to addresses root causes of oppositional or deviant behavior. RJ serves as a more meaningful way to handle offenses; it attempts to redefine crime as an injury to people and their relationships and turns the emphasis towards repairing those relationships. Restorative Practices (RP) is a philosophy that grew from RJ that aims to provide school communities with safe, inclusive, and effective tools to help develop relationships within a healthy school environment. This comprehensive strategy can be used to help mold knowledgeable, responsible, and civically engaged citizens. In our approach to RP, we take a whole-school perspective, whereby we invite all stakeholders—students, faculty, administrators, etc.—to participate in the restorative process. This strategy promotes an environment where the school community benefits from collaboratively working toward building strong interpersonal and community relationships.

Founded in 2005, the Center partners with public, private, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations to identify and enhance the key drivers of innovation in regions across Indiana, the U.S. and beyond. These drivers include a vibrant and inclusive civic leadership, a commitment to collaboration, the application of advanced data support systems to promote sound decision-making and the pursuit of economic development investments that build on the competitive assets of regions. As such, the five goals of the PCRD align with major contributors to healthy and sustainable regions. 
The five goals of PCRD:
1.	Strengthen the Civic Leadership of Regions - Recognizing the economic needs and assets of regions rests, in part, on access to high quality data tools that can produce a comprehensive assessment of the region’s social economic, educational and environmental resources.
2.	Strengthen Collaborative Leadership - Vibrant regions depend on a diversity of people and groups contributing to the civic life of their regions. In addition, they hinge on the presence of a pipeline of new leaders who are capable of working in partnership with existing leaders to think and act regionally.
3.	Promote Regional Strategy and Planning - Embracing a framework that promotes sound planning and timely decision making is critical to the effective tackling of regional concerns and opportunities.
4.	Advance Economic Development and Business Growth Strategies - Strong and sustainable economies require the pursuit of an appropriate mix of economic development strategies, especially ones that reduce economic gaps and strengthen a region’s economic assets.
5.	Tap the Talents of Purdue Faculty and Staff - No matter the complexity of the challenges regions face, PCRD has access to a team of highly talented Purdue University faculty and staff who can provide guidance on key regional matters.

To fulfill its mission and meet its goals, PCRD has developed the following signature programs:
o	The Regional Decision Maker (RDM) and Demographic Profiles programs look to visualize critical data that informs local leaders and organizations of their region’s unique characteristics.
o	The Great Lakes Training Initiative is about building trusting relationships among key players that spur the movement of ideas into action in an agile manner. The initiative represents an effort by six University-based Centers in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. 
o	Stronger Economies Together, Strategic Doing, and the EDA University Center aim to promote the development of a high quality multi-year plan that builds on the economic strengths of the region
o	Economic Gardening and the Small Business Development Center (ISBDC) were established to advance a suite of programs that foster a balanced investment in the economic development activities of a region.

Specifically, every year, members of Rice’s Environmental Club are invited to attend Earth Day at Emerson Elementary School in Houston.  They present 2-3 activities that engage students in environmental thinking.  In past years, students have built bird feeders, made recycled paper, tie dyed earth day t-shirts, participated in environmental facts scavenger hunts, and listened to Rice students discuss environmental career options. ",True,"(1) The Community Bridges Program:

Rice University sponsors Community Bridges, a service-learning and collaborative program that aims to strengthen the relationship between Rice University and the Fifth Ward of Houston.  The Fifth Ward is home to over 26,000 people. In 2011, the median annual household income for a Fifth ward resident was just $14,198, and the dropout rate of incoming high school freshman was nearly 40%. (In the very same year, a high school in the neighboring area, Lamar High School, was ranked as one of the top high schools in the United States.)  Community Bridges was founded in 2011 by the Kinder Institute for Urban Research and the Center for Civic Engagement, in partnership with the Office of the Dean of Undergraduates.  Community Bridges allows Rice students to work at a variety of non-profit organizations including The Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Center (CRC) and The Fifth ward Enrichment Program. The Fifth Ward CRC is a catalytic organization dedicated to the collaborative fostering of holistic community development which seeks to sustain and build the Fifth Ward as a beautiful and better place to live, work, and play. The Fifth ward Enrichment Program is a youth leadership and development program for at-risk males which aims to engage high-risk minority youth in a positive and educational after-school environment.

Through these organizations, students are able to learn about urban issues through 1) an in-depth seminar-style academic course, and 2) a semester-long internship experience.  Community Bridges aims to strengthen the relationship between Rice University and the Fifth Ward by supporting students who seek to develop and implement long-term projects focused on the sustainable reduction of poverty.  The specific program aims of Community Bridges are:

Program aims
•	To sustainably reduce poverty in the Fifth Ward.
•	To offer an experiential-learning program at Rice University that fosters lasting relationships between the undergraduate community and the Fifth Ward.
•	To generate a meaningful impact for both the Fifth Ward community and Rice University students.
•	To expand structures for the Rice and Fifth Ward community to work together and develop projects that will effectively address the needs of the Fifth Ward as seen by residents of the Fifth Ward.
•	To encourage discussion in the Rice community on issues related to social inequality, poverty and socioeconomic mobility in Houston

Students can choose to participate in one of these non-profit organizations by registering for a one-semester internship through Community Bridges that allows them the opportunity to explore a community outside of the Rice campus, meet new people, engage in challenging and meaningful work, and attempt to rectify complex urban challenges that face people in the Fifth Ward every day. In past years, students who spent a semester working at Fifth Ward non-profit organizations completed projects ranging from installing public art projects in the Fifth ward and planning NBA sponsored redevelopment days, to organizing curriculum for an after-school program and assisting in asset development and financial training for residents of the Fifth ward who earn less than $15,000 per year.

Students can earn 1 credit hour as a Community Bridges Fellow through SOCI 469: Community Bridges Training, and 4 credit hours through SOCI 470: Urban Inequality.  Students are expected to work 5-7 hours per week on-site in the Fifth Ward as part of their fellowship.  Applications to become a Community Bridges Fellow are due every fall, and are submitted via the Kinder Institute for Urban Research.  

2) The Janus Award:

The Janus Award promotes student investigation of complex environmental or science issues from multiple perspectives. The award is open to all non-graduating Rice undergraduate students and supports summer research with a stipend of $2,500. Although the Janus Award is available for projects anywhere within the United States, applications for Houston-focused projects are especially encouraged, and often, the proposed projects involve a community partner within the greater Houston area. Additionally, a number of Janus Award recipients have conducted research related to one or more aspects of sustainability. For example, in recent years Janus Awards have fostered partnerships with the Texas Medical Center, working to install a solar panel system on parking garages. As another example, a Janus Award recipient investigated the relationship of Houston's economic growth as a global oil and gas center to the city's declining air quality.  The Janus Award is administered by the Center for Civic Leadership’s Office of Fellowships and Undergraduate Research.  Janus Award applicants must include a letter of support from a faculty member willing to serve as a project advisor over the duration of the summer research project, and are strongly encouraged to have identified a counterpart advisor at a non-Rice partner institution when applicable.  Rice University’s sustainability officer has served as a project advisor for multiple Janus Award recipients. 
",True,"(1) The Houston Action Research Teams:
The Houston Action Research Team (HART) program serves as a bridge between Rice University and the City of Houston.  “HARTs” are small, interdisciplinary teams of Rice undergraduate students who work together with local community offices and organizations to address issues and challenges facing Houston and its citizens. 

•	HARTs are developed through collaboration between Rice University’s Center for Civic Leadership and Houston community partners.
•	HARTs match Houston community partners with skilled and motivated Rice student teams from a range of academic fields who can help address complex civic questions and community challenges.
•	HARTs give undergraduate Rice students opportunities to apply what they learn in the classroom to real-world issues.
•	HARTs allow Rice students to learn from their teammates and from community partners.  
•	HARTs enable Rice students to develop team- and community-based leadership skills. 
•	HARTs provide students with skills and opportunities to communicate their ideas effectively to various stakeholders.
•	HARTs develop creative responses to issues and questions identified by Houston community partners.

HART project teams are formed annually with a duration that can sometimes last multiple semesters.  Since the program began, a number of HART projects have been related to one or more aspects of sustainability.  For example, a HART team consisting of four undergraduates worked with Houston’s metropolitan transit agency (METRO) and identified specific service, outreach, and design changes to help METRO improve bike-bus transit in the City of Houston.  Their findings were presented to METRO staff and were featured in the Houston Chronicle in September 2013.  Similarly, another 4-student HART team worked with the Southeast Houston Transformation Alliance (SEHTA) to assist in the development of a more accessible network of pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit options for community residents.  Another 4-student HART team created a plan for revitalizing the Eldorado Ballroom, an historic African-American music venue in Houston’s Third Ward, with a vision that the facility serve not just as a venue for public events but also as an incubator for community-based entrepreneurship.  

 The HART program is overseen by Dr. Elizabeth Vann of the Center for Civic Leadership.  


(2) The Houston Sustainability Indicators program:
The Houston Sustainability Indicators program (HSI) was developed by Rice’s Shell Center for Sustainability to assist with the characterization of sustainable development in Houston. The need for sustainable development indicators was first identified in 2004, when the Shell Center held the Houston Sustainability Scenarios Project, which brought together 70 individuals representing Houston’s government, NGO’s, business, and academic community to build scenarios for Houston. Thus, from the beginning, the initiative was intended to involve collaboration between the entire city of Houston in order to catalyze community resiliency and regional sustainability. The aim of the program was to identify needed research to define a sustainable development baseline and to measure the progress of the city. In 2009, the Shell Center for Sustainability issued a call for proposals to develop a plan that identified sustainable indicators for the Houston region. In 2010, the project was introduced in a Rice university undergraduate course, Sustainable Design, where the students compiled a report with 25 proposed measures focused on sustainable development through the economic, environmental and social lens. 24 proposed indicators were chosen, ranging from population growth and unemployment rate to median household income and air quality, and data was then collected for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. This allowed projections to be calculated for the years 2015, 2020, 2030, and 2040. 
The Houston Sustainability Indicators metrics and publications have been published at http://houstoncommunitysustainability.org/  Annual reports of indicators from the years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 are included in the publications section of the web site, as well as a list of extensive local media coverage.  Furthermore, the web site includes maps of indicators displayed at the levels of city-wide, council districts, and super-neighborhoods.  

The program is expected to continue to spur discussion in Houston about policies and programs to assist in enhancing sustainable development within the city.

The Houston Sustainability Indicators program is operated by Dr. Lester King of the Shell Center for Sustainability, with consultation from dozens of university and local experts, and with guidance from the Shell Center for Sustainability’s Operating Committee.  This governance allows for input and engagement from multiple stakeholders.  Further, stakeholders are provided with the opportunity to provide feedback during public workshops in which indicators and results are presented and discussed.  
","The Rice University Student Chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) is a student-run organization that partners with communities in developing countries to design and implement sustainable and culturally appropriate engineering solutions to meet their basic needs. The faculty sponsor for the club is Dr. Pedro Alvarez, Chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  Other Rice faculty, staff, alumni, and community partners periodically provide training and mentorship for the student project teams. 

Since 2004, the Rice University Student Chapter of EWB has completed 12 projects in locations such as El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Mexico.  Three projects are currently underway in El Salvador and Nicaragua, which are expected to benefit an estimated 2,500 people.  These projects include:
•	a 6.8 km gravity-fed water distribution system to deliver potable water from a mountain spring to the communities of Los Alas, El Caulote, La Loma, and Las Minas in the northern region of El Salvador (duration: 2011-present).  These communities currently suffer from health problems due to a lack of reliable, uncontaminated water. Upon completion, the project will benefit over 1,000 people. 
•	a water distribution system to eliminate the need to cross a highway to access water in the community of Wiscoyol, Nicaragua (duration: 2012-present).  This project includes a partnership with the municipal government and the NGO Fundación Santa Helena.  Completion of this project will improve access to water for over 500 people, and eliminate the sanitation issues of using a manual rope pump and carrying open buckets of water over long distances. 
•	a water distribution system to service the community of Saldrach Zeledon in Matagalpa, Nicaragua (duration: 2014-present) who currently receive water delivered by trucks from a well located adjacent to a trash dump.  The solution will include a one kilometer pipeline and a pump station.  The team is working closely with the National Water Company of Nicaragua (ENACAL) as well as the local government.  Upon completion, the project will serve over 850 people.  

Project teams meet weekly in Rice’s engineering design project laboratory, the Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen, in addition to periodically traveling to the project communities.  

Past collaborative communities include Barrio Lucidia Mantilla, Nicaragua (2012-2014, water system); Pueblo Nuevo, Nicaragua (2006-2010, health clinic); El Pital, El Salvador (2006-2010, water system); El Panama, Nicaragua (2005-2011, pedestrian bridge); Bernandino Diaz Ochoa, Nicaragua (2005-2007, health clinic); Piedritas, Mexico (2004-2008, water system); and La Ceiba, El Salvador (2004-2006, water system).  Throughout these projects, students form strong intercultural relationships, and become socially and environmentally conscious engineers with outstanding leadership skills and practical, hands-on experience.

The Rice University Student Chapter of Engineers Without Borders receives sponsorship from the Rice Global Engineering and Construction Forum, the Albert and Ethel Herzstein Charitable Foundation, GSI Environmental, the West University Rotary Foundation, the Rice Engineering Alumni Association, Chevron, Shell, and the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists.

With a shared goal to expand the urban forest, Canopy has provided countless Stanford students, staff, and alumni with the volunteering opportunity to plant trees and improve our local environment through its Healthy Trees, Healthy Kids! Program, among many others.

Community Environmental Action Partnership:
The City of Palo Alto and community groups created the Community Environmental Action Partnership (CEAP) in 2008 in accordance with the recommendations made by the City’s Green Ribbon Task Force and the Climate Protection Plan. CEAP's mission is to bring the various segments of the community together to share knowledge, build mutual understanding, leverage resources, and both create and implement innovative environmental solutions. CEAP goals include: identify and implement top-priority environmental initiatives with measurable objectives; educate and engage each segment of the community in environmental initiatives that fit their needs; create a vehicle for communication, education and awareness among the City and all segments of the community; leverage resources and actions among segments by aligning and coordinating efforts; connect with expertise, input and initiatives from the community and beyond to inform, improve and inspire innovative ideas and programs; and track and report progress toward objectives to the community.

The community is divided into eight segments and a “liaison” is appointed to each segment.  The liaisons, which serve as an Executive Committee, meet monthly to share the accomplishments of the work done by the segments. Stanford is one of the segments and a liaison provides a conduit between the environmental and sustainability efforts of the university and the other CEAP segments.


",True,"Sustainable Cities:
Sustainable Cities is a service-learning course offered through Stanford University’s Program on Urban Studies. Students learn and work collaboratively with Bay Area government agencies and community organizations to support their sustainability goals. Experiential learning outside the classroom allows students to serve the local community in achieving a more sustainable future. Sustainable Cities presents students with the opportunity to work hands-on in a professional environment with the close guidance of professional staff and Stanford faculty. Students select projects that fit their personal interests and skill-sets and are matched with other students into project teams. The teams work diligently on the projects over ten weeks, and present their final products to key stakeholders and community members at the conclusion of the class. Some of these projects, such as the Downtown Redwood City Bike Parking Inventory 2010 and the Redwood City Bike Share Assessment have been, or are in the process of being implemented. Past partners include Redwood City 2020, Joint Venture Silicon Valley, How Youth Perceive the Environment (HOPE), and more.

Stanford GOALS Partnership:
Stanford GOALS is a multi-year Stanford Prevention Research Center program to evaluate an innovative, community-based approach to addressing childhood obesity. Stanford’s partners, the Boys and Girls clubs of the Peninsula, Redwood City Police Activities League and Redwood City Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department, identify youth at risk for obesity and engage them in developing healthy lifestyles. Children enrolled in GOALS participate in a health education program or an active intervention, which includes a team sports program, home visits to reduce screen time and improve the home food environment, and primary care provider follow-up. The partnership builds upon existing after school programming and also partners with Stanford Athletics to provide site visits from the Stanford student-athletes, visits to campus for mentoring programs, and on-campus field days. The GOALS partnership seeks to develop best practices to serve community youth and exemplifies the positive, communal nature of a partnership based on social change.

Redwood Environmental Academy of Leadership (REAL)
REAL grew out of a Stanford K-12 Initiative grant called ""Ecology: Learning by Doing and Making a Difference."" It has grown into a Sequoia Union High School District academy program for environmental science education and stewardship. REAL uses Cordilleras Creek, which runs through the campus of Redwood High School, to engage students in hands-on ecology-based learning, creek restoration and research.

Science in Service:
Science in Service (SIS) is a unique collaboration of Stanford students, science and engineering faculty, service-learning educators, and Peninsula community organizations. The program connects Stanford students to youth in neighboring communities through science mentorship and after-school science programs, providing Stanford students a unique opportunity to learn about and participate in science outreach. SIS brings science content enrichment to children who may not have access to positive and fun science experiences. Participating children benefit both from this academic enrichment and from the mentorship of a college student role model. Stanford participants receive training in key techniques for teaching science through mentorship. Trained students then serve as science mentors to children in after-school programs at the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula (BGCP) and Citizen Schools in East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City, with ongoing support from SIS staff. There are opportunities for Stanford students who are new to science outreach as well as students who have previous teaching experience.
",True,"Searsville Dam and Reservoir Study: 
Searsville Dam and Reservoir was built in 1892 by the for-profit Spring Valley Water Company and acquired by Stanford in 1919. The dam, which is structurally sound, provides a source of non-potable water used on campus for landscape irrigation. A faculty and staff committee that includes Stanford scholars who specialize in engineering, environmental science, history and law is studying alternatives for the future of Searsville Dam.

Because of the extent and rate of sedimentation that will lead to the eventual loss of the reservoir and the importance of all of the various hydrologic and natural habitat issues involved, Stanford is conducting an in-depth, expert comprehensive review of all issues and all possible actions related to the dam's future. Stanford believes that only a careful, thoughtful analysis of the complex, intersecting issues will provide a proper road map for the future of this important biological preserve and the species that thrive there.

Steering Committee:
The committee is co-chaired by Jean McCown, Stanford director of community relations, and Chris Field, faculty director of Jasper Ridge and professor of biology and of Environmental Earth system science. The Committee includes prominent faculty: Jeffrey Koseff, co-director of the Woods Institute for the Environment; Pamela Matson, dean of the School of Earth Sciences; Buzz Thompson Jr., professor of natural resources law and co-director of the Woods Institute for the Environment; David Freyberg, professor of civil engineering and hydrology; and Richard White, professor of history. Staff members include senior leadership and specialists in conservation, land use, environmental sustainability and water conservation.

Advisory Group
In 2013 Stanford established an advisory committee of external representatives to provide input to the steering committee's evaluation process. Examples of members of this group include representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, California State Water Resources Control Board and the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority along with more local representation from local governments and non-profits such as Acterra, the Committee for Green Foothills, CalTrout, Santa Clara Audubon, American Rivers and Beyond Searsville Dam, as well as individual community members and neighbors. 

The Advisory Group provides input and feedback to the Steering Committee on each phase of the process, including considerations of alternatives. 

In relation to broader water conservation and flooding control efforts within the local communities surrounding Stanford, the university works closely with the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (JPA). The JPA is developing a regional comprehensive plan for both the waters that flow into San Francisquito Creek and onto San Francisco Bay (its watershed) and the waters that threaten our communities from the Creek and from Bay tides (our floodplains).  Within the context of this plan, the JPA is leading the local effort on four major projects.  Working their way upstream from the Bay, they are planning, designing, and soon constructing capital projects to eliminate risk to over 8,400 properties and the need for many of them to pay premiums to the National Flood Insurance Program.  Integral to this effort is our work with Caltrans on their project to replace the Highway 101 crossing over the Creek.  And while we are designing and implementing local projects without waiting for a federal government solution, we continue to keep open the possibility of federal support through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 

Another major project includes working with the one of the JPA’s member agencies, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, to analyze what capital improvements are necessary to provide 100-year flood protection for the flood prone reach of San Francisquito Creek upstream of U.S. Highway 101. Creek capacity improvements being analyzed include bridge replacement, channel widening and naturalization, floodwall construction or enhancement, a bypass culvert, and upstream detention facility.  It is likely that a suite of these alternatives will be required to address the flooding problem.

The center also explores ways to re-establish adult relationships with the youth and to research and test the best ways to implement treatment.

For almost a decade, the Star House philosophy provides services to youth with no strings attached – services such as food, showers, new or gently used clothing, washing machines and dryers to clean their clothes, as well as computers and telephones. Community-based services such as therapy, medical care, HIV/AIDS testing and help securing identification and employment are also available to youth. Star House brings in nearly 20 outside community partners to engage youth with needed services.

The work at the Star House is making a difference in multiple ways including sustainability by providing opportunities for homeless youth to increase their financial standing as well as their social wellbeing. 
",True,"The Ohio State University, in cooperation with The City of Columbus, created Campus Partners for Community Urban Redevelopment in 1995 to spearhead the revitalization of the University District.  Their mission is to revitalize distressed neighborhoods within the University District of Columbus, Ohio and improve the quality of life for students, faculty, staff, residents and business owners throughout the university community and thereby, reinforce the stature of The Ohio State University as one of the world’s great public research and teaching universities.

The hallmark of Campus Partners’ work has been a market-based strategy which relies on community planning, a comprehensive approach to neighborhood renewal, partnerships among the major stakeholders and strategic projects that leverage private investment and change underlying conditions in the neighborhoods.  Those who live and work in the University District have many opportunities to participate in civic life and to contribute to and improve their neighborhoods. To facilitate revitalization of the University District neighborhoods, Campus Partners' relies on Planning, Projects and Partnerships to create positive change in the community.

Tufts Engineers Without Borders (EWB) is a student group at Tufts University that designs and implements sustainable engineering projects in developing communities. EWB at Tufts is unique in that it includes liberal arts and engineering students who work together to integrate the conceptual and technical strengths of both schools and thereby strengthen our chapter's projects in the communities in which we work.

Tufts EWB works with professional and faculty mentors to design technologically sound projects in communities who express their desire to partner with us. To ensure the sustainability of our projects, we build robust relationships with our partner communities and use participatory methods to address their most pressing needs. Throughout the lifespan of our projects, the communities are highly involved in the assessing, designing, implementing, and monitoring phases.

Tufts EWB is working on projects in Mbale, Uganda and Porvenir, El Salvador that focus on clean water access. Each team travels at least once a year, performing assessments, monitoring, and implementing new designs. Throughout the year our teams meet to design structurally sound water solutions, communicate with non-government organizations in participating countries and community members, and communicate and collaborate with other EWB groups across the nation and groups with similar interest at Tufts. Group members gain experience writing and applying for grants as well as working with other students to apply what they have learned in the classrooms at Tufts to designs that can drastically impact the lives of individuals who need it the most.

Stakeholder groups include partners that have worked with the university for many years. New partnerships develop through word of mouth, as a result of Tulane member or student referral or contacts agencies out of shared interests and missions. Each partner completes a formal process including an orientation, signing an agreement, a site visit, and establishing an on-line profile. Tulane partnerships institutionalize systematic change in that they engage all undergraduates, hundreds of graduate students and a growing number of faculty and staff, which has led to a culture shift at Tulane and in the community. 







































",True,"Developed out of a partnership with Tulane, Grow Dat Youth Farm’s mission is to nurture a diverse group of young leaders through the meaningful work of growing food. Grow Dat works collaboratively to produce healthy food for local residents and to inspire youth to create change in their own communities. They do so by training local high school-aged youth in the field of urban agriculture through 13 paid internship positions and opportunities that teach high school students about nutrition and community health. Additionally, Grow Dat’s campus was designed and built with the support of Tulane's School of Architecture using reclaimed shipping containers as structural elements. The campus incorporates recycled products, storm water management, and other best practices that serve as an example of green design for the New Orleans community. In the past academic year, 75 service-learning students from Tulane contributed 375 hours of work to Grow Dat. Tulane supported one Americorps VISTA volunteer who worked there full time for one year before becoming a full-time employee. Tulane’s multifaceted involvement at Grow Dat demonstrates the university’s commitment to the organization. As the collaborative partnership continues to grow, Grow Dat informs professors about their needs and finding ways to align the organizations needs with those of university members. For example, Grow Dat has worked with students in business service-learning courses to implement team-building service activities. Grow Dat has demonstrated the ability to sustain collaboration over time by consistently getting involved in different programs at Tulane including workshops, trainings, meeting with professors, speaking to students in classes, or giving presentations to student organizations. Grow Dat does an amazing job of recognizing opportunities and being flexible enough to take advantage of them. This continued effort to, not only, sustain, but to expand, their collaborations with Tulane is what makes Grow Dat such a successful partner and powerful force in New Orleans. Furthermore, Grow Dat is always willing to offer and give feedback to professors, students, and administrators, which is crucial in a collaborative partnership. This feedback enables us to evaluate, adapt, and expand our impact. Grow Dat serves on the Tulane Center for Public Service’s Community Advisory Board.
",True,"A number of CPS partnerships are transformational in that they support economic prosperity, social equity and well-being, and ecological health through mutually beneficial experiential education. Since 2006, Tulane has developed transformative partnerships with 58 organizations with support of the Corporation for National and Community Service. The infrastructure and capacity created by Tulane's VISTA program allows organizations and communities to utilize the services provided by the general public, youth, high school, college students, and  university professionals more effectively and creatively. VISTA members serve as liaisons between Tulane and the partner agencies, helping to create job descriptions, prepare training sessions and orientations, organize public service students in activities designed to reduce poverty, enhance civic engagement, and encourage economic sustainability. Community partners work with CPS to host an AmeriCorps VISTA member for 2-3 years in an effort to build that organization's capacity. The VISTA members also work on additional development projects as specified by the partner organizations and Tulane during their term of service. The program is now taking on a place-based cross-sector approach to addressing complex social problems. Programming to support this initiative has created new jobs, expanded and deepened community based programming including summer camps, and resulted in collaborative proposals for funding. Community Partners are involved in decision making from initial conversations throughout the long term partnerships. Many VISTA partner representatives serve on the Tulane Center for Public Service Community Advisory Board. http://tulane.edu/cps/community/vista/index.cfm

Youth Rebuilding New Orleans, has partnered with Tulane since 2006. Additionally, over 225 Tulane students complete service learning or internships with Youth Rebuilding New Orleans each semester. This partnership has formed into a collaborative enterprise that has become one of Tulane’s most successful community affiliations, as Youth Rebuilding New Orleans continues to be an active participant in Tulane’s other initiative. In January the organization donated an entire week of service hours to Tulane’s Cowen Service challenge to honor President Scott Cowen. Not only is Youth Rebuilding New Orleans crucial to service learning at Tulane, but they also serve an important role in the greater New Orleans community. Youth Rebuilding New Orleans was founded by a Tulane graduate, and is completely organized and run by youth; all of their efforts are directed towards improving the lives of New Orleans’ young people. Youth Rebuilding New Orleans is truly sustainable, as the organization seeks to impact local housing issues by empowering New Orleans youth to better their community. Since its inception, Youth Rebuilding New Orleans has helped over 300 homeowners in the greater New Orleans area and currently employs over sixty teens. In 2010, the organization shifted to renovating homes that have been foreclosed and using youth volunteers to restore them to their original beauty. Additionally, volunteers refurbish homes and sell them to New Orleans teachers at 80 percent of their market value. Through these efforts, Youth Rebuilding New Orleans hopes to use the efforts of students to give back to New Orleans teachers. This unique initiative incorporates student leadership that fuses with a successful non-profit business model and results in sustainable outcomes for all parties involved.  
   



","Every other summer, students have the opportunity to study in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. Ecuador: Tropical Field Biology and Conservation gives students the opportunity to apply the theory and knowledge they have acquired in the classroom to the real world. Students travel with Dr. Karubian and Dr. Duraes to Ecuador for a two-week intensive field course. While taking the course, students experience first-hand the challenges and rewards of conducting field research and implementing conservation activities in tropical environments. These activities take place within a context of community engagement based on active collaboration and interaction with Ecuadorian local residents in a variety of contexts. Students design and implement a ‘hands-on’ research project related to tropical ecology with instructor supervision. This research is conducted at two different sites in Ecuador: one on the western (Amazonian) slope of the Andes and one of the eastern (Pacific) slope. In addition, they visit a number of other natural areas more briefly, to provide students with some perspective on the diverse array of habitats found in the Tropics.
In addition to this engaged research experience, students are exposed to a number of conservation efforts. These include visits to sustainable coffee and cacao production; environmental education initiatives; small-scale agricultural projects designed to improve the nutrition of local residents; and eco-tourism ventures.

An example of the kind of work they do is exemplified by the Spring of 2014 project when the department collaborated with the hamlet of Palenville, town of Catskill and Green County Economic Development to create a plan to develop nature trails, open space and eco-tourism for the area.The students listened to various stakeholders voice their ideas and opinions about what they would like to see happen in their community. Students were broken up into groups and each group was mentored by at least one community member who was able to provide the opportunities and challenges the about the community.  The planning studio completed their first technical memo covered the existing conditions of the community.  A second technical memo discussed the opportunities and challenges. Students met with committee members in the middle of March 2014 to get feedback and finalize details for a public meeting to be held at the end of month. This meeting allowed for further interactions to take place between the planning studio students and community members.  Attendees were encouraged to talk to the students working on the respective topic areas and mark up maps that were displayed with comments, questions, and suggestions. The studio then gave a presentation about why they identified the chosen topics areas and where they were headed with their proposed ideas. Following the public meeting, the planning studio took all the comments, questions and suggestions that were made and applied them to the draft final plan for Palenville which was submitted at the end of April 2014. The document went through several revisions and edit stages based on community feedback and a final plan was rendered at the end of the semester. The final report can be found at: http://www.albany.edu/gp/files/2014_Spring_Palenville_Studio.pdf

This adheres to the criteria of collaborative in that the UAlbany faculty member that is teaching the studio and the students taking the course work closely with the appropriate community partner on a selected sustainability program or project development.  The community partner plays an active role in setting the parameters of the study, providing feedback on the advance of the study and implementation of recommended actions.

",True,"THINK & EAT GREEN @ SCHOOL
http://thinkeatgreen.ca/
Think & Eat Green @ School is a Community-University Research Alliance project promoting change in what K-12 students eat, learn, and do at school in relation to food, health, the environment, and sustainability. The multi-year project (2010-2015) is led by team members from the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at UBC in collaboration with the UBC Faculty of Education, and funded by a $1 million strategic research grant on the environment from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) Community University Research Alliance (CURA) Program. 

UBC’s partners include the Vancouver School Board, Vancouver Coastal Health, the Vancouver Food Policy Council, and numerous non-profit organizations working on food and environmental advocacy. 

This project has seen 400+ UBC undergraduate and graduate students involved in 60 classrooms. A total of 34 elementary and secondary schools received grants to carry out projects in areas of curriculum innovation, food policy and climate change adaptation, and school based food production, consumption, preparation, and procurement. 100 teachers and food advocates participated in the third Think & Eat Green@School Summer Institute in 2013.   

The project brings awareness to the fact that the food system as a whole has a significant impact on greenhouse emissions and our ecological footprint. Through recognizing food as a fundamental element of the organization of society, this project addresses the critical issues of regional food security, food system sustainability, and institutional adaptations to climate change within the context of Vancouver schools. 

The project is transformative in that it enables students, teachers, and policy makers to influence how their food is produced and where it comes from, through concrete school projects in areas of:
•	Food production at school (i.e. food gardens, composting, and environmentally sound and productive disposal of end products);
•	Food consumption, preparation, and procurement at school (i.e. school food programs, cooking skills, and eating spaces, farm‐to‐school programs for fresh local food);
•	Creating and disseminating learning innovations which aim to integrate learning about the whole cycle of food systems, from production, processing, transportation, distribution, consumption, and disposal of end food products (i.e. composting and recycling vs. “waste”) and impacts of health and environment;
•	Researching and developing policy and programs to support more healthy and sustainable food systems at school.

These concrete school projects involve collaborative learning amongst a multitude of players, from university students, researchers, and health and educational institutions to a network of community‐based and community‐supported non‐profit organizations working on food, health, and the environment - linking farms to schools, city dwellers with farmers, school cooks with successful green chefs, restaurateurs, restaurant designers, gardeners, school authorities, teachers and students.

In addition, an arms-length Advisory Board was established that participates in the annual project meetings and provides feedback to the development and unfolding of the project. It is composed of the following experts:
•	Dr. Tara Cullis-Suzuki, President and Co-founder of the David Suzuki Foundation
•	Dr. Charles Ungerleider, Director of Research and Knowledge Mobilization, Canadian Council of Learning, Professor of Sociology, Former Deputy Minister of Education, BC Government
•	Dr. Jean Marcus, Ecologist, Scientist in Residence with the Vancouver School Board, Coordinator of UBC President’s Advisory Committee on Sustainability in the Curriculum
•	Dr. Lee Gass, Emeritus Professor, UBC, 2002 Canada’s Professor of the Year 
•	Dr. Ralph Mathews, Professor of Sociology at UBC and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at McMaster University
•	Steve Golob, UBC Food Services, culinary competition gold winner 
•	Joanne Bays, founding member of BC Healthy Communities, current member of the VFPC and PHABC, is a community food security and sustainable food system consultant working in private practice.

These six agencies collaboratively plan the agenda, choose the topics, and manage the ongoing initiatives.  The goal of the summit is to encourage collaboration and sharing of best practices to help address some of the complex environmental issues in our region.  We do this with the belief that our water shed, food shed and other resources do not follow the same jurisdictional lines that our local agencies do.  In order to create programs that are sustainable, we have to collaborate across these lines.  Conference topics from the year 2013 included green jobs (social/economic well-being), renewable energy (ecological health), buying local (economic prosperity), and collaborative volunteer management. Projects launched during the Conference continue year-round. Examples include the Multi-jurisdictional Renewable Energy Task Force, where we are currently exploring the feasibility of becoming our own utility to allow us to better secure renewable energy for our community through a community choice aggregation option.  We also launched the cross-agency Volunteer Management Program, which enabled local non-profits to shift from a model of recruitment per organization to a collective model of joint recruitment to the environmental movement as a whole.  In each project we take on, we look for opportunities to create deep and lasting changes that will be institutionalized long after the conference.  We do this through policy development and by creating new community resources and lasting community partnerships.  All of the events are open to the public, and the planning committee makes a conscious effort to identify and invite to the event organizations that would be affected or that represent individuals that will be affected by the issues being discussed. We also ask our partners to help us identify organizations outside our existing network.  Information about the summit is posted on our public website, including copies of presentations.  Participants include local government agencies, chambers of commerce, non-profit organizations, campuses, utility companies, and private companies. When new ongoing initiatives are launched through the summit, we give all participants of the broad public event the opportunity to determine if they feel that their organization (or the people their organization represents) would be a stakeholder and, hence, want to be integrally involved in the process, including its governance.  All organizations that declare their interest in becoming an organizer in the ongoing efforts are welcomed to the process.  UCSB contributes year round staff time, as well as approximately $1600 each year for the event. The 2014 conference will prospectively include the pressing topics of water and energy.

Earth Day Houston also features green expos with vendors, a local fare market, live music, a beer garden, food trucks and an eco-artist’s village. Approximately 15,000 people from the surrounding community visit the annual festival, featuring over 100 exhibitors. UH's zones have been continually praised by festival goers as the most engaging and and educating aspect of the festival. 

The University of Houston zone leader tent is coordinated by UH Energy and the UH Office of Sustainability. Supportive efforts by the University of Houston zone leader tent includes a variety of university groups who offer their unique expertise in the sustainability zone. The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science launched a weather balloon to educate the community about atmospheric monitoring. The UH Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) provided hands on solar cell activities and quizzes for kids; including demos on solar-powered toy cars, grasshoppers, fans and light bulbs. CAM also provided informational posters and handouts about their research and outreach activities. The UH Turbine Team displayed components of their partially built turbine to show the mechanics of wind energy. Other university groups include Dining Services, the College of Architecture, the Smart HVAC team, the Air to Aqua team, Enactus, the Energy Association and the Energy and Sustainability Initiative.",True,"The University of Houston Office of Sustainability has a formal, ongoing partnership with the local non-profit organization Urban Harvest. As part of this collaboration, UH provides classroom space to Urban Harvest for their classes. In return, Urban Harvest provides professional advice on organic growing principles in the campus community garden, which has proved invaluable to its success. As part of the partnership, Urban Harvest also works with other university groups like the UH Bonner Leaders, the Gulf Coast Food project, and Health & Human Performance students and faculty.

While the garden is run primarily by two paid student workers in the office of sustainability, campus and community members volunteer in the garden to weed, harvest, plant, fill beds, and compost, strengthening ties between the university and the surrounding community. The garden is financially supported through the Office of Sustainability's budget and fruit, herbs and vegetables are donated to food pantries in Houston's Third Ward. The University of Houston is located within the Third Ward where many residents are low-income and almost the whole ward is considered a food desert. ",True,"In November 2011, University of Houston Research Professor Carroll Parrott Blue received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Our Town Initiative. With this grant, she began developing relationships with both community and University stakeholders to generate a needs assessment originally focused on developing a SMART Park.

Since then, the program's scope has grown to encompass other community projects such as ""Bayou Voices"", the Jack Yates Middle School Photography Program, the Park at Palm Center, and more. It was Blue's intention to identify a team of stakeholders that would eventually takeover her efforts so that the community could continue these efforts of improvement beyond the initial grant's duration, which was realized through the formation of the Southeast Houston Transformation Alliance. 

In order to address the concerns raised from the results from Our Town’s initial work, SEHTA was formed in October 2012 and received its 501(c)(3) non-profit status in March 2013. The Southeast Houston Transformation Alliance (SEHTA) was formally established by stakeholders from Blue's team. SEHTA is a collaborative effort that brings together residents and key stakeholders to transform Southeast Houston area into a healthy, vibrant, and economically stable community.

Three guiding principles emerged from the community’s input and participation in Our Town’s activities, plans, historic research and arts as supported by this grant:

• Personal and environmental health, wellness, and nutrition
• Urban connectivity
• Community empowerment and organization

GO Neighborhood: In January 2013, OST/South Union was designated a GO Neighborhood by Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC). SEHTA serves as the Steering Committee in conjunction with Neighborhood Recovery Community Development Corporation (NRCDC) as the Convening Agency.  GO Neighborhoods is a multi-year comprehensive initiative for revitalizing Houston communities by addressing the many aspects of developing a sustainable community – a good place to work, live, and raise a family. Additional technical assistance came in January 2013 from Blue’s National Park Service’s Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program award.

Most recently SEHTA produced a mobility report for the region, detailing aspects of transportation in the community and its impact on health. For example, the report highlighted the need for better public transportation to get out of ""food deserts"" and the health benefits of walking and biking.

While Blue's involvement in SEHTA is scaling back, the University of Houston continues to support SEHTA with funding and faculty/staff collaboration to continue this truly transformative effort.

The Impact of a Signalized Crosswalk on Crossing Behaviors in a Low-Income Minority Neighborhood 
by Courtney Schultz1, Sonja Wilhelm Stanis1, PhD, Stephen Sayers2, PhD, Ian Thomas, PhD
1Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism, University of Missouri. 2Department of Physical Therapy, University of Missouri. 3PedNet Coalition

Background and Purpose
Communities with predominantly low-income and minority populations are effected by the highest levels of sedentary behavior and obesity (Day, 2006). These underserved communities often have limited access to parks and active transportation resultant of high-speed, high-volume streets and an outdated built environment. While studies suggest that sidewalks, crosswalks, and traffic calming measures can increase pedestrian safety (Pucher & Dijkstra, 2003) few studies have evaluated pedestrian crossing behaviors as a result of infrastructure changes. In 2012-2013, the completion of a signalized crosswalk and landscaped median linking low-income housing with a public park provided a natural experiment to examine the effect of an infrastructure project upon active living behaviors. 

Objectives
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of changes to the built environment to determine whether street crossing infrastructure modifications change pedestrian crossing behaviors or traffic patterns in a low-income and predominately racial/ethnic minority community.

Methods
Data collection occurred at one Intervention site (Providence Road) and one Control site (College Avenue) in Columbia, MO. We selected the Control site by examining relevant characteristics of the neighborhood (e.g., size, income level), and the corresponding street (e.g., number of lanes, typical traffic volumes/speeds, pedestrian crossing facilities). Street crossing behaviors were collected using direct observation and assessed the mode of transportation, legality of the crossing (e.g., at intersections/crosswalks or not), as well as race/ethnicity, gender, and age within 5-6 zones at both sites. Magnetic traffic detectors were also embedded in both the Intervention and Control streets during the data collection to capture traffic volume and speed. Data collection ran concurrently at both sites for seven days (Monday-Sunday) over the same two-week period in June 2012 (pre-intervention) and June 2013 (post-intervention), crossing behaviors were recorded for three hours each day (7:30am, 12:30pm, and 3:30pm) while traffic data were collected continuously for 168 hours during the first week. 

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Independent samples t-tests assessed overall changes in pedestrian crossings and traffic volume at each site from 2012 to 2013. Changes in legal/illegal crossings and traffic speed (above the speed limit/below the speed limit) at each site from 2012 to 2013 were analyzed using Pearson’s Chi Square.

Results
Total pedestrian crossings at the Intervention site (Providence Road) increased from 1,464 in 2012 to 1,658 in 2013 (p<0.001). Between 2012 and 2013, the number of legal crossings at the Intervention site increased from 553 (38%) to 795 (48%) (p<0.001). In both years, the majority of observations were pedestrians (1,099 [75%], 2012; 1,316 [79%], 2013) followed by bicyclists (332 [23%], 2012; 310 [19%], 2013). Amongst children and teens, legal crossings rose from 45(25%) to 94(61%) and from 90(23%) to 169(41%), respectively between 2012 and 2013 (both: p<0.001). In addition, total traffic volume at the Intervention site fell slightly from 148,857 vehicles in 2012 to 148,508 in 2013 (p=0.01). Motor vehicles that were traveling above the speed limit of 35 mph decreased from 67,922(46%) in 2012 to 51,339(35%) in 2013 (p<0.001). 
There was no change in the number of total pedestrian crossings at the Control site (College Avenue) from 2012 (4,385) to 2013 (4,485) (p=0.90). Legal crossings increased at the Control site, but only by 2% (2,341 [53%] in 2012 to 2,507 [55%] in 2013) (p=0.01).  Similar to the Intervention site, pedestrians were most commonly observed (3712 [85%], 2012; 3890 [87%], 2013), followed by bicyclists (640[15%], 2012; 549[12%], 2013). Amongst children, the small number of legal crossings did not significantly change (10 [77%], 2012; 18 [95%], 2013) (p=0.135) but for teens changed from 497(39%) to 162(55%) (p<0.001), respectively between 2012 and 2013. As with the Intervention site, total traffic volume at the Control site fell from 132,428 in 2012 to 124,635 in 2013 (p<0.001). However, motor vehicles that were traveling above the speed limit of 35 mph increased from 64,310 (49%) in 2012 to 73,552 (59%) in 2013 (p<0.001).

Conclusions 
The replacement of an unsafe pedestrian bridge with an at-grade, signalized pedestrian crosswalk and landscaped median significantly impacted both pedestrian crossing behaviors and vehicular traffic behaviors. Specifically, the installation of the pedestrian crosswalk yielded reduced proportions of illegal crossings (especially among children), and reduced the percentage of vehicles speeding on the highway through the neighborhood at the Intervention site while the percentage of vehicles speeding at the Control site increased. This study suggests that street crossing infrastructure changes do change behavior, which will help inform future street crossing interventions and may be used to guide policies promoting physical activity in similar communities where high-speed arterials are barriers to parks and active living.
Implications for Practice and Policy 

By demonstrating increased pedestrian safety and traffic calming, this study adds support to the feasibility of advocacy efforts to reverse transportation practices that favor automobiles at the expense of pedestrian accessibility. These successful outcomes could be used to support advocacy efforts seeking to modify the built environment to increase physical activity in underserved neighborhoods.

",True,"A multi-year integrated Stormwater Master Plan with the City of Columbia, University of Missouri (faculty, staff, students), Boone County, and MODot that identifies and employs BMPs (Best Management Practices) and uses BMPs for public education and research to improve water quality in our urban watershed.  This group meets monthly and discusses ways to fix any storm water issues in the Hinkson Creek watershed. In 2003, the institutions submitted a joint storm water permit application to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources under Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). This plan formalized coordination of storm water management activities. A renewal application was submitted in 2007.

MU has established a variety of policies and plans which include storm water considerations. These include the Campus Master Plan, the Campus Design Principles, Storm Sewer Permissible Discharges Guidance Document, and the University of Missouri Design Guidelines.  

This group is also part of the collaborative adaptive management team.  The goal of the collaborative adaptive management process is to improve water quality in Hinkson Creek by using a science-
based approach guided by a local stakeholder committee. It will assess the entire stream system, including the creek and other parts of the watershed. Improving the ecosystem should help support the return of the biological community to a fully functioning level as well as addressing other pollutants that may be contribution to water quality issues.

The Collaborative Adaptive Management (CAM) approach allows a wide range of actions to be investigated. Each of these actions is expected to contribute to reaching the water quality goals; some of these activities may reduce peak stormwater runoff, others may reduce the pollution in the runoff; under Collaborative Adaptive Management (CAM) both can contribute to the solution by improving the
water quality and supporting the biological community. By learning as we implement actions, we hope to find the most effective
approach(es) to address the water quality challenges in the watershed.","The University participates in the St. Louis Higher Education Sustainability Consortium (STL-HESC).

",True,"The University of Mount Union has a transformative partnership with the City of Alliance Green Commission, and its non-profit arm, Green Alliance.  These groups have developed detailed, transformative Sustainability Plans for both the City and the University which outline the path that the City and University will need to take in order to be ultimately sustainable, providing economic, environmental and social health.  The groups work together to involve stakeholders in the efforts, and to empower spin-off projects and groups for particular elements of the plans, as is appropriate.  All Green Commission meetings are open to the public, and are advertised and reported in the local paper, The Alliance Review.

Mount Union President Richard F. Giese and Alliance, Ohio Mayor Toni Middleton signed a statement of cooperation in 2008 to formalize their work together on sustainability issues.  http://raider.mountunion.edu/sust/Allaince%20MUC%20Sustainability.htm
The two entities share research on sustainable operations;  they support one another in “identifying and securing funding sources for sustainability initiatives including supporting letters, in-kind services, cooperative efforts and possible joint applications;”  each task force is represented on the other task force;  the University provides use of facilities at no cost, for the Mayor’s Green Task Force meetings, as well as use of computers (by Mount Union staff or students) for the city carbon inventory and related research items;  the groups cooperate on education, with the City offering opportunities for student internships, class research projects or other educational activities such as jointly sponsored field trips, seminars, and other educational programs;  as well as public outreach through joint press releases and other public relations activities.

Members of the Mount Union faculty, staff and administration have been serving on Green Alliance: the Mayor's Green Task Force since 2007 and also continue to serve on the City of Alliance Green/Sustainability Commission, institutionalized with an initial Sustainability Plan in November of 2011.  In turn, the community is represented by two community member positions on the University of Mount Union President's Sustainability Task Force (formalized in the fall of 2010 as the University's Sustainability Management Advisory Committee).  The University's eight guiding goals for its Sustainability Advisory Committee include explicitly cooperating with the Alliance Mayor's Green Task Force and other community organizations on matters of mutual interest, and promoting matters of Sustainability to the larger community.  The partnership has resulted in shared research and action on sustainable operations including sustainable land management, energy efficiency and green building, purchasing, fleet management and transportation issues, water and waste management, farmers markets, community gardens , education of both students and the community, and related items, as well as the securing of funding sources for these endeavors.  http://www.greenallianceohio.org/index.html

University faculty and staff serve on the City of Alliance Green Commission and its subcommittees.  This Commission developed the city's Sustainability Plan, and is tasked with reviewing it regularly and advising the City of Alliance in its implementation.   

The University of Mount Union Director of Facilities serves together with the Mayor, and members of the commission on the green energy subcommittee, investigating ways to increase energy efficiency both on campus and in the community, and sharing success stories.  This subcommittee is also actively investigating compressed natural gas filling stations and fleets, electrical charging stations, and methane recapture at the city water treatment facility.  The City has initiated a compressed natural gas filling station pilot program.  The University has installed a large thin-film solar array, in addition to a more traditional solar panel area.   This subcommittee also developed a brochure of green building resources for distribution on the city website, and at their building department.

The transportation subcommittee is working together with the city and county parks departments and city engineering office to develop biking and hiking paths through the city.  They have also been involved with developing the concept of bike racks, designed by local artists, and made of donated recycled materials from a local recycling business.  The Arts in Stark Vision 20/20 group is currently continuing this effort.  The City has successfully pursued grants to implement sections of the Iron Horse bike path, to connect it from north to south through the city, providing a regional bike path connection, as well as a local connector from the University and residential areas to the arts district, farmers market area, and parks beyond.  

Green Alliance, together with representatives from the Mount Union Nature Center, have provided assistance to members of the community to create six community gardens in areas of town which have been identified as a “food desert.”  One of the gardens is located at the High School and helps provide fresh food for the summer lunch program;  another was directly associated with a family shelter.  Others were developed within neighborhoods due to interest within those areas.

From initial meetings of the Mayors Green Task Force, a group of individual community members, including members of the Mount Union faculty and staff, created a non-profit farmers market, which continues to provide an outlet for the area’s smaller farmers, and fresh food for individuals within the food desert area (providing WIC access).  

The City and University Sustainability/Green groups have also worked together to involve and educate the community at various levels.  Mount Union participated in the inaugural Sustainable Alliance Festival held September 24, 2010 through October 3, 2010. Throughout the week, residents from the Alliance area and surrounding communities were invited to attend various events including bike and bus tours, family-friendly games, numerous learning experiences, food, music, and all things sustainable. Mount Union involvement included the showing of the movie WALL-E in the Mount Union Theatre, a tree planting on campus, a lecture entitled, ""Saving the Future: The National Ash Seed Collection,"" as well as Family Nature Games at the Nature Center, a live viewing of ""Dirt! The Movie,"" and a faculty panel regarding how to include sustainability across the curriculum. Additionally, Mount Union President Richard F. Giese joined Alliance Mayor Toni Middleton and a panel of experts as a speaker at the Alliance Leadership Seminar on Sustainability Planning.  An art show and rainbarrel auction involved student artists at the University as well as the local high school, middle school and elementary school.  Mount Union also hosted  the Stark County Green Energy Ohio Solar Tour at their new LEED Silver certified Welcome Center.

In 2011, Mount Union again participated in the Sustainability Festival, September 3 through October 25, 2011.  Among many other events, activities included:  a viewing of ""Carbon Nation,"" ""The Story of Stuff,"" and ""Bag It,"" at the University theater;  a four-session ""Sustainable Living"" educational series was presented by the University of Mount Union Huston Brumbaugh Nature Center; a faculty panel discussion was held on ""Sustainability in the University Classroom"" which was open to the public and covered areas of Sports business, Economics, Religion, and Sociology;  and also a freshman sociology class presented posters on Sustainability to the public.  Mount Union again participated in the Solar Tour. http://www.greenallianceohio.org/pdf/2011_Sust_Alliance_Fest_Sched.pdf

In 2012, Mount Union hosted Green Alliance presentations on a variety of topics  relevant to sustainability:  ""Sustainable Living and Sustainable Food: Aquaponics"";  a panel of experts on hydraulic fracturing - ""Facts and Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing"";  and historic preservation and sustainability - ""The Greenest Building is the One Already Built:  Historic Preservation in Alliance."" 

In the spring of 2013, Environmental Science students at the University of Mount Union gave a presentation to the public on the many factors related to the use of compressed natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel, and how it affects our community and lives.  The University of Mount Union's Huston Brumbaugh Nature center also collaborated on a program with various other agencies in the area to encourage the community to learn more about their parks and outdoor resources.  http://www.greenallianceohio.org/SPRING%20IS%20COMING.pdf
http://www.greenallianceohio.org/index.html

In 2013/2014, members of the University of Mount Union Sustainability Advisory Committee, together with the Green Commission, the Superintendent of the City Schools, and other interested parties, met together to identify major projects to pursue in the coming year.  The artistic bike rack project, the development of hiking and biking maps for use by citizens, and involvement of City School students in envisioning better uses for empty city lots emerged as three priorities for the coming year.  These projects are on-going.

Finally, the Green Commission, with leadership by its Mount Union members, recently recommended that the Mayor sign the Resilient Communities for America Agreement, encouraging the efforts of the Green Commission towards further attention to resilience and adaptation.  

In conclusion, the University of Mount Union has a transformative relationship with the City of Alliance as it seeks to develop itself and its community in a sustainable manner.  The scope of University and City work is broad and transformative as they seek to become a sustainable and resilient community together.  They have been formally working at this goal together since 2008, and have both institutionalized their initial grass-roots efforts so that they will endure.  They have also formalized their commitment to support their efforts together.  They continue to seek out ways to engage their community stakeholders through advertised public presentations and meetings, as well as through invitations to be involved with sustainability projects and celebrations.

• The Environmental Resource Program in the Institute for the Environment enhances public understanding of current environmental science and health research and its relevance to daily life, and empowers North Carolinians to make informed decisions that protect the environment and public health. Workshops involve K-12 teachers, high school students, African-American communities, and local and state government agencies.
• The North Carolina Botanical Garden, an international leader in conservation biology, promotes a sustainable relationship between people and nature through public events and educational opportunities for teachers, students, and the community. 
• The Carolina Center for Public Service promotes opportunities for students and faculty to engage in public service that is responsive to the needs of North Carolina communities. The top five service focus areas for students are children and youth, health, education, social justice, and hunger and homelessness/poverty.
• APPLES, Assisting People in Planning Learning Experiences in Service, a program of the Carolina Center for Public Service, is the oldest student-led service-learning program in the country. It brings students, faculty, and the community together to address poverty, health, education, and environmental issues. ",True,"The UNC Institute for the Environment and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources provide three-day professional development programs for teachers that focus on water, energy, and climate in North Carolina. Teachers explore watersheds and aquatic ecosystems, discover the effects of contaminated water on the environment, and interact with scientists who research water quality monitoring techniques and the health effects of toxic contaminants. ",True,"The Environmental Finance Center (EFC) in the School of Government delivers interactive, applied training programs and technical assistance to address the financial aspects of community environmental protection and service delivery. Trainings focus on water and wastewater infrastructure, energy efficiency, and purchasing. To leverage resources, the EFC often conducts collaborative trainings - partnering with organizations that have environmental but not necessarily financial expertise. In addition to direct community outreach and capacity building, the EFC works with decision makers to assess the effectiveness of environmental finance policies at the regional and state level, and to improve those policies at multiple levels of government.

The Development Finance Initiative (DFI) at the School of Government partners with local governments in North Carolina to attract private investment for transformative projects by providing specialized finance and development expertise. DFI partners with communities on projects including: building reuse, community development, downtown revitalization, economic development, neighborhood redevelopment, and small business finance. This fee-based service extends the capacity of local governments to assess needs, develop new programs, and access relevant financing mechanisms.

Both of these programs catalyze community resiliency and local/regional sustainability by simultaneously supporting social equity and well-being, economic prosperity, and ecological health on a community scale. 
Both of these programs are ongoing and plan for systemic change.
UNC provides faculty/staff and financial or material support. 
Both programs adopt a stakeholder engagement framework through which community members, faculty, and other stakeholders are engaged in program/project development, from agenda setting and planning to decision-making, implementation and review.

Reverend MacDonald Sembereka, a human rights activist for more than 20 years, is the executive director of the faith-based organization Malawi Network of Religious Leaders Living with HIV/AIDS (MANERELA+) and former advisor to Malawi President Joyce Banda.

MANERELA+ works to address issues of poverty, HIV/AIDS, and social justice. By opening dialogues with “gate keepers” such as religious, political and community leaders, MANERELA+’s overall purpose is to reduce stigma, silence, denial, discrimination, inaction and miss-action in Malawi.

Rev. Semebereka returned to the University of South Florida for the fourth time in order to strengthen ties between the PCGS and Malawi. As part of his partnership with PCGS, Rev. Semebereka supervises Patel College M.A. students interning in Malawi. Over the past two years, his organization hosted six students completing their summer internships on sustainable tourism and water projects in the landlocked African country.

“One of my major interests is to ensure we grow a long lasting partnership between PCGS and Malawi,” explained Rev. Sembereka. “Malawi having a growing tourism industry, and the Patel College having a global tourism concentration is critical. We can tap the expertise and learn a lot about water management and development.”

In the realm of stormwater, Albemarle County, the City of Charlottesville, and UVa each have MS-4 permits and are regulating agencies for those permits. The community at-large is part of a pollution diet for the Chesapeake Bay - a total maximum daily load (TMDL) - that applies not only statewide but is the largest TMDL in the Country addressing 7 states. The 3 permitting agencies noted above work in active collaboration to meet our TMDL goals, which cascade in 5 year increments - we are in the first increment and are working together to meet these stringent goals. 
UVa provides faculty/staff and financial support to this effort on an annual basis. ",True,"UVa and its surrounding community have established a transformative partnership through its (1) Planning Commissions (City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County), (2) Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO - 5 County area), and the (3) Master Planning Council (UVa). Senior UVa planning staff are appointed to the City and County (1 each) Planning Commisions to have active knowledge and an active role in shaping each community. The time invested in preparing for and attending Planning Commission meetings is significant, and each community gets the benefit of representation by the University. In exchange, UVa has a Master Planning Council that consists of Vice Presidential UVa staff that addresses planning at and in the context of the University - this is attended by appointed members of the City and County Planning Commissions in addition to the Chief Planning staff for each of those entities. Finally, senior UVa planning staff attend the local MPO Technical and Board meetings and play a role in guiding the large scale planning process for our larger community area and transportation network. This high level coordination within the political network of the community leads to an extraordinary level of coordination in town gown relationships and successful partnerships for the community.

",True,"In June, 2009, The University of Winnipeg introduced a new concept in campus dining called Diversity Food Services Inc. The architects of this food services delivery model are two Winnipeg based organizations, The University of Winnipeg Community Renewal Corporation (UWCRC) and SEED Winnipeg.

SEED Winnipeg, Inc. is a non-profit agency that has been operating in Winnipeg since 1993. Its' mandate it is to combat inner-city poverty by aiding people in their efforts to save money and to start small sustainable ventures. By offering business management training, individual help and business advice, small business loans and savings programs, SEED Winnipeg, working in partnership with like-minded organizations, has been instrumental in changing the course of many lives in the inner-city.

Diversity Foods is governed by a volunteer board that is composed of both representatives from SEED Winnipeg and the UWCRC.

Both SEED and the UWCRC operate with mandates to work within a stakeholder engagement framework.  In particular, a key purpose of the UWCRC is to bring the community to the table with formal input through the Board governance process, throughout the planning and implementation stages of all University development and to create opportunities for joint University/community initiatives. (http://uwinnipeg.ca/uwcrc/)

The mandate of Diversity Food Services is developing nutritious, fairly-priced and ethnically diverse food options. Diversity focuses, wherever possible, on locally sourced foods, organic ingredients, and a commitment to fair-trade practices.

Diversity provides training, mentorship and employment to those in our surrounding community who may face barriers to meaningful work is an approach that is unique among food service providers serving universities in Canada.

This is an ongoing partnership that addresses multiple sustainability issues, including community resilience, support for a local food economy, and advocacy for social enterprise and just food systems in Manitoba.

","The Vassar Haiti Project (http://thehaitiproject.org/)

The Vassar Haiti Project is a non-profit run largely by students, whose mission is to support the welfare of artists in Haiti and the education and nutrition of the school children in the rural village of Chermaitre. They raise funds by auctioning and selling Haitian art and handcraft, which then go to supporting four initiatives: education, medical access, reforestation, and water purification.

Education. Since 2002, VHP has been funding the lunch program and teacher salaries at the primary school in Chermaitre.  The school educates 275 children, from two levels of kindergarten through grade six.  VHP’s first capital initiative was to fund the construction of a seven-room school, which was completed in 2008.  Current concerns include funding the expansion of the school to better serve the needs of students  in the lower grades, as well as creating an academic future for at least some students beyond the sixth grade. 

Health Care. Efforts to improve access to health care began with a temporary medical clinic in 2009.  By late 2011, VHP located a suitable site for a permanent clinic, and construction began.  The clinic provides health care and education to the people not only of Chermaitre but also of several other equally remote villages.  VHP has developed a medical advisory board to help improve access to medicine as well as to provide us with expert advice. 

Reforestation. Perhaps no single initiative in Haiti is more critical to the country’s ability to achieve sustainability as is reforestation.  In late 2010 in Chermaitre, local work teams planted the first seedlings; in just over a year the first 5,000 fruit and lumber trees were in the ground.  Initial plantings include lumber (cedar and numerous varieties of oak) and fruit (apricot, mango, lemon, citron, & coconut).  The first harvests should come by 2015.

Water access and purification. A very exciting effort to improve water access succeeded in early 2011, and through a gravity-driven system of cisterns and PVC piping, water now flows through a faucet by the school.  This was especially welcome in mountainous Chermaitre, where access by schoolchildren to water previously required a half-mile uphill climb.  Research and fundraising efforts began in early 2012 to determine and fund effective water purification solutions, both short and long term.",--,--

The Civic Improvement Action Guide’s Toolkits were created to assist participating residents as they lead their own low-impact community development projects. These offer needed information about navigating regulatory processes and accessing local resources. Many of these are based on tactical urbanism strategies that facilitate citizen-led change on the block, street, and building level.

Most efforts are focused on the establishment of prairies in areas which have been returned to natural landscape after bring developed, and the improvements of the dry run creek, which caused significant flooding in the past.

This partnership has been going for years, and will likely continue, if not indefinitely, until the dry run creek project has been completed. ",True,"Community Builders is an ongoing collaborative experiential learning project, under the auspices of the Leadership Institute and Education Department, in which Wartburg College students work with youth and senior citizens to meet the mutually reciprocal needs of all those involved. The purpose of this project is to use the assets of community members with different backgrounds and skills to build and strengthen the community they share.

All sixth grade students in the local school districts have the opportunity to participate. The college recruits Wartburg students, and community members to lead the groups, which are called neighborhoods. The neighborhoods meet five times a year to learn about the community, and how they can serve. 

Part of the Community Builders program is partnering with community agencies to allow college students to serve alongside community sixth graders. Some service partners are sustainability connected, like the city recycling center, and college garden.

The campus supports this partnership through staff/faculty support, coordination, and participation. The program has been going for awhile (although no record of specifically which year it started could not be found) and will continue for the foreseeable future.

Each trip is led by at least two student leaders, advised by a non-student adult, usually a faculty or staff member. Trips happen locally and distant.

Nearly every trip is connected to sustainability; poverty relief, disaster relief, environmental work, and fighting racism. All trips, local or distant, do a service element together prior to the actual trip, during their team building phase. These service projects are conducted in our immediate community, and usually tie to their full trips mission (i.e. working with the community meal before traveling to help with homelessness in Atlanta, GA). 

In the past few years we have worked with local non-profits like Habitat for Humanity to help alleviate poverty and homelessness in our own community. These efforts work to help the people of our community, the most important part of sustainability, supporting economic prosperity, social equality, and wellbeing.

These trips are supported by the college through a program coordinator, leadership board, partial trip funding, and student leaders. Some departments will even allow staff to earn their regular salary while leading a trip.

These trips, and the Service Trip program, and systemic to establishing Wartburg College as a service driven institution. Service is one of the core pillars at Wartburg, demonstrated in many ways, one of which is service trips.","Break Away Service Trips happen at least twice a year, during the fall break and tour week (between winter and May terms).

The timeframe of the partnerships depends on the partner. We have been partnering with an organization in New Orleans for at least four years, annually sending groups to help with wetland improvements in the Louisiana Delta to help decrease the impacts of hurricanes. For several years we have also worked with an organization along the Mexican border to help alleviate racism towards immigrants. 

During the two years covered by this STARS report (12/13, 13/14) service trips worked towards zero footprint. Throughout the trips, participants completed worksheets, tracking their footprint. Following the trip, each group pooled fund proportionally based on their footprint, to purchase carbon credits.

Guiding Principles
The Guiding Principles of the Southwest Michigan Sustainable Business Forum are to fulfill its mission as stewards in our community. 

The SWMSBF and member organizations will endeavor to:

- Promote sustainability as business practices that encompass the environment, economy and social responsibility.
- Strive to surpass conformance to environmental regulations using compliance as the minimum standard.   
- Follow the waste hierarchy of eliminate, reduce, reuse, recycle, compost, incinerate, and landfill. 
- Develop awareness programs and practices, and implement technologies that safeguard and preserve the environment. 
- Identify the environmental impacts of facilities and materials used in our products, processes and services in order to minimize environmental impact. 
- Encourage environmental organizations, businesses and governmental agencies to cooperate on common issues.  
- Create opportunities to expand the Forum's concept into a national network of sustainable business forums.

WMU is a dues paying member of the organization. Members cross promote events and hold regular gatherings (approximately quarterly) covering an array of sustainability topics. Most recently, the Forum contributed to the success of the 2014 Sustainability Leadership Summit. The Forum also hosts informal, monthly ""Green Drinks"", an organic, self-organizing network, with the intent of creating an ongoing community dialogue about local sustainability issues.

The Southwest Michigan Regional SUSTAINABILITY COVENANT shall be a joint initiative of several organizations in the Southwest Michigan Regional area that are committed to promoting the development of a sustainable infrastructure by the interconnection of economic, social and environmental sustainability principles throughout the region and within their respective community and organizations.

The “Southwest Michigan Regional Sustainability Covenant” provides an opportunity for government, academia and other participating stakeholders to lead the community towards meeting the ”triple bottom line” goal of environmental, economic, and social responsibility that provides an improved quality of life for all future generations – a concept that we define as “Community Sustainability”. The Covenant creates a partnership of stakeholders who are uniquely positioned to have a profound impact on the overall sustainability of this community.

This covenant shall symbolize the joining together of government, academia, healthcare, and other stakeholders for the purpose of working together to ensure that the Southwest Michigan Region continues to be an excellent place to live and that each organization shall commit to the community’s betterment through economic, social and environmental strategies germane to their mission for the benefit of future generations. This shall be accomplished by each participating organization’s acknowledgement and embracement of the concept of community sustainability in its activities. Sustainability includes the careful consideration of life cycle costing and careful consideration is given to environmental and human consequences and continued improvement in the efficient use of energy resources.

As signatories to this Sustainability Covenant, we commit to take the following actions in collaboration with other participating organizations: 
1. Generate a regional and community sustainability vision statement, goals and objectives. 
2. Establish a ‘blue print for sustainability’ to include the identification of sustainability indicators, methods for monitoring progress, reporting successes, and development and sharing of best practices to assure continuous  improvement. 
3. Assessing sustainability in a manner that allows each member organization to develop methodologies, systems, policies and programs that follow the above blueprint. 
4. Share sustainability successes on a regular basis for the mutual benefit of participating organizations and to bring consistency and accountability to sustainability assessment. 
5. Build a sustainability constituency within each member organization and throughout the Southwest Michigan Region through education, community outreach and sharing of best practices. 
 
As signatories to this ‘Southwest Michigan Regional’ Sustainability Covenant, we shall adhere to the purpose and terms of this commitment and pledge our best efforts in developing and promoting Sustainability through our organization and to the Southwest Michigan Region. 

Signatories are available at - http://www.wmich.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/sustain-covenant.pdf

Subsequent activities and explorations in 2010 include Community Sustainability Indicators exploration, a community survey, and stakeholder meetings. See - http://www.wmich.edu/sustainability/reports-publications/office-sustainability-publications

WMU regularly updates partners on institutional sustainability efforts including green building, greenhouse gas emissions inventories, community sustainability indicators research, and climate change awareness and outreach. Office for Sustainability and university leaders have increasingly been called upon to advise community leaders including other local colleges and the Kalamazoo Community Foundation on transformative institutional change. 

We meet regularly with covenant supporters (e.g., Kalamazoo Mayor, Kalamazoo Nature Center, Sustainable Business Forum Leaders) to seek implementation opportunities and support. Recent WMU actions supporting the Covenant and its signatory institutions include our community visioning events exploring ""What does sustainability mean to me?"" at a our Community Roundtable and Sustainability Slam event. WMU also signed on to the Alliance for Resilient Communities (ARC) in 2014.
