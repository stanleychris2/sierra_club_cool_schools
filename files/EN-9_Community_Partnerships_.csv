“Wings of Hope” A partnership between FGCU & Lee and Collier County Public Schools
This program is an integral part of the Environmental Humanities curriculum and service learning at FGCU. University students are introduced to native Southwest Florida wildlife species, their habitats, water conservation and “green” ways a person can help our earth. They then bring this knowledge to young students in 1st - 5th grade with science-based environmental education programs. Elementary school students are bussed to FGCU or programs are presented in their schools - public and private schools in Collier and Lee Counties. 

The following program description was taken from FGCU’s President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll Application (http://myproject.nationalservice.gov/honorroll/VariableContent/PDFApplications/FloridaGulfCoastUniversity_16477_2014.pdf): 
FGCU’s “Wings of Hope” Environmental Education Program is an academic service-learning program embedded in all 12 sections of Environmental Humanities each year. “Building bridges of hope for wildlife, water conservation, and the environment with education and awareness for college and elementary students and their families” is its mission. The course and integrated community-based service program align with multiple tenets of FGCU’s mission: [FGCU] “nurtures community partnerships, values public service, [and] encourages civic responsibility” and “practices and promotes environmental sustainability.” 

This program is an integral part of the Environmental Humanities curriculum. University students are introduced to Southwest Florida wildlife species (Florida Panthers in particular), their habitats, and water conservation. They then bring this knowledge to 4th grade students through environmental education programs. After the programs are completed, all participants continue their mission of environmental awareness by educating family, friends, and the community with their knowledge.

Each year, 500 FGCU students in this course educate over 100 4th grade classrooms in two local counties. The “Wings of Hope” Program Director, 7 Federal Work-Study students, and course faculty prepare FGCU students for their service-learning experiences by providing training sessions. Over 4,000 elementary students come to FGCU and travel through 5 “Panther Posse Program” challenges where FGCU students teach them about panther kittens, radio collars, infrared cameras, wildlife tracks, natural history, and water conservation. The learning process involves hands-on activities, note-taking, and examination of scientific instruments.

These challenges integrate reading, writing, the arts, geography, math, and science. The FGCU students and elementary school students also visit panther habitats when they travel to CREW (Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed). Each FGCU student serves approximately 10 hours during the semester, totaling 5,000 service hours per academic year. The condition in the community that drives our institution to engage in this service is the decline of the Florida Panther: only 80 to 100 panthers remain in Florida, making it one of the most endangered mammals in the world.

This program is related to FGCU’s Institutional Commitment to Service in that the institution provides support for this academic service-learning experience through the hiring of a course coordinator, course faculty, and program director. Faculty integrate the program into their course and provide opportunities for students to reflect on their experience. The reflection assignments connect the science-based service-learning project with the humanities-based curriculum. Additional support has been provided by FGCU for this program in securing a permanent “Wings of Hope” training and teaching facility on campus.

Both the FGCU and elementary school students are assessed at the end of the semester by an “Educating Others” form and survey to evaluate their understanding of the environmental material presented and attitude toward the natural environment as a result of their experience. This data is collected annually to assess the effectiveness of the program and to ensure that both the needs of the community partners and the needs of the university are being met. Because all students are required to educate two additional people in the community, over 12,000 community members are impacted by this environmental education experience annually. The long-term benefit is educated citizens that will positively impact environmental policy based on current research that has found that environmental knowledge is consistently and positively related to environmental attitudes and that environmental knowledge and attitudes are assumed to influence environmental policy. Since 2000, the program has educated 7300 FGCU students and 85,000 elementary students.

""Fighting Hunger - Feeding Hope"" A partnership between FGCU and the Harry Chapin Food Bank

The following program description was taken from FGCU’s President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll Application (http://myproject.nationalservice.gov/honorroll/VariableContent/PDFApplications/FloridaGulfCoastUniversity_16477_2014.pdf): 

Lee County was one of the hardest hit regions in the US by the current housing /mortgage crisis. As a result, food insecurity and emergency food assistance in our area have increased substantially. In response, FGCU has built a strategic community partnership with Harry Chapin Food Bank (HCFB) and has come together as a campus of “informed and engaged citizens” to support this agency and its many partner agencies. The mission of HCFB is to overcome hunger through education and by working in a cooperative effort with over 150 affiliated agencies in the procurement and distribution of food.
One example of this collaborative and concentrated effort was the FGCU Art Department’s Annual Empty Bowls Event, where local potters and FGCU Ceramic students make bowls, restaurants donate soup, and visitors pick a bowl and fill it with soup for a $15.00 donation. After this “soup kitchen” style meal, the bowl is kept as a reminder of all the empty bowls in the community. All proceeds go to Interfaith Caregivers of South Lee (ICSL), a HCFB Partner Agency. The 2012 event raised almost $5,000, and kept ICSL’s food pantry stocked for 6 months. Moreover, FGCU Housing came together to establish an end of semester food collection with 6 Donation Stations for students moving out of the dorms: over 1000 pounds of food was collected. In 2013, FGCU came together to promote and participate in the Annual HCFB Hunger Walk and raised over $26,947, which equates to $161,682 worth of food for our community. FGCU also secured an outside grant with Wells Fargo, through its Foundation, to support a large-scale Make A Difference Day event where FGCU faculty, staff, students, and Wells Fargo employees served at multiple community agencies for a day and HCFB was a partner site. Students also participated in multiple HCFB service projects that were organized by The Office of Service-Learning and Civic Engagement’s “Community Service” Federal Work Study student. In total, 12,264 hours, completed by 830 students, were dedicated to HCFB and its partner agencies in the 2012-13 academic year, which equates to approximately 17% of our students who participated in service connected to the issue of hunger.

To strengthen the partnership between FGCU faculty, students, and HCFB and its affiliated partners, FGCU invited many of these agencies and others to participate in a Campus Community Dialogue, sponsored by the “Bringing Theory to Practice” Grant through the Association of American Colleges and Universities. These funds allowed faculty and strategic partners to formulate new institutional structures that maintain reciprocal, mutually beneficial, and sustained partnerships. The objective of the seminar was to generate collaborative policies to improve the academic substance of engaged scholarship for our students and improve the organizational capacity of our community partners. An assessment framework was also created as an outcome of this dialogue and the framework was established to evaluate communication and feedback between FGCU and partner agencies – thus strengthening the relationship and improving long-term benefits between FGCU, HCFB, and its partner agencies.

Institutional support is also evidenced by the approval and funding of the Service Ambassador Position Institutional support is also evidenced by the approval and funding of the Service Ambassador Position (a student-led service reflection leader). FGCU has also addressed the issue of hunger on its own campus. The results of a needs survey (created by students) prompted the creation of a Campus Food Pantry. Our institution provides support for our pantry, which is affiliated with HCFB, by providing on-campus space. In its first year, the pantry, with 88 volunteers serving 1,100 hours, served 665 students experiencing food insecurity.

“Understanding Regional Issues and the Role of Citizenship through engaged service-learning experiences along the Corkscrew Watershed” a partnership between FGCU, CREW, and Bonita Nature Place

Student work at The Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed (CREW), which is dedicated to the preservation and stewardship of the water resources and natural communities in and around the Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed, increased substantially as a result of a STEM Grant supported by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). Florida Campus Compact
(FL/CC), in collaboration with CNCS, partnered with FGCU to bring a STEM Day Institute to its campus. Faculty members submitted applications to become FL/CC STEM Service-Learning Faculty Fellows and then participated in a series of workshops to assist in the creating or retooling of a course that promotes service-learning in the STEM disciplines or a STEM-related community project tied to course curriculum.

One STEM Fellow implemented a service-learning experience at CREW into his Environmental Science course to not only increase students’ knowledge related to course content, but to increase students’ understanding of what it means to be civically engaged. During this semester, students contributed a total of 150 hours of service to the partner agency.  Results gathered from pre/post-tests, surveys, and reflection papers indicated growth in students’ understanding of environmental issues related to both regional and global issues as well as land-use changes in southwest Florida. Moreover, post results showed a strong increase in students’ understanding of the “Role of Citizen,” from the pre-survey responses: many even increased from a “Zero degree” of understanding to a “Fairly High Degree” of understanding when it came to continuing service within the STEM community.

This project and partnership with CREW opened the door for this instructor to build and maintain additional reciprocal partnerships with local, environmental non-profit organizations located along this Watershed, many which include educational centers. This network of partners allows his students in Environmental Science and Ecosystems of Southwest Florida courses to investigate the urbanization of coastal watersheds and actively engage with the public on science and technology-related issues. By collaborating with each agency to co-develop hands-on service-learning experiences, enriched active learning is occurring in the classroom, and specific community needs are being identified and met. Some additional examples of students’ engaged scholarly products that have resulted from this grant and these courses include Geographic Information System (GIS) trail maps, Tree Monitoring, QR code
Interpretive Trails, and Botany Mapping. These projects allow students to be producers of web-based content that relates to education and ecological perspective. These student projects are then shared with the regional, non-profit agencies, their science education centers, and the community at-large to support community needs. For example, thousands of visitors to these environmental sites are educated about the surrounding flora, fauna, and other geographic details surrounding the Watershed through the QR codes displayed within each property. 

Bonita Nature Place, a local nature center, located along the Watershed, that promotes conservation and environmental stewardship through education, has been the recipient of many of these hands-on, course-based, service-learning projects. Fourteen students in the 2012-2013 academic year dedicated 97 hours of service to this agency. This site was also included as a strategic partner in FGCU’s Make A Difference Day, Day of Service, sponsored by a grant with Wells Fargo, procured through the FGCU Foundation. Many of these environmental agencies along the Watershed were also a part of an Environmentally Focused Campus-Community Dialogue sponsored by FGCU’s Office of Service-Learning and Civic Engagement to build and strengthen partnerships between FGCU faculty, students, and community partners.

This allows members of the community that have limited land to grow fresh, nutritional food. It also fosters community relationships and a feeling of accomplishment and unity. 

SRU also partners with the local community in the annual Fall leaf collection program, with the leaves disposed of at the Macoskey Center composting windrows; the compost is then used for campus landscaping. A very successful free, two-day community E-Waste collection program sponsored by SRU's EH&S Department is also held during Spring semester (as part of our Earth Week activities) each year. SRU provides staffing resources, shared property resources, and free e-waste recycling by a certified vendor to support the above activities.",True,"SRU student interns from the Slippery Rock Student Energy Accelerator (SEA) partner with the local community and employ the Triple Bottom Line sustainability principles in helping local businesses, nonprofits, and SRU departments become more sustainable and energy efficient, with mentoring provided by faculty and/or Office of Sustainability staff.  One (of many) examples is a student group that worked with the North Country Brewery (a microbrewery pub and restaurant) in Slippery Rock  to conduct an energy audit and identify ways to decrease energy costs, and to assist the Owner in applying for energy conservation tax credits. Proposals for a photovoltaic alternative energy system for the restaurant were also coordinated and evaluated for the Owner.  These projects typically transpire over fairly long (one, two, or more semesters) time frames, with SRU providing staff support and sharing of facilities resources for meetings, workshops, etc.",True,"The SRU President's Commission on Sustainability includes representative members of the entire university community as well as the community at large.

Ogden United Promise Neighborhood

The Ogden United Promise Neighborhood (OUPN) initiative came into being in 2009 under the name “Ogden United” as a grassroots effort championed by community leaders to address the increasingly-concentrated needs of residents in the central city.  The “champions” leading the effort include United Way of Northern Utah, Ogden School District, Weber State University, and Ogden City.

Our moderately-sized community has a penchant for collaboration and volunteerism.  Its key civic leaders are directly engaged in this initiative – including health providers and the business community – all of which make Ogden a great place to live, work, and play.

While our community is strong, the current system does not work for many of those in greatest need. Our vision is to ensure that all children and youth growing up in the neighborhood have access to great schools and strong systems of family and community support that will prepare them to attain an excellent education and successfully transition to college and a career. Our goal is to significantly improve the educational and developmental outcomes of children and youth and to transform the community by doing the following:

    Increasing the capacity of community-based organizations focused on children and youth;
    Building a continuum of cradle-to-career educational programs and family and community supports, with great schools at the center;
    Integrating programs and increasing communication to most effectively address community needs;
    Developing the local infrastructure to sustain and scale up proven solutions; and
    Evaluating the overall impact of programs and strategies in the neighborhood to inform ongoing efforts.
