They are overseen by a paid student sustainability intern and the Associate Dean of Residence Life, Becki Simpson. The sustainability coordinators meet every week to plan programs and continue learning. One keynote program the SCs plan is Kill-a-watt, which is outlined below:

Kill-a-watt is a creation-care awareness program in the residence halls, during January. This initiative  is structured as an inter-residence hall competition where students earn “Kill-a-watt points” for their hall by participating in program elements and decreasing their hall’s electricity. Student leaders partner with Calvin faculty and staff members, and community members to create rich educational experiences for our students during Kill-a-watt.

Kill-a-watt Desired Outcomes
•	Students will explore connections between the Christian faith and environmental stewardship. 
•	Students will reflect on their lifestyle choices and how their choices impact others. 
•	Students will learn more about environmental stewardship, including specific issues such as: consumerism, wonder, sustainable agriculture, food justice, and pollution.
•	Students will take small action steps towards changing their behaviors to become more sustainable, through the DREAM certification process and Lifestyle Challenges. 

Kill-a-watt program elements:
Leadership training
- 300 student leaders attend a 1.5-hour leadership training, where they are trained in how to support the various elements of Kill-a-watt, and how to get their peers involved in the program. 

Kick-off Event
•	400-500 students attend the Kill-a-watt Kickoff, which featurs Calvin’s IMPROV team and a prominent speaker to learn importance of creation care, and to learn details about how they can get involved in the Kill-a-watt program. In 2015, the college president spoke at this event, about his personal commitment to sustainability and the practical ways in which he tries to live sustainably in his personal life. 

•	“Sustainability Cokes & Clubs’” followed the Kickoff: Students visited various tables set up outside the Kickoff, and learn about opportunities to connect with other sustainability efforts on campus. 

“DREAM” Certification (Dorm Room Environmental Awareness Movement)
•	In 2015, 591 students “DREAM certified” their rooms by taking an online assessment which evaluated the sustainability of their residence hall room and living routines. The survey addressed topics of recycling, energy use, plants, natural lighting, water use, material consumption, and environmental awareness. 
•	Students who earned enough points, according to the pre-assigned rubric, could receive a Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze certification emblem to hang on their door. 

Lifestyle Challenges
•	In 2015, a total of 423 students challenged themselves by trying out new sustainable lifestyle habits for all of interim. Each student who participated signed up for an average of 8 “Lifestyle Challenges”, such as becoming vegetarian, taking shorter showers, riding the bus, unplugging appliances when not in use, using cold water for laundry, or not using Styrofoam for the month. 
•	Challenges ranged from simple 1 and 5-point challenges, to more difficult 10, 20, and 30-point challenges. 

Other Dining Hall Initiatives
•	Dining hall bulletin boards displayed educational posters with information about non-meat protein sources. 

Creation Care Devotional Study
•	Almost every residence hall floor participated in a devotional study that sought to cultivate awareness and attentiveness towards creation. The study was a modified selection of Lenten Devotions on creation care from the Christian Reformed Church of North America. A few days had been chosen for each week and paired with others days to create a two week study. The first week focused on practicing wonder in creation and God’s use of quiet places to speak with us. The second week targeted the “groaning of creation”, the issues the planet is currently facing and what we can do to be good stewards.

Chapel 
•	Calvin students shared about intersections between faith & sustainability in their lives. They spoke about how their faith compels them towards community, wonder, and justice.  

•	Chaplain Aminah Bradford interviewed a Calvin grad turned seminarian turned farmer and community activist, Lance Kraai. He works in the Creston neighborhood with new city urban farms.  They spoke about food, land, reconciliation and faith.  There was a live chicken who was a huge success.

Do-It-Yourself Knight
At a Student Activities weekend event, sustainability coordinators hosted a table where students could stop by and make their own sustainable shampoo and laundry detergent. Over 100 students stopped by the table. 

Residence Hall Events
•	Each residence hall also planned one in-hall event, organized by each hall’s student leaders. Each leadership team received a Resource Guide, which contained ideas for interactive programs, documentaries, and potential guest speakers.
•	In-Hall Programs included:
o	Faculty lectures
o	Plant-potting
o	Documentaries/Movies
o	Dumpster-diving info session

Other All-campus Collaborative Events 
•	Economics of Happiness (Documentary showing, in collaboration with an interim class in which all first-year students enroll)
•	Sustainable Business Forum (Forum Discussion with Haris Alibasic, community sustainability leader,  in collaboration with another student organization, the Calvin Business Forum)

Electricity Usage
•	Electricity usage was measured for each residence hall, scaled for occupancy, and compared to usage in previous months. Points were awarded based on how much each hall decreased its energy, compared to prior months.  

Faculty/Staff Engagement  
In 2015, students were encouraged to invite faculty and staff members to become honorary members of their residence hall’s Kill-a-watt team. Faculty and staff members participated in Lifestyle Challenges and attended events, earning double points for their honorary residence hall. 




In addition to Kill-a-watt, the Sustainability Coordinators planned the following in 2015: 

Grand River Clean-Up
In September, the Sustainability Coordinators and their friends participated in the annual Mayor’s Grand River Clean-up. We joined over one thousand people who volunteered to collect trash along the Grand River and Plaster Creek. We joined with the Environmental Stewardship Committee (the student ESC) and students from Calvin’s Creation Care floor to pick up trash along Plaster Creek, which was especially meaningful since Calvin is located in the Plaster Creek watershed. The day started and ended at a park along the Grand River downtown. Many of our team members biked together to the event.

Stewardship Worship Night
During the first week of October, the Sustainability Coordinators (SCs) teamed with their dorm Barnabas leadership team to create a dorm worship night centered on stewardship and wonder of God’s good creation. The SCs found verses, songs, poems, and prayers for the dorm worship. They put together a powerpoint presentation and went through it with their worship Barnabas team to make sure it would be timed appropriately and that the songs were all familiar for the dorm worship musicians. The event went well and was a great model for collaboration between various leadership groups on the CLC team. A totall of about 300 students attended in the various halls. 

Mad Farmer Food Fest 
On May 2, 2015, the Mad Farmer Food Festival was held in KE as a celebration of the provision, joy, and gift of food. The goal of this even was to raise awareness of food issues from a faith perspective. We began with a devotion by RD, Richard France-Coe, which was followed by several breakout session offerings on the following topics: Roasting your own coffee beans, protecting the rights of migrant workers, dumpster diving and consumerism, and restoring hope through a local refugee farming program.   About 100 people were in attendance. Lunch from a local businesses was available for a small fee and a full student band also played during the event. The keynote speaker was Steven Bouma-Prediger, a renowned author who is from Holland, Michigan. This event was was open to all Calvin students, faculty, staff and community members.

CERF Celebration (Calvin Energy Recovery Fund)
In early May, CERF celebrated that it had saved over $100,000 dollars and 1 million KWh through their energy reduction projects. The CERF interns reached out to the SC team for brainstorming on how to celebrate this milestone. Some SC members helped to design some aspects of the Scavenger Hunt and a few others were on teams that hunted around campus on May 7th to find some of the CERF items on campus (such as engineering design posters or the light monitors). Sustainability Coordinators also helped promote the “brown out” event in which lights were turned off during a certain time period as a way to commemorate CERF’s achievement. 

Plaster Creek Stewards Spring Work Day (Rain Gardens)
On April 18, Plaster Creek Stewards hosted an event to plant rain gardens in areas along the Plaster Creek. SC members promoted this event in the halls to encourage people to attend and learn about rain gardens. During the event, Gail Hefner gave a presentation about what rain gardens do and how they help to improve water quality in the degraded Plaster Creek. Then volunteers road buses to sites to plant native species that will filter the water in key locations along the creek.

","Sustainability Coordinators apply online. After they apply, they have a one-on-one interview with the Associate Dean of Residence Life and/or the Sustainability Intern (paid student position). After interviews, the Associate Dean asks the applicant's Resident Direct for input on whether they would recommend this student, and then makes a hiring decision. ","Sustainability Coordinators arrive to campus a week before classes start, and have a full week (50 hours) of training. SCs participate in general leadership training to learn about intercultural competency, facilitation skills, being a good role model, and understanding how their work plays a role in the bigger picture of God's kingdom work. Then they attend sustainability-specific trainings. They go on a sustainability-focused tour of campus to learn about and see Calvin's green initiatives. They also hear from various faculty and staff members about various sustainability topics. In addition, they visit a few community organizations to learn about the sustainability work that is going on outside of Calvin. They participate in a few readings and end the week with an overnight retreat, focused on team-bonding, goal-setting, and reflection. ","The Residence Life Department covers most expenses for this program, including: 
Time from the Associate Dean of Residence Life
Paid sustainability intern (up to 10 hours/week average)
Honorariums for speakers
Printing costs for posters
Supplies for ""Do it yourself Knight"", for students to make their own shampoo and laundry soap

This CUPPS (Cannot Use Paper Plastic Styrofoam) mugs program urges students to reuse mugs instead of using plastic, paper, or Styrofoam cups. ESC also participates in environmental events in the community such as The Grand River Clean-Up, Plaster Creek Steward events, and film or lecture series by local environmental organizations (such as West Michigan Environmental Action Council). ESC tries to set up an environmental petition in partnership with a campaign every year. In the past, we have participated in a petition against Kellogg’s use of palm oil with Forest Heroes and raised signatures for several environmental initiatives involving reformation of Michigan laws and policies to become more sustainable for the environment. Besides social and political action toward environmental sustainability, ESC also volunteers at events for conservation and restoration efforts. Ultimately, ESC’s aim is to provide a welcoming atmosphere of environmentally concerned and passionate students and provide these students with the opportunities to take action and learn about issues in the world and our local community (Calvin College and the Grand Rapids area).","ESC student leaders volunteer and are accepted by previous student leaders who believe that the volunteer has participated and invested in ESC in the past and will inspire environmental awareness and action and be a good leader for the group.

The EcoReps are a group of students working in partnership with the Dining, Housing and Environmental Stewardship departments in order to make Columbia’s campus more environmentally sustainable.  Undergraduate EcoReps supervise and encourage a sustainable lifestyle in their residence halls on campus by implementing recycling programs (such as videos demonstrating how items are recycled on campus), encouraging students to save energy (through the Campus Conservation Nationals Energy Challenge), and creating educational events for the students.  Their work entails publicizing available environmental services, serving as a bridge of communication between students and the administration, facilitating campus projects for a reduced university ecological footprint.  EcoReps is split into six committees that all work on different projects in those areas and aim to educate students on different issues and encourage environmental practices.  The committees are Bike Share, Dining, Composting, Living Green, Give + Go Green, and Recycling.  Some examples of EcoReps outreach activities include:  The Bike Share program offers a way for students to get around the city and exercise in a sustainable way--on a bike.  The Dining  Committee facilitates Plate Scrapings about three times a semester and encourages students not to waste food.  The Composting Committee provides a way for students in residence halls the option of composting their food scraps in the basement of one of the residence halls.  The Living Green Committee focuses on improving the behaviors of students in residence halls such as offering plastic bag recycling.  The Give + Go Green program involves targeting students moving out at the end of the year and encourages them to donate items that they will not be shipping/taking home with them instead of throwing it away.  The items are stored over the summer and sold back to the students at low prices in the Fall and these funds fund the EcoReps programming.  The Recycling Committee focuses on recycling and educating students on how to recycle properly on campus (follow NYC Recycling laws) and advertises the importance of recycling in an engaging and dynamic way (the committee is creating videos).
","At the beginning of each semester, the EcoReps leadership (Executive Board=2 Co-Presidents, 1 Secretary, 1 Media Liaison, 1 Treasurer) send out applications to join EcoReps and host an introductory meeting.  The individuals apply and then the Eboard assigns each individual to a specific committee aligned with his/her primary interests.  The majority of EcoReps' commitment spans the full academic year.  New EcoReps are accepted throughout the year as it's important to engage as many students as possible in the programs. 
","EcoReps from the previous year conduct training to the new EcoReps.  Additionally ongoing guidance and training is provided by Housing with support from Environmental Stewardship.
","EcoReps  support themselves financially with the funds they have raised through the Green Sale.  While being a Columbia EcoRep was once a paid position, the EcoReps themselves chose to operate on a volunteer basis and put their salaries into a programming fund to use on green initiatives totaling approximately $15,000.  At the beginning of the academic year, the EcoReps host a used goods Green Sale, where they sell lightly used room furnishings and other household and office goods – most of which are donations from the Give + Go Green event at the end of the school year. Earnings from the Green Sale also help to fund the EcoReps program for the academic year.

The director of sustainability and the sustainability office student manager ran the training sessions in collaboration with other departments to educate the students about the College's sustainability initiatives, how to engage in those initiatives, and how to educate their peers about the initiatives. Resident assistants attended this training and also received additional training over the summer that is specifically designed for RAs.","All students who are hired as work study students in departments participating in the Green Job Corps program were required to attend the fall training sessions. Participating departments were diverse, including Admissions, the Learning Center, Sustainability, Student Involvement, Green Map, Cerridwen Farm, Residence Life and others. Workers were hired based on skill sets that meet the traditional job responsibilities outlined by their department as well as innovative job responsibilities required of the Green Job Corps, including the ability to promote and improve social, financial, and environmental systems on campus. Many of the job descriptions outlined all of the job duties within the triple-bottom line categories and place a Green Job Corps logo on the document so that students know the job they are applying to is included in the program, and should be viewed in the context of sustainability.","The primary way student educators were trained through this program is through the fall training session. During this session, which lasted two and a half hours, students first listened to a presentation on “sustainability 101,” which familiarizes them with all of the College’s current, major sustainability initiatives and gives them an opportunity to ask questions about these initiatives. This trained participants to be a first line of defense for spreading information about sustainability efforts on campus and dispel myths that oversell or undersell the impact of the programs. Students were then asked to list all the ways they’ve personally and professionally helped advance sustainability goals on campus. This list was used as an impetus for small groups to begin making lists of departmental goals for the year.

Groups were then provided with poster paper and asked to develop a wheel-and-cogs model for creating inter-departmental goals. One representative for each department stayed at each table, while the other participants walked around to different tables adding goals to other posters. Students pledged to share these goals with their supervisors and institutionalize them into their official duties for the year. Finally, students were taught how to incorporate Green Job Corps goals into their resumes when they succeed at accomplishing them. Similar training was also provided to staff supervisors and follow-up communication directed students and staff to incorporate goals into their official duties and use them as benchmarks for official work evaluations.

Resident Assistants received additional training before the fall training session in order to be prepared to educate new residents about sustainability. This preemptive training takes place in August before the new students arrive on campus. Training covered the existing sustainability systems and sustainability goals so that RAs can help new students participate in these systems and feel motivated to help the College reach its goals. The training also included sustainability ideas that could be incorporated into their floor programs that they carry-out for residents. Examples of past sustainability-related floor programs have included sewing and patching, local food sampling,
sustainable holiday planning, floor-wide clothing swapping, recycling, sustainable living, and paper-making.

Finally the session also covers one topic in-depth. In 2013, the topic was knowing your bioregion. RAs were taught why it's important to be able to name a handful of plant and animal species in your region. If you have a close relationship with a few species, then you can notice even the slightest changes to their population sizes and habitats. It's a way of keeping track locally of large abstract phenomena such as global climate change or loss of biodiversity. RAs are encouraged to find ways to communicate the main lesson of the training session to their residents. 

","The director of sustainability, the sustainability office manager, and several key staff members in the Provost’s Office and Career Services work closely to develop the major Green Job Corp training sessions. The Sustainability Office provided a free meal during the training for all participants, as well as follow-up consultation and guidance throughout the year. This follow-up guidance included copies of the presentation, copies of the goals the students created, and tips on how to make the most of out of the Green Job Corps experience.
 
The Sustainability Office also developd the preemptive training for the RAs, which is supported by Residence Life. Residence Life gives RAs $40 each month for floor programming, but it is not required that they spend this money on sustainability-related programming, even though they often do. The Sustainability Office also provided every RA with a ""cheat sheet"" outlining major sustainability initiatives and facts that they can share with their residents.

They accomplish this by ensuring proper labeling of recycling bins at Reunions sites, which they also monitor; marching in the P-Rade with eye-catching, informational recycling signs; and by being available for any questions that alumni may have. 

Greening Move Out: To reduce the amount of end-of-year waste, the EcoReps work with Building Services each year to place collection bins at about 20 sites across campus. Students are encouraged to donate books, school supplies, clothing, unopened food and toiletries, furniture, and other reusable materials.","The Office of Sustainability recruits and hires two to three EcoRep leaders by reviewing student applications and conducting interviews with the applicants, many of whom have previously served as group members.

Their primary goal is to promote sustainable living practices and conservation of resources in Smith's student houses. Eco-Reps also organize campus wide activities that engage the entire  student body, as well as faculty, staff, and the Northampton community. 

Eco-Reps are elected by their fellow housemates each year and form a group of 40 to 50 students. The group is managed by Emma Kerr, the campus sustainability coordinator, with the help of students facilitators who are interns with the Office of Campus Sustainability.  Eco-Reps serve as liaisons from the Office of Campus Sustainability to the student body.  


Each October the Eco-Reps organize Fall Fest. This event showcases all of the green student organizations on campus and helps students understand what sustainability is about at Smith. This event is zero waste and serves as a major outreach opportunity from green organizations to the student body, and brings all of the diverse green organizations together to foster year-long collaboration. It also allows Eco-Reps to have a campus wide presence, and for students to engage with their house's Eco-Reps in a fun and educational environment. 

Eco-Reps also participate in Earth Week by tabling and organizing events.  These events often include a water conservation contest called April Showers, where students are challenged to take shorter showers, using 5 minute shower timers, which are distributed by Eco-Reps to all bathrooms.  Houses compete against each other.  

Eco-Reps also present Sustainabili-Teas in their houses.  Smith's houses have a long-standing tradition of gathering for ""Tea"" on Friday and weekend afternoons, and teas are often used as opportunities for different groups to present or lead activities.  Sustainabili-Teas touch on all aspects of sustainable living and highlight ways to reduce your house's environmental footprint, like turning off lights in common spaces, reducing water use, recycling, composting, and making conscious food choices. 
","During annual house elections, houses elect Eco-Reps who act as liaisons between students in the house and the Office of Campus Sustainability, as well as other campus environmental programs.","Eco-Reps meet every other week during fall and spring semesters.  The first meeting is longer to include a short training on what it is like to be an Eco-Rep, as well as background information on recycling and composting on campus, where our energy comes from, and how to reduce your house's energy use.  Eco-Reps are issued an Eco-Rep Guide which includes all of this information.

Each winter we also hold an Eco-Rep retreat at the MacLeish Field Station, where Eco-Reps receive additional training, focused around how to host a successful Sustainabili-Tea, and various activities to incorporate into the program. 

While bi-weekly meetings are generally used for planning teas, events, and initiatives, they are sometimes used for additional training throughout the year.  As an example, Eco-Reps this spring will be going through a tabling workshop, taught by a local organization called the Center for EcoTechnology.  This workshop will focus around how to grab and hold someone's attention, how to start conversations, and how to engage with people who have different interest levels.  

Eco-Reps also have the opportunity to come to office hours, where the campus sustainability coordinator and the student Eco-Rep facilitators can train them to work through the steps of organizing and planning events on campus. 


","The Office of Campus Sustainability provides a staff person (the campus sustainability coordinator) to oversee the Eco-Reps.  The Office of Campus Sustainability also employs three paid interns to help coordinate the Eco-Reps and assist with campus-wide event planning (in particular with Fall Fest and Earth Week events).  

Since the Eco-Reps are largely a student-run organization, they are also supported by various college funds that provide funding for free campus-wide student events.  Eco-Reps can apply to these funds for budgets that allow them to bring speakers to campus and execute other programs.  

As part of their House Council, Eco-Reps are also supported by their House Presidents, Head Residents, and Residence Life staff.  ",--,--,,,,,--,--,,,,,--,--,,,,,--,--,--

Peer Wellness Coaching is a coaching program designed to help students set a wellness goal and work towards it with the support from a peer coach (similar to the other academic coaching programs on campus).   With the focus on wellness, a student can work one-on-one with a fellow student on goals related to any of the eight dimensions of wellness and develop the skills needed to form healthy habits.  Examples of wellness goals can be related to areas such as stress management, time management, goal-setting, relationship-building, and work/study/life balance.

Peer Wellness Coaching are a key component of the wellness outreach of UBC Student Health Service. Using a peer-to-peer approach, the Peer Wellness Coaches enhance campus wellbeing by: 
•	Engaging in in-person and online coaching conversations with students.
•	Providing a warm, safe and professional environment, both in person and online, for any student from any faculty to discuss their wellness and overall UBC experience.
•	Support students in developing wellness goals and creating action plans to work towards achieving them through skill development.

Interns work to improve current sustainable practices for Residential Dining Services and Residential Dining’s sustainable efforts. This is accomplished by student interns researching assigned projects, collecting and inputting data, and providing recommendations to Dining Services. Examples of outreach projects that student interns work on include Sustainability Week, a week-long celebration focusing on sustainable efforts where interns table in the dining commons to educate students about sustainable food initiatives; Seafood Day, a program where interns educate students about the Dining Service's sustainable seafood program and engage with students on the importance of purchasing sustainable fish; and Earth Day, a program where interns educate students about a climate-friendly diet. In addition to tabling in the Dining Commons, student interns also develop educational brochures and PowerPoint slides for the programs to aid in their outreach efforts. Student interns also assist in tracking dining utilities, such as the amount of water, gas, electric, and food waste that are used by the Dining Services. This data is used to help the Dining Services work towards achieving more sustainable practices and to remain Green Business Certified. Dining Commons Interns also engage in outreach activities through tabling once per month during Green Mondays; during these particular days, interns engage with students about the nutritional and environmental benefits of consuming a vegetarian meal.

The students most affected by the Environmental Interns are the students who have an active meal plan on campus and are directly exposed to the education opportunities provided by Dining Services. Interns are there to educate other students and provide them with educational tools to make the best possible eating decisions, therefore the interns gain valuable experience in food and sustainability outreach and education.

At the core of the program is an online training series focused on topics in sustainability, particularly as they apply at UofL.

Once you become an Eco-Rep, you’re expected to serve as a resource person for sustainability in your sub-community at UofL, whether it’s your immediate peers and colleagues, your department, your building, your club, your residence hall, or any other realm where you live, work, and play. We encourage Eco-Reps to become conscious of the specific physical and social systems in their own departments or residence halls, and to help their peers understand the options and advantages of more sustainable solutions during planning meetings or when designing systems.

Eco-Reps stand for sustainable action, so we also encourage participants to actively demonstrate their personal commitment in those places where they can have the most impact. Eco-Reps are not “green police.” Eco-Reps are educators and mentors. As an Eco-Rep, you should feel free to politely observe and make note of problem behaviors or unsustainable systems, but you should always be courteous, respectful and supportive rather than punitive. Eco-Reps should also be a voice for sound practices regarding our campus environment, its inhabitants, and the planet at large. Eco-Reps should always strive to “practice what they preach” and to lead by example.

Eco-Reps are expected to attend our monthly workshops to expand their exposure to sustainability concepts and locals making a difference. There they can discuss their own sustainability activities in a public forum (with food!), and report on their activities and ideas about sustainable practices to UofL's Sustainability Council. We also expect EcoReps to submit a brief monthly report designed to help everyone brainstorm and document more effective strategies for Eco-Reps representation across campus.

Eco-Reps also engage in group service projects to engage the community around UofL in some highly visible and meaningful efforts.

Participants are encouraged to register for the written examination for Eco-Reps Basic certification. Certified Eco-Reps then educate peers at UofL, lead workshops, and offer their expertise to community projects both on and off campus. ","At the core of the program is an online training series focused on topics in sustainability, particularly as they apply at UofL. The series is not intended to be exhaustive concerning sustainability as a whole, nor any individual topic, but the intent is to empower and educate our students, staff, and faculty about the different ways UofL is addressing sustainability and what the UofL community must do in order to help move forward.

There are two tiers of training for Eco-Reps at the University of Louisville - both a Basic and an Advanced program.

Participants are encouraged to register for the written examination for Eco-Reps Basic certification. Certified Eco-Reps then educate peers at UofL, lead workshops, and offer their expertise to community projects both on and off campus. 

Those interested in going deeper can also become certified in Advanced Sustainability Topics through the Eco-Reps Advanced certification program. The Advanced program offers serious sustainability advocates the opportunity to work with a UofL mentor in a particular sustainability area to develop a focused project that addresses the needs of the university or wider community. The Advanced program begins with video training about a particular topic, such as bicycling for transportation, making solar panels, or vermiculture. You’ll then explore a set of supplemental materials on the topic and develop a proposal for a community project. Proposals will be reviewed by the Sustainability Council and the Eco-Reps mentor. If approved, the project will be conducted under the supervision of an Eco-Reps mentor. After successful implementation, you’ll receive an Eco-Reps Advanced certification in the special topic and will be listed on UofL's Sustainability website as being among UofL's advanced community mentors available for consultation.

The Eco-Reps training program at UofL relies upon a video series and supplementary materials to create an action-oriented educational experience for anyone interested in sustainability initiatives at UofL.

Fellows are compensated with three credits per semester for their commitment to the Sustainability Initiative and are mentored by a faculty sponsor. Some of the Fellows receive pay as well.  Students and sponsors collaborate to set academic goals and a midterm and final report of some sort is usually expected.

Each fellow is hired to focus on a specific aspect of sustainability on campus. Categories include Energy & Green Building, Green Office Program, Transportation, Waste and Recycling, Media and Marketing, Community Organizing, and Green Games.  Projects are determined on an individual basis to further the implementation of sustainable practices on campus in all of these areas.

In addition to responsibilities to faculty advisors and the planning and implementation of projects, fellows are required to spend a few hours each week in the Sustainable UMass office. This structured time commitment allows for collaboration between fellows and a greater sense of community between all members of the program. In total, participants are expected to spend about nine hours each week on related work.

Fellows will have the chance to attend meetings of the Chancellor's Sustainability Committee which are scheduled monthly.

The Sustainable UMass Fellowship Program aims to continue to make UMass sustainable in all areas of operation while providing an enriching experience for individual program participants.  Fellows will walk away with experience, knowledge and a greater passion for sustainable change than they previously possessed. ",Students apply for Fellowship positions each semester and the UMass Amherst Careers Center advertises all open positions each semester. Students are asked to submit a resume and cover letter and then are interviewed based on their qualifications and the need within the organization by the Campus Sustainability Manager and the Student Sustainability Coordinator.,The new student educators go through a brief training before the semester begins.

Eco-Dores are residents in the housing system who act as “peer educators” and mentor other students to live in a more environmentally sustainable way. Each Eco-Dore is given guidance and support during collaborative educational sessions throughout the year in which they are introduced to a topic related to that month’s theme and brainstorm actions that they could implement in their own residence hall. The goal is that residents of each hall will find their own way to respond to the theme and their own best solution.

Monthly themes and outreach topics include energy conservation; water conservation; consumption; reducing, reusing, recycling; carbon footprint and climate change; sustainable food and dining; transportation; and green building.
","Students fill out an online application early in the fall semester. The application is made up of a series of open-ended questions relating to the students’ interest and background in sustainability. Applicants are chosen based on their answers as well as the residence hall they represent. The goal each year is to choose one representative from each residence hall, with representation across classes. Occasionally, in the case of extremely good applications or larger residence halls, more than one applicant will be chosen for a single residence hall. ","Each month the students attend a two hour training session led by the Sustainability and Environmental Management Office.

The two groups worked together, along with support from the Office of Residential Life, to design the EcoLeaders program during the Fall of 2013. Spring 2014 is the first semester the program was implemented. The program was designed to allow individuals interested in taking a leadership role on sustainability issues to have a structure and support system that empowered them to realize their ideas and effectively implement them. The position is volunteer-based and requires a commitment of 1-3 hours a week. 

The program seeks to train individuals in each of the dorms, as well as senior and off-campus housing areas, to serve as leaders on sustainability in their living spaces. The first corps of 12 EcoLeaders (one in each of the 9 dorms, 2 from senior housing, and one off-campus representative) each implemented a project on an issue related to sustainability (i.e. waste management, water conservation, etc.), while collaborating with one another and receiving administrative support from CCS.  These projects are targeted at specific living spaces (i.e. Main Dorm), departments (i.e. Vassar Athletics), as well as at the student body at large. ","A brief application was sent out to all the students. Applicants were interviewed by Alistair Hall and EcoLeaders were selected based on what they hoped to accomplish and their leadership potential. Students were given preference based on dorm (i.e. all students from Main were considered for the position of Main EcoLeader), except in cases where there were no applicants from a specific dorm. ","The EcoLeaders received one general training at the beginning of the semester on Leadership skills. This training was conducted by Alistair Hall, assistant for sustainability activities. After the initial training, the EcoLeaders met regularly in smaller groups to plan out their proposed projects for the semester. during this meeting, EcoLeaders received additional training on running campaigns/projects, setting appropriate ""SMART"" goals, etc. ","The EcoLeaders are encouraged to work with one another and independently throughout the semester. However, they also are in contact with both the assistant for sustainability activities and a student intern on CCS. CCS provides support, training, and guidance for the EcoLeaders. Additionally, the college has made a small budget to help implement the programs/projects the EcoLeaders implement during the semester. ",Vassar Sustainability Interns,7.0,"Vassar also has an internship program, which employs six to seven students a semester as interns for the sustainability committee.

WWC has over 100 work crews ranging from Plumbing Arts to Recycling and Solid Waste to Archaeology. Our campus is, therefore, run by students.  We have 1 professional plumber for the entire campus and he trains and supervises a crew of 15 students who meet the campus' plumbing needs.  So, when we convert all of our urinals to water-less units its the students who research, order, install and maintain the urinals.
Each of the over 100 work crews have student leaders who assist the staff supervisors in all aspects of leadership.  A few examples that directly relate to sustainability include:
Forestry Crew- students harvest from our 700 forest and mill at our on campus saw mill campus trees that are then used as lumber in all building projects
Farm Crew- students organically operate the 300 acre farm that produces pasture-raised, grass-fed beef, pork and poultry that is served in the cafeteria and sold to the local community
Recycling Crew- students work to divert 50% of the campus waste stream from the landfill
Landscaping Crew- students work to maintain core campus' native plant, grass and wildflower landscape
Computing Services Crew- students work to maintain computer labs while reducing electronic waste and paper usage, and conserving energy
Environmental Leadership Center Crew- students work to produce the campus' annual GHG Inventory, monitor Climate Action Plan Progress, and raise awareness about campus energy use.
For a full list of work crews go to http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~wpo//crews.php","Student educators (aka Crew Leaders) are selected by crew supervisors on the basis of competency, tenure and ability to lead others.","Each Crew has their own particular way of training student educators.  Every-other Wednesday at 4:00, campus functions stop for 1-1.5 hours of crew training focused on team-building, leadership development and safety.
