This work falls into three general categories: (a) actions and campaigns directly influencing OSU’s sustainability, (b) education on sustainability issues, and (c) empowerment of students to tackle their own vision of a better world.

Examples of outreach activities include planning and implementing educational events (e.g. the Energy Civil War, which is a competition to produce the most electricity using the recreation center's elliptical machines, and the Alternative Transportation Fair, a full day of activities geared toward promoting bicycling and other alternatives to the single occupancy vehicle), hosting work parties at their organic garden, staffing booths at campus events, and advertising SSI programs, such as the Bike Loan Program.

Program info at http://sli.oregonstate.edu/ssi ","Student Sustainability Initiative (SSI) staff are 13 paid positions selected based on a competitive application process and hired by the SSI Fee Board.   

SSI Fee Board members (5 voting students) are selected through a competitive application process by previous Board members.  Additionally, 5 non-voting members serve to help inform the process or as ex-officio members.  The selection process and the SSI program are advised by several OSU professionals: the Student Sustainability Advisor, the Civic Engagement & Service Coordinator and the Sustainability Coordinator.  Additional support and advising is also received from other faculty and staff. 

Staff, and to some extent Board members, are selected based on demonstrated personal commitment to sustainability, experience in the sustainability-related fields, and aptitude of candidates for conducting peer learning activities, campaign building and other related activities.  
","SSI staff and board members receive formal training in organizational development, effective campaigning, conflict resolution and non-violent communication, assessment, purchasing, student leadership development, sustainability principles, community organizing and empowerment.  Activities include orientation to sustainability at OSU, namely a 2 hour tour of campus sustainability features. 

Training is conducted by OSU faculty and contracted off-campus professionals and ranges between 3 and 10 days for staff and half day for Board members, plus additional development opportunities throughout the year. ","OSU dedicates a minimum of 2.0 FTE of faculty, staff and graduate student time to SSI.  Other resources include assistance in purchasing, processing payroll and other logistical support, and additional program assistance from departments like Campus Recycling, the academic colleges and many others.  

The SSI budget for FY15 was approximately $374,000, funded from student fees. ",ASOSU Envrionmental Affairs,27650.0,"Environmental Affairs acts to develop awareness of our impact on the world around us, and to educate students on environmental issues. They coordinate student committees to plan Earth Week activities, lectures, debates, movies, and projects that will educate students on all aspects of environmental issues. They actively solicit student participation and lend aid on all aspects of environmental issues.  ",Student leaders at the Associated Students of Oregon State University (ASOSU) are elected through a campus wide vote of all students.  ASOSU leadership then selects the Environmental Affairs Director using a competitive application process.  This is a paid position that coordinates a team of students who deliver programs to the entire campus community and beyond. ,"Much like SSI, ASOSU leadership is trained through multiple day trainings over the summer and fall that, in ASOSU's case, provide emphasis in leadership development, campaign building, intergovernmental and inter-organizational relations and other areas.  ASOSU staff receive additional training specific to their program area.  ","OSU provides robust advising, legal, policy and organizational support to ASOSU.  While it is predominantly a student fee funded program, the university provides multiple layers of support to student government.  The ASOSU president also sits on the OSU leadership team with the university president and his cabinet.  ",Residence Hall Eco-Representatives,1285.0,"Eco-Representatives (Eco-Reps) are hired students responsible for advancing and institutionalizing a culture of sustainability in the residence halls in which they live. This includes:
- Planning and executing sustainability-focused events (at least one per term)
- Advertising and encouraging involvement in campus-wide sustainability events, including inter-hall recycling and energy competitions
- Educating residents about sustainable lifestyles and resources (common methods included staffing a booth, visiting rooms to talk to residents, hanging or creating posters/signage, Facebook posts, and organizing hall events).
- Coordinating their hall's composting pilot program - recruiting participants, educating and engaging participants, and maintaining compost bins (weighing and tracking data, emptying, and cleaning)

Eco-Reps work 5-8 hours per week and are paid hourly. There were four Eco-Reps during FY15, expanding from 3 the previous two years. 
","Candidates were selected following a competitive application process. Students in any residence hall were invited to submit applications. A hiring committee was assembled (made up of the various partners contributing to the Eco-Rep program) to select applicants to interview, conduct interviews, and select three candidates. These top three candidates determined which three halls would have Eco-Reps.","Early in the academic year, Eco-Reps receive specialized training targeted specifically for the types of tasks expected of them.  They attend weekly meetings throughout the year with their supervisor and campus partners and received informal trainings from partners on campus sustainability programs and resources. 

A lesson book was created by the Sustainability Office specifically for the Eco-Rep program. It is based on Northwest Earth Institute course material.  Content is read and reviewed at each Eco-Rep weekly group meeting with a facilitated discussion led by the OSU Sustainability Coordinator.  ","Four campus entities contributed funds to build a $5,300 budget for FY15 wages:
$3,300 from Campus Recycling
$1,000 from University Housing & Dining Services
$500 from the Student Sustainability Initiative
$500 from the Sustainability Office

These same partners offer additional resources, such as printing and supplies, as needed, for Eco-Reps' projects. The Residence Hall Association also provided access to their resource room (which offered computers, printing and office supplies) and the Hall Councils provided funds for event materials when Eco-Reps requested them.

In addition, partners contributed staff time to support Eco-Reps, as needed. In particular, the Sustainability Office supported and supervised the Eco-Reps, providing training, work assignments, admin support, etc.",Student Outreach Assistant in the Campus Recycling office,27650.0,"Campus Recycling's Student Outreach Assistant position is a paid student position that focuses on educating and engaging the OSU community (primarily students) in recycling and waste reduction.

Training is provided to the new student employee each time it is filled by a new person.
