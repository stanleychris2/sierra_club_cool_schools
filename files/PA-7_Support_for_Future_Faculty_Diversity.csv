The Graduate Student Programs office aids academic units in improving the quality of their programs to promote 
their success in the national collegiate arena with the objective of making their programs more visible to prospective students, faculty and graduate alumni. The primary mission is to provide assistance with and oversight of graduate recruitment, fellowships, and other aspects of graduate students’ non-academic services.

Science Foundation of Arizona (SFAz) provides up to two years of financial support for first year doctoral students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. It is a competitive fellowship and new doctoral students must be nominated by their Academic Unit (AU) for the award. Each year of the award carries a $25,000 personal stipend plus a $5,000 supplemental allowance to funding research and related expenses. Full tuition is also covered by the fellowship. Second year support is contingent upon outstanding performance and progress toward the degree.

Reach for the Stars (RFTS) is a graduate fellowship designed to support Arizona residents and students pursuing a master’s degree, who 
are underrepresented in their field of study. The department nominates students newly admitted to a master’s program at Arizona State University. The Graduate College supports the RFTS Fellows with a $15,000 stipend and resident tuition during the first year of their master’s program. The student’s Academic Unit (AU) provides student health insurance for the first year. In the second year, the fellow’s academic unit will provide them with a Teaching Assistantship (TA) or Research Assistantship (RA), or financial equivalent.

The Doctoral Enrichment Fellowship (DEF) is a graduate fellowship designed to support underrepresented students in their field of study.  The department nominates students in the first year of their doctoral program. The Graduate College supports the DEF Fellows during the first year of their doctoral degree program with a $17,000 stipend, resident tuition, and non-resident fee award (if applicable). The student’s AU provides student health insurance in the first year. In the second year, the fellow’s academic unit will provide them with a
TA or RA position, or financial equivalent.

The Diversity across the Curriculum (DAC) Seminar Series consists of roundtable discussions, presentations, and a speaker series, designed to increase understanding of the diversity of research at ASU and to promote networking within the ASU community across disciplines. DAC provides an opportunity for graduate students, funded by the Graduate College, to master his/her ability to communicate with the public and with their own colleagues on a variety of topics regarding all aspects of their graduate research experience.

The Social and Academic Mentoring (SAM) Program matches Arizona State University’s prospective, new, and continuing students with advanced graduate students to help acclimatize the new students to graduate education at ASU. The purpose of the SAM Mentorship is to support academic success and professional development. SAM also supports the development of peer-to-peer mentorship in established ASU student support services and student organizations that promote the graduate school agenda. The Graduate College employs SAM Mentors to be placed in academic settings that specialize in increasing diversity (i.e., The Department of Transborder Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies, American Indian Studies Program, African-American Studies Program). The SAM Mentor is briefed by Graduate College staff on SAM responsibilities and expectations. The SAM mentors may commit from 3-10 hours per week for the semester or
academic year.

Shades is multicultural peer mentoring program where underrepresented students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines are mentors for each other, employing multi-level mentoring. Graduate students informally support each other as they work together, and as they mentor undergraduates. The Graduate College has complete supervision of the Shades application process for mentors and mentees. The Graduate College assigns a mentorship based on the submitted applications. The Graduate College monitors the mentorship, guaranteeing that the social and academic goals are maintained.

Beloit College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 13:47:32,chapmanlr@beloit.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"One of the goals of the Office of Academic Diversity and Inclusivity is to devote explicit attention to the recruitment and retention of students, faculty, and staff from underrepresented groups.

Data shared in Spring 2015 by the offices of Institutional Research and Enrollment Management confirmed that the student population represents the most diverse of Beloit’s four major constituencies – trustees, faculty, staff, and students. The College Administration is now tailoring efforts to diversify faculty and staff, and to reimagine  retention efforts. At their request, we have consulted with two STEM programs that are exploring new ways of reaching underserved populations and preparing their majors to one day become liberal arts faculty. We began our work on this concern by reviewing the new antiracism statement adopted by senior staff that now appears in all employment ads. We are working with Provost Ann Davies, Lori Rhead, Vice President for Human Resources and Operations, and Heather McLean, Director of Human Resources, on the development of more formal procedures for the composition of search committees and on processes that constitute a successful search – and embedding higher levels of transparency on both fronts. We welcomed the invitation extended by the Provost to become involved in the work that had already begun with Dean Klawitter, task force member Cecil Youngblood, Associate Dean of Inclusive Living and Learning, and others. Some members of the administration already have begun to institute and/or consider benchmarks that directly address the potential of faculty and staff appointments to attract and retain individuals from populations traditionally underserved by higher education, generally, and at Beloit College, specifically. We recognize that success on this front is tied directly to an institutional commitment to institute cultural change that is broadly endorsed and shared. The President’s appointment of Cecil Youngblood and Dr. Truesdell to senior staff – the first African Americans to formally serve as members of the college’s senior leadership team – is a good first step.

Under the direction of the Provost, Beloit submitted a successful application for inclusion in an ACM-CIC project to diversify the professoriate. We are excited about the possibility of tying a faculty fellowship to a tenure-track appointment for future professors whose background and life experience enhance our faculty diversity as well as enrich student learning. Task force members will join groups representing the college at two workshops scheduled later this month; one related to the ACM-CIC Undergraduate and Faculty Fellows Program, the other is an assessment initiative organized by the Wabash Center for Teaching and Learning. At the latter, the Beloit group will focus on conceptualizing and developing assessment and evaluation mechanisms around diversity, inclusion, and equity.  Additionally, the task force is collaborating with the Faculty Status & Performance Committee (FS&P) and the Curriculum Oversight and Administration Committee (COA) as they assess the “C” (intercultural literacy) requirement, and with leaders of the Initiatives Programs as they continue to emphasize social identities and student agency.

We also have been intentional in inviting members of the campus and larger Beloit community to join one of the 11 “cell” groups that are operating across the campus, and involve roughly 50 members. Similar to Sustained Dialogue groups, cells extend the reach of the task force, serving as avenues through which we increase dialogue about inclusivity initiatives, and expand the level of perspectives that influence how and what we do, support, and/or recommend.  Rest assured that cell groups are about more than just talk; in fact some already have clarified measureable contributions they will make to inclusivity initiatives. Moreover, cells include members of the newly organized Staff Advisory Committee that is examining staff compensation.",--,--

A variety of initiatives and efforts over the years reflect this.

In a series of recent votes, the Faculty approved important measures to support and strengthen faculty diversity. This included the approval of a target-of-opportunity hiring policy in 2008, the approval of a Policy on Increasing Faculty Diversity in 2009, and the creation of a Committee on Faculty Diversity in 2010, and its renewal in 2015. The 2009 policy, developed and enacted by the Faculty, reaffirmed the commitment to increase the diversity of the faculty and to implement specific practices for the recruiting, hiring, supporting, and retaining faculty in ways that directly impact that goal. As stated by the faculty group which initiated this renewed policy, “enhanced diversity among the faculty is an essential component of [Bowdoin’s] mission.” Now, every search for a faculty member follows specific practices aimed at maximizing the diversity and excellence of candidate pools. The Committee on Faculty Diversity is comprised of tenured faculty members, whose charge is “to promote the hiring and retention of a diverse faculty at Bowdoin by serving as outside members on tenure-track searches, and by undertaking other activities to increase the diversity of the faculty.”

In addition, for many years, Bowdoin has participated in the Consortium for Faculty Diversity, successfully recruiting and hiring four to six postdoctoral fellows each year. This is one of several programs at Bowdoin to bring postdoctoral teaching fellows to campus which contribute to the vitality and diversity of our campus community in numerous ways.

Once hired, Bowdoin faculty are supported through various efforts, including ongoing individual and group mentoring in their home departments/programs and with the Associate Dean for Faculty Development. Support encompasses explicit mentoring about career trajectory, network building, teaching, scholarship and publishing. Bowdoin faculty are also supported by a number of institutional structures such as the Advisory Committee for a Diverse Community, a standing committee “in charge of supporting the diverse identify groups that constitute our campus community” and College policies that reflect and protect Bowdoin’s distinctive values as a diverse learning community.",http://www.bowdoin.edu/academic-affairs/forms-policies/faculty-diversity.shtml,--

Coastal Carolina University,2015-11-20,2015-11-20 15:31:25,sustain@coastal.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Consistent with the University strategic plan to increase global awareness and diversity on the Coastal Carolina University campus has developed an initiative to  formalize and professionalize a process to bring qualified faculty members who hold terminal degrees in their fields from international partner schools to teach for short periods of time to offer increased global exposure to the University community and students.  Program benefits include but are not limited to:  exposing Coastal Carolina University students to a more diverse professorate, with different accents, approaches to teaching and approaches to grading; providing Ph.D. qualified faculty with a proven track record of outstanding teaching at our partner institutions to teach in needed course areas within Coastal Carolina University; building strong bridges that help faculty, staff, students, and administration to better understand programs, culture, and processes in place at partner universities, and that enable cross-fertilization and collaboration in teaching, research, and administrative processes; and enabling a longer-term planning and recruitment horizon to enable faculty of the best quality in partner institutions the ability to plan within their own administrative structures to participate in the program.  Academic units are able to request a Visiting International Lecturer or Distinguished International Visiting Lecturer for periods of ½ semester or one full semester.  Each VIL or DIVL will also be responsible for delivering at least one public forum on a topic to be agreed upon with their department.  

The University regularly supports international visiting faculty who are complementing the educational, research, and service initiatives of the institution.  Currently 5 visiting scholars are at CCU, of whom most are engaged in research in partnership with academic units.  In addition, CCU sends its faculty to teach in China (10 in 2014 alone) to gain experience and broaden their research network and therefore enhance the diversity of perspectives brought back to CCU.

The University also sends its faculty to participate in prestigious international conferences and has 15 current former Fulbrighters on its campus (two more have just either received awards or been designated Fulbright Specialists) and 8 of CCU’s retired faculty are former Fulbrighters).  These prestigious programs also bring expertise to our campus.  We have recently also initiated cooperation with the SC Chapter of the Fulbright Association, and Billy Hills (CCU faculty) is now on that board, to bring additional visiting international faculty to CCU on a regular basis at low cost.

Particular emphasis is placed on supporting groups that historically have been underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African American, Hispanic, Native Pacific Islander, and those enrolled in American Indian, and Alaskan Native tribes, and disabled students.

Since 2000, the University has also had a Multicultural Staff & Faculty Network. The mission of this organization is to transform the campus climate and culture in order to foster the empowerment of all CSU employees.  This transformation occurs through the recruitment, retention and development of employees, collaboration with the community to work towards positive change, expansion of social and networking opportunities, and the recognition and rewarding of service.  In addition the organization serves to assure the accomplishment of Colorado State University Strategic Diversity Goals. http://msfn.colostate.edu/.

Additionally, the Recruitment and Retention of Diverse Employees Committee has enacted a campus-wide commitment that diversity language be implemented in the recruitment and retention process which goes beyond mere compliance. Consequently, every new applicant to the university must address their commitment/contribution to Diversity at CSU. And for new recruits, an updated system of diversity training has been implemented which uses mandatory computer and face-to-face sessions. These models have been retroactively fit to every Dean and Cabinet Member at the University and is now being implemented in a top-down fashion such as all of their Leadership Teams are also receiving the training.

Columbia University,2016-01-13,2016-01-13 14:27:24,as3215@columbia.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Columbia University aspires to be the go-to place for the world’s greatest scholars.  We cannot achieve this aspiration without realizing our core values of inclusion and excellence.  Accomplishing this requires that diversity be a fundamental academic accountability for our University, our Schools, and our Departments, and evident through equity in recruiting, advancement, retention, and experience.  Building a diverse community is not the work of a moment, but requires sustained commitment, and concentrated effort and attention.  

In 2010, the Provost established the Office for Academic Planning and appointed Andrew Davidson as Vice Provost for Academic Planning with responsibilities for faculty development, diversity and planning initiatives.  This Office extended and replaced the Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity Initiatives which oversaw the distribution of funds, totaling $22 million from 2005-2009, to support Columbia’s efforts to enhance faculty diversity.  The Office for Academic Planning works in collaboration with the University's academic and administrative units to attract, advance, and retain a diverse faculty to more closely reflect the composition of the national pool of qualified candidates. The creation of this office was spurred by the Provost’s belief that these initiatives are most likely to succeed when they are tightly woven into the core functions and decision making of the institution.   In 2014, the Provost re-affirmed his commitment to this mission by recruiting Dennis Mitchell to the newly created position of Senior Associate Provost for Faculty Diversity and Inclusion.  http://provost.columbia.edu/node/159

The University continues to make significant financial investments in order to advance this work.  In April 2012, President Lee Bollinger and Provost John Coatsworth announced Columbia University’s commitment to investing $30 million to enhance the diversity of its faculty through the recruitment of outstanding female and underrepresented minority scholars.   The program is designed to support Schools’ diversity plans, and to assist the University in meeting placement goals established in its affirmative action programs, by advancing the recruitment and career success of outstanding underrepresented minority and female scholars in disciplines where the availability qualified minorities and women exceeds their representation on our faculty. 

This initiative reflects a shared financial commitment, with $15 million from the University’s central budget matched by contributions from the individual schools to meet the costs of this effort.  This dedication of resources comes with an insistence on accountability and achieving measurable movement toward our goals.  It includes a School-led strategic planning process in which each School receives 10 years of faculty and pipeline diversity data, defines its goals to enhance faculty and pipeline diversity and inclusion, and provides progress reports.  http://news.columbia.edu/home/2722
Columbia’s strategy to enhance the diversity of its faculty has three primary elements:

Three-year diversity goals for every School
• Intended to enhance faculty diversity as a core academic accountability, each School developed 3-year diversity strategic plans, with measurable goals
• The Provost meets with each Dean to discuss progress made on diversity goals, challenges that have been encountered, plans to intervene in areas where the progress has been unsatisfactory, and progress that is expected in the forthcoming academic year

Funding support to enhance faculty and pipeline diversity via $30M commitment in April 2012
• $15M from central funds, matched by $15M from participating Schools, to fund faculty and pipeline recruitment, and faculty career success
• Funds allocated through competitive grant processes, focused on a variety of areas – faculty hiring, junior faculty research support, and pipeline development through doctoral and postdoctoral fellowship support
o Faculty Hiring: Standard and Target of Opportunity Recruitments
o Faculty Development: Junior Faculty Research Grants
o Pipeline Development: Postdoctoral Fellowships, Ph.D. Fellowships, and for undergraduates, the BRIDGE to the Ph.D. in the Natural Sciences
• Every school has participated in this effort by applying for support; over 175 faculty members have been involved as advisers, proposal reviewers, and awardees

Development of a broader framework to reinforce, nourish, and sustain diversity and inclusion.
• Policy development; data collection and feedback; and special programming

A more detailed account of the grant programs, and other diversity efforts, follows.

1. FACULTY RECRUITMENT

This program is designed to support Schools’ diversity plans, and to assist the University in meeting placement goals established in its Affirmative Action Programs, by advancing the recruitment of outstanding underrepresented minority and female scholars in disciplines where the availability of qualified minorities and women exceeds their representation on our faculty.  Our goal is that the composition of our tenured and tenure-track faculty more closely reflects the national pool of qualified candidates.   Funds for faculty recruitment support two kinds of hires.

Support for the Recruitment of Faculty Identified Through Standard Searches 

Schools may request funding support to assist in the recruitment of candidates identified through standard searches from groups whose availability exceeds their representation on the faculty.  The level of support provided by the Provost’s Office is predicated on the assumption that, since there was a Standard Search and Evaluation process, this was a planned recruitment for which Departmental/School funds had already been budgeted.  There may be instances where Schools need additional funds in order to make competitive offers.  In such cases, Schools may request modest supplemental funds from the Provost’s Office to assist with the recruitment.  

 
Target-of-Opportunity Recruitments

While Departments/Schools will normally use the procedures described in its Standard Search and Evaluation Procedures to recruit faculty members, there are situations in which a hiring unit has the opportunity to recruit an outstanding minority candidate, or an outstanding woman candidate in the STEM fields, outside traditional open faculty searches.  In such cases, if the recruitment of the candidate would cause the composition of the faculty to more closely reflect the national pool of qualified candidates, the hiring unit may seek a waiver from the University’s Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action search requirements, and may seek funding support for this recruitment from the Provost’s Office.  RFPs are issued twice a year.  A committee of senior faculty members reviews the applications and makes recommendations to the Provost.  

2. CAREER SUPPORT FOR JUNIOR FACULTY

Junior faculty research grants in which junior faculty who contribute to the diversity goals of the University compete to receive seed grants for research support.  RFPs are issued twice a year.  A committee of senior faculty members reviews the applications and makes recommendations to the Provost.  

In addition to receiving research grants, junior faculty awardees are invited to become part of a cohort.  Cohort events focus on career-support and community-building.  Events have included award luncheons, a panel on career advancement, and informal interviews and meetings to get feedback on how Columbia is doing to create a climate of inclusiveness and support for junior faculty. Results of these interviews and meetings are being used to inform the development and expansion a more robust onboarding program for new tenure-track faculty.

3. PIPELINE DIVERSITY

Pipeline diversity efforts are designed to provide support for members of underrepresented groups at three points in the pre-faculty life-cycle.

Postdoctoral grants.  Schools are invited to compete for funding for postdoctoral position.  RFPs are issued once a year.  A committee of senior faculty members reviews the applications and makes recommendations to the Provost.  

PhD Support.  Fellowships are designed to increase yield of exceptional PhD students who would enhance diversity.
• Fellowships are allocated across all Columbia Schools.

Transition from Undergraduate to PhD.  Funds are allocated to support the transition into STEM PhD programs for post-bac students from underrepresented groups.
• Provost Office supports (in partnership with NSF, Arts & Sciences, and the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research) the Columbia-based Bridge to the PhD Program in the Natural Sciences
 
• Columbia is also the home to a number of transition programs that serve as a bridge for underrepresented minority and female candidates to advance from undergraduate to graduate studies, graduate studies to faculty positions, and junior faculty positions to research independence.

The Sophie Davis BS-DDS Pilot Program Collaboration – College of Dental Medicine
The Sophie Davis BS-DDS Program is dedicated to producing broadly-educated, highly-skilled primary care practitioners to provide quality services to underserved communities.  The program is designed as a seven-year integrated curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) degrees.  After successfully completing the BS degree at The City College of New York, students then transfer to the cooperating dental school for their final two years of clinical training.  In the inaugural year of the program, five students will be accepted for eventual transfer to Columbia University College of Dental Medicine.  

Masters Programs

Sustainable Engineering Graduate Scholars Program: Diversifying the Pipeline to the PhD - School of Engineering and Applied Science
The onset of the 21st century has prompted a reevaluation of the role of engineers in light of current societal and environmental challenges. The goal of this National Science Foundation supported program, Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM), is to prepare a cohort of engineers to meet such challenges, with an emphasis on the areas of water, energy and infrastructure.  Building upon undergraduate and PhD-level engineering education reform undertaken by the faculty team leading the project, this program targets the Masters level.  A research-based M.S. degree will provide S-STEM Scholars with a well-supported “segue” between an undergraduate degree in engineering or applied science and a doctoral program.  The program emphasizes the recruitment and retention of graduate students from underrepresented populations.  Mentoring, cohort building and leadership development are important aspects of the program.

Doctoral and Junior Faculty Programs

Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) Program – School of Engineering and Applied Science
The National Science Foundation’s Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program was developed to meet the challenges of educating U.S. PhD scientists and engineers who will pursue careers in research and education, with the interdisciplinary backgrounds, deep knowledge in chosen disciplines, and technical, professional, and personal skills to become, in their own careers, leaders and creative agents for change. Offering traineeships to students pursuing their PhDs, the program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.  It is also intended to facilitate diversity in student participation and preparation, and to contribute to a world-class, broadly inclusive, and globally engaged science and engineering workforce.  Columbia University is home to four IGERT programs: 

Solving Urbanization Challenges by Design: A New PhD Program Between Architecture and Engineering - School of Engineering and Applied Science
The goal of this IGERT program is to integrate architectural and engineering PhD education in a new interdisciplinary program that aims to fundamentally transform design and planning approaches to contemporary urban expansion. IGERT trainees will make use of emerging science and technology research at the interface of architecture and engineering to develop new paradigms that enable urban areas to adapt to changing requirements, absorb disturbance and effectively reorganize and recover, and reduce their impact on the natural environment.  Collaborations with universities in urban environments located within Europe, Africa and Asia will provide a global perspective to the program. This IGERT program will graduate a cohort of diverse doctoral students who can help shape the policies, priorities, and investments needed for contemporary urbanization. Participants include students and faculty from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, School of International and Public Affairs, Mailman School of Public Health, and Earth Institute.

The energy economy is an immediate and grand challenge that must be tackled by current and future generations of scientists and engineers.  This program addresses this challenge by focusing on technology innovations in two subsystems of direct relevance: next-generation solar photovoltaics, and next-generation efficient optical data and communications networks.  The cross-training scientific research is synergistically integrated with innovative educational approaches and an emphasis on underrepresented groups.  Working with major industrial partners, the IGERT will conduct outreach to undergraduate and K-12 schools in Harlem and Nashville, encouraging underrepresented groups to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas of higher education.

From Data to Solutions: A New PhD Program in Transformational Data & Information Sciences Research and Innovation – School of Engineering and Applied Science
This IGERT program provides PhD students with the interdisciplinary training necessary to extract useful information from vast amounts of collected data.  Consumer opinions, information on disease and its symptoms, and breaking information on social websites allow information gathering on a scale previously unknown.  Columbia University and the City University of New York, in collaboration with international partners in Argentina and Brazil, have created a new program involving the interdisciplinary training of students in making sense of big data.  Researchers from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Psychology, and Statistics are partnering with Biomedical Informatics, Business and Journalism to educate this next generation of information scientists. Aided by advisors from large corporations, major research labs, and small start-up companies, the program encourages IGERT trainees to pursue patents, and to apply their research in society. A major goal of the program is to attract more diverse students to information sciences by emphasizing real world applications, a supportive environment, and diverse faculty role models.

Optical techniques for actuation, sensing, and imaging of biological systems – School of Engineering and Applied Science
In this IGERT program a new generation of scientists and engineers will be trained through a set of five research thrusts that cross three fundamental core competency areas: optics, photonics, and sensor electronics; biomolecular detection and cellular-level analysis; and applications to medicine and public health. With 19 faculty members representing academic departments across Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, School of Arts and Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Teachers College, and incorporating strong interaction with City College, Queens College, and The Cooper Union in New York City, IGERT trainees will experience a truly diverse community sharing in integrated educational and research activities and will be exposed to a wide spectrum of cutting-edge applications. This program fulfills a compelling need to train a diverse workforce of U. S. scientists and engineers trained in an area of large and growing competitive importance to the United States. Significant resources are committed to ensuring recruitment and retention of participants from underrepresented groups.

Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) – Mailman School of Public Health
The Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD), an education project funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented students who enter research careers in public health. The program supports eight doctoral students with one to two years of research mentoring, tuition benefits, and funding to attend scientific conferences. 

HIV Intervention Science Training Program for Underrepresented New Investigators – School of Social Work
Columbia University’s HIV Science Training Program for Underrepresented New Investigators (HISTP), funded by National Institutes of Mental Health, is a multidisciplinary training program that seeks to develop and facilitate the growth of scientists from underrepresented groups conducting HIV-related dissemination and implementation research.  The program’s goals are to address the urgent need to increase dissemination and implementation research to ensure that effective HIV prevention interventions are delivered to the communities that need them, and to train a new generation of HIV researchers to conduct such research to make a major impact in reducing new HIV infections, particularly among communities of color.  Fellows participating in the program receive two years of support via an innovative dual mentorship structure, training seminars, workshops and institutes, pilot study support, and grantwriting assistance.  The program utilizes a distance learning approach which allows junior faculty from across the U.S. to participate from their respective institutions. 

Programs to Increase Diversity Among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research (PRIDE) – Mailman School of Public Health/College of Physicians and Surgeons
The goal of Programs to Increase Diversity Among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research (PRIDE) is to recruit and train junior scientists who can improve public health and reduce health disparities nationwide.  Sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, it provides rigorous training and mentoring opportunities to junior faculty members from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups, disadvantaged backgrounds, and individuals with disabilities and equips them with the essential skills needed to conduct comparative effectiveness research and secure grant funding to address today's most complex health problems.  

4. SUPPORT FOR ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING RELATED TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

The Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Planning has provided support to facilitate conferences and symposia related to race and gender, including funds for:

• The creation of the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Council, 2013-2014
• A conference titled “Are the Gods Afraid of Black Sexuality” in October 2014 (a project of the Institute for Research in African-American Studies)
• A conference titled “Challenging Punishment Conference: Race, Public Health, and the War on Drugs” in October 2013 (a project of the Institute for Research in African-American Studies)

5. PROVOST’S ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF FACULTY DIVERSITY

The Provost’s Advisory Council, formed in 2012, plays a key advisory role to the Provost on the University’s diversity efforts, including:
• Providing expertise and guidance on programs concerning faculty and pipeline diversity, inclusiveness and equity, and faculty development
• Recommending approaches to strengthen the presence, prominence and role of women and underrepresented minorities in leadership positions at Columbia
• Championing the University diversity mission within their academic units, across campus and among external stakeholders

Members of the Advisory Council have also participated in a series of in-depth interviews to learn more about their perceptions of Columbia’s progress in strengthening a climate of inclusiveness and support for junior and senior faculty from underrepresented groups.  Results of these interviews, and junior faculty interviews, have helped to inform the work of the Council and of the Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Planning.

5. DATA INITIATIVES 
The use of data remains a key part of our diversity efforts.  In partnership with the Office of Institutional Research (OPIR), data is compiled to show the race and gender composition of all graduate students and faculty in every department of the University. This data, presented as an overview by year for the last ten years, allows for evaluations of how well departments are incorporating diversity efforts to impact their faculty and student demographics. These data, as well as analyses of any unit lacking female and/or underrepresented minority tenured/tenure-track faculty are made available to diversity leaders at each School.
Office of Work/Life programs support the building of a diverse faculty in a number of ways.  The following services are available to faculty being recruited in addition to current faculty.
Support for Families:
• Affiliated Child Care Centers: arrangements with area early education and child care centers  to prioritize admission of Columbia families
• Backup Care: 100 hours of subsidized backup child care and adult/elder care is available to elgigible faculty and staff 
• Breastfeeding Support Program: private lactation rooms on all campuses equipped with hospital grade pumps – allowing mothers to express milk when they return to work after childbirth
• School and Child Care Search Service: free individual consultation to assist parents with finding child care and schooling for their children in and around New York City

Some minority groups are severely underrepresented in sciences and health care occupations, undermining the nation’s strengths as a leader in science, health and technological advances.  It is becoming increasingly clear that as the population demographics move toward increasing numbers of diverse individuals, the future health and prosperity of the United States will depend on equitable representation and participation in science, health, and technological occupations.

Students will work in a laboratory for eight weeks under the direct supervision of an experienced faculty mentor who will provide hands on training of laboratory personnel.  Students begin studying the mentor’s model system and conduct preliminary experiments after the proper use of instruments has been demonstrated. At the end of the summer program, the students present their summarized research experiences in the form of an oral and poster session at a widely publicized colloquium. Each student will design and arrange the research data and prepare a short paper presenting the introductory background, experimental design, results, and discussion of the research they performed during the summer.  The audience will consist of a panel of judges, the mentors, other interested faculty members, undergraduate and graduate students and the public.

Part I: 
Executive Report and Recommendations
G. Existing Programs and Models for Success
Across the Institute, there have been several efforts introduced at departmental and school levels to address URM and women faculty recruitment, graduate student recruitment and pipeline issues. Furthermore, efforts have appeared to address hiring, search and hidden bias issues as well, with a number of new programs or policies developed over the past few years. In this section, we highlight a few examples of these efforts, many of which represent both known and new approaches to increase the pool of diverse candidates in hiring. Many of these efforts represent models or concepts that are indicated as Institute-wide mandates or goals in the recommendations. This short list is not intended to be exhaustive; there are numerous programs that exist across the Institute that also provide useful examples of ways in which diversity can be addressed. It is an intent of this study to initiate further discussion and sharing of such programs across the Institute, including both success stories and lessons learned from less successful attempts as a means of informing new efforts launched. Finally, it is important to emphasize that there are many examples of wonderful ideas and efforts that have been carried out on the campuses of other research-intensive universities. It is important to learn from these examples and determine which aspects of models set forth by peer institutions can be adapted to MIT. A few examples are provided here, but the list is not meant to be exhaustive, merely representative of the successful models embraced by our peer schools.
Examples from MIT
MIT Pappalardo Fellowships in Physics
The Pappalardo Fellows Program in Physics is highlighted here as a model that worked for increasing numbers of women faculty at MIT. For certain fields and disciplines, it is thought that similar models may be effective in increasing URM faculty candidates and hires. The mission of the MIT Pappalardo Fellowships in Physics is to sustain a distinguished, on-campus postdoctoral fellowship program for the department that identifies, recruits and supports the most talented and promising young physicists at an early stage of their careers. This initiative was made possible by the generosity of Mr. A. Neil Pappalardo (EE '64), an MIT alumnus with a long history of generosity to both the Institute and the Department of Physics. The program traditionally appoints three new fellows per academic year, each for a three-year fellowship term. Fellows are selected by means of an annual competition; candidates cannot apply directly, but must be nominated by a faculty member or senior researcher within the international community of physics, astronomy or related fields.
All MIT Pappalardo Fellows in Physics are provided with the following:
Independence in selection and focus of research direction within the MIT Department of Physics throughout their three-year fellowship term;
Active faculty mentoring fostered by weekly luncheons and monthly dinners with faculty and guests during the academic year, which promotes scientific exchange and professional growth for the fellows;
A competitive annual stipend with an annual cost-of-living increase (currently $60K for first-year fellows), combined with $5K per year in discretionary research funds; and
MIT Medical health insurance coverage for fellows and their dependents.
The outreach to the physics community for the program is large, with a rigorous selection process that engages faculty in the evaluation of fellows. Beginning each July, more than 1,300 physics (and related fields) faculty are emailed a solicitation for nominations of their top candidates for that fall's fellowship competition. Approximately 135 to 150 nominations are received each year. The review, evaluation and selection process begins with a thorough reading and grading of applicant materials (CV, publications list, research essay, three reference letters) by a minimum of two faculty members (typically both an experimentalist and a theorist in the candidate's area of physics). A short list of approximately 18 finalists is selected by committee consensus in mid-November. Over a two-day period in mid-December, the finalists meet for one half-hour each in a panel-style interview with the committee (15-20 minute ""blackboard"" talk by the finalist, with 10-15 minutes of Q & A with the faculty). At the end of this two-day interview period, the committee ranks all finalists, designating by consensus the top three to receive ""first-round"" offers, followed by five to six alternates, with the remaining half designated as not yet at that stage of career development that would allow them to benefit from an independent postdoctoral position such as the Pappalardo Fellowships.
Results of the MIT Pappalardo Fellowships Program indicate that from its inception year in 2000 to 2009, two of the five Pappalardo Fellows appointed to the MIT physics faculty are women (Gabriella Sciolla and Jocelyn Monroe). A total of 10 of the overall 34 Pappalardo Fellows during this same time period have been women (17 of 60 fellowship offers made were to women finalists), and 37 of 171 fellowship finalists invited to interview were women. It is also noted that each year since its inception, the Pappalardo Fellowships Executive Committee membership included one to two women faculty.
Biology URM Student Outreach Programs
In the recent past, the Department of Biology has made intentional and focused efforts to address graduate student enrollment and, in particular, graduate student diversity. The determination of the faculty to address this problem and implement substantive change was additionally fueled by concerns expressed by the National Institutes of Health and related NIH training grants operated by the department. Several faculty members were committed to changing diversity numbers at the graduate student level, which will ultimately improve the pipeline for faculty hires. This progress has been facilitated in part by the hiring of a full-time staff person, Mandana Sassanfar, who has coordinated many of the department's new outreach programs and efforts. Thus, over the last five years, the Department of Biology has made great strides in increasing the diversity of the population by recruiting URM graduate students to its program. In this time period, the fraction of students who are underrepresented minorities has almost tripled, with a steady increase from 5.2% in 2004 to 14.4% in 2009.
A variety of positive and focused outreach activities have synergistically come together to contribute to this success. These activities include: 1) faculty participation in the major national conferences for minority scientists and undergraduate students, including the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) and Society Advancing Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS); 2) faculty visits to colleges and universities with a large URM population. This establishes regular and direct contacts with directors of programs that aim to increase URM and underprivileged students' access to scientific research careers, e.g. Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC), Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS), the Meyerhoff Scholars Program at University of Maryland and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); 3) providing summer research opportunities to URM and underprivileged students at MIT (co-administered with the Science and Engineering-supported MIT Summer Research Program, or MSRP); 4) providing coordinated or individualized campus visits to MIT for URM and underprivileged students interested in graduate school in the biological sciences; and 5) providing opportunities for faculty from primarily URM-serving institutions to perform sabbatical research or to visit and present their research at MIT. These activities have contributed to success in recruiting outstanding minority students to the Biology program, not only by making direct contact with the students themselves, but also by providing opportunities for the Department of Biology to establish significant relationships with key faculty who mentor minority and disadvantaged students.
Future Faculty Workshop - Cross-disciplinary Materials Workshop
To address the need for increased diversity among faculty working in the areas of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (as it relates to Polymer Science and Materials Science), Department Chair and Professor of Chemistry Tim Swager teamed with colleagues at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, to create a workshop to train URM students and scholars in these fields. The workshop, designed to help prepare URMs for a faculty career, was a cross-disciplinary effort with the departments of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, and involved similar departments at the partner schools. The co-founder of the program is Prof. Richard McCullough, vice president for research and professor of chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University. This pilot workshop was held for the first time from June 15 to 17, 2008, at MIT's Endicott House. The second workshop was held in Pittsburgh, PA, at Carnegie Mellon from August 8 to 11, 2009, and a third one is being planned at the University of Massachusetts campus for 2010 or 2011.
The three-day workshop seeks to provide mentorship to aspiring underrepresented minority students with ambitions to become independent academic researchers in the areas of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science as they relate to Polymer Science, Materials Chemistry and Physics, Nanoscience, and Supramolecular Science. A diverse set of professors from varying ethnic backgrounds and stages of their careers participated as speakers and mentors, with a student/ faculty ratio of less than four maintained. Prominent faculty from each of the institutions involved participated in the program, giving lectures that included topics on research perspectives and practical issues, how to prepare a strong research plan for a faculty application, and how to find a good postdoctoral position. The agenda also included informal networking mixers, talks and panel discussions on preparing for the ""Path to Professorship"" by creating a strong experience in graduate school, developing research interests (creating a unique identity), choosing and cultivating mentors, developing strong references, sharing personal experiences in job interviews, the job application process, the job interview, writing research proposals, intellectual property issues and pitfalls, and unwritten rules. There were break-out sessions with mentors to work with students and postdocs on proposal development, and specific panels on running a research group and negotiations with department heads and deans. The technical research talks were presented by faculty in the evening sessions. Funding for the workshop was provided by the MIT departments of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Massachusetts, Amherst; Dow Chemical Co.; and the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (ACS-PRF).
Position of Manager of Diversity Recruitment for the School of Architecture and Planning
The hiring of a person who can focus on increasing the pipeline, the formation of networks and issues such as climate can be essential to advance diversity efforts on the department or school level. To this end, the dean of the School of Architecture and Planning has hired a manager of diversity recruitment (MDR), the only school-level position of its kind at MIT. The current person hired for this position is Dr. Robbin Chapman, a URM woman who earned her Ph.D. at MIT and is thus well acquainted with the Institute and its unique culture. The MDR supports faculty search committees within the school's units by assisting with outreach and the development of candidate pools; providing diversity training as requested; updating the school's faculty search handbook on diversity issues; and facilitating interaction between search committee chairs and the school's Faculty Diversity Committee. The MDR also assists with recruiting graduate students, via attendance at relevant conferences and engagement of faculty to do the same, and by serving as a point person for visiting URM prospective students. She facilitated the school's inaugural participation in the MITES program in 2009 and is a member of all SA&P department and school-level diversity committees.
The MDR convenes monthly diversity roundtable dialogues, which address a range of diversity and inclusion issues. The discussions provide practice in cross-cultural communication. The MDR has also championed diversity snapshots of a broad variety of SA+P faculty, staff and students, to help viewers challenge their assumptions about individuals based on what can be seen. Each snapshot includes a photographic image and three lists, titled: ""Some things you can see about me,"" ""What you may guess about me,"" and ""What you can't tell by looking at me."" These snapshots - displayed on flat-panel screens in the school's corridors and common spaces - have received a good deal of positive response from students and faculty alike as a means of introducing members of the school's community while celebrating its diversity. Finally, the MDR office has led an open-to-the-Institute series of diversity workshops over MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP). In sum, the MDR position appears to be a good use of resources, in large part because the current holder was an excellent fit for the appointment. More information is available at http://sap.mit.edu/about/diversity/.
Chemical Engineering Department ACCESS Program
For the first time in fall 2009, the Department of Chemical Engineering decided to launch a program directed toward potential graduate student candidates entitled ""A Community in Chemical Engineering Select Symposium,"" or ACCESS. The program, initiated by Department Head Klavs Jensen, was in direct response to suggestions and recommendations derived from the visit by the Chemical Engineering 2009 Visiting Committee (VC). Among the recommendations, one proposed by a member of the MIT Corporation was to develop a program that directly engages a broader pool of diverse applicants to the department via outreach. In separate discussions, another VC member, who is chief executive at Dow Chemical Company, offered to fund such a program. The symposium was organized by the department's student office and headed by Student Administrator Suzanne Easterly and her staff, with support from the Graduate Admissions Chair, Professor Arup Chakraborty.
The ACCESS program is a three-day visit to MIT that provides URM undergraduate students (juniors and seniors) with an overview of the potential benefits of a graduate chemical engineering degree. In addition to the educational and research opportunities inherent in graduate studies, the program gives details on the MIT community and available support for minority students. During their visit, participants also receive a glimpse of graduate student life in the Boston area. The first ACCESS symposium, held in late October, engaged 17 students from diverse backgrounds, including a dominant number of URMs. All received one-on-one discussions with faculty members in research areas of interest to them, research lectures from prominent faculty members, workshops on the chemical engineering graduate school application process, and discussions about graduate opportunities at MIT and beyond. Only an undergraduate student nominated by his or her current school's department head can apply to attend ACCESS. Faculty at the peer U.S. institutions in Chemical Engineering, as well as historically Black colleges & universities/minority institutions (HBCU/MIs), are contacted about the program, and nominations are solicited and advertised broadly. Early reports from this program indicate that several students were excited about the prospect of applying to MIT. Finally, all received significant information regarding the admission requirements that can help them shape their undergraduate background to increase the possibility of admittance to MIT and other top schools in the field.
SHASS - Search Oversight and Departmental Lecture Series 
SHASS leadership (Dean Fitzgerald and three predecessors) has exercised joint faculty and administrative oversight of all search and hiring requests from each department at the school level. A committee consisting of the dean, associate deans, director of human resources, and an equal number of faculty from various departments reviewed each ""Request to Search"" and ""Request to Hire"" to assure the use of best practices, and to serve as a backstop even when the department designated its own minority interests representative on a search committee. The joint committee has visited departments to speak with the full faculty, search committee and/or department head prior to planned searches in order to discuss best practices and to answer questions. 
The deans have encouraged department heads and committed individual faculty members to make creative use of Institute Target of Opportunity guidelines. In addition, they have offered funds to support a departmental lecture series to enable colleagues to meet and scrutinize potential candidates among their cohort before a formal search. Within the last five years, the dean has challenged each SHASS unit to present the names of senior minority scholars in their fields who could be tenured at MIT. From these lists, efforts to recruit and hire were made with one yield. The department heads have used Targets of Opportunity within a search to add a previously unanticipated talent or dimension of the field and, since 1995, at least 13 URM scholars have been added to SHASS in departments such as Music and Theater Arts, Linguistics and Philosophy, Writing and Humanistic Studies, Anthropology, History, Literature, and Science, Technology and Society. Six are now tenured professors. Of these six, one was hired as the result of a discipline-based lecture series funded by the dean's office. 
Hidden Bias Discussions in the School of Science
During the 2008-2009 academic year, the School of Science (SoS) Dean's Office sponsored discussions concerning ""hidden bias"" for faculty in each SoS department. Discussions were organized and led by two highly qualified MIT faculty members, Professor Sally Haslanger (philosophy) and Prof. Thomas DeFrantz (theater arts, women's and gender studies). Attendance was strongly encouraged and monitored. These sessions appeared to facilitate conversations about concepts surrounding bias (""schemas"") and opened the way for further consideration of bias present in a department that may impact recruitment and retention. Previous hidden bias seminars had been presented in 2007 at MIT Sloan by Associate Dean JoAnne Yates and Barbara Liskov. The material used for the more recent discussions was adapted from materials utilized by the STRIDE program at Michigan (see below).
Each department advertised the discussion to its faculty members, including the following text: ""The upcoming discussion concerning 'Overcoming Hidden Bias,' sponsored by the dean's office, comprises a forum to address hidden gender and racial bias. The interesting notion of 'schemas' - unconscious expectations that govern our interactions - will specifically be explored. We hope that these discussions will be a productive way to help faculty identify hidden bias, especially during recruitment and retention.""
School of Engineering - Central Coordination of Search Committees
When the School of Engineering administration informally surveyed search committees after the completion of searches, it was found that women and URM candidates were sometimes not selected because of a lack of fit rather than a lack of qualifications. In such cases, the candidate was highly qualified, but the research area did not appear to meet the more specific needs of the department. The dean's office responded to this observation by adapting the flexibility of hires as well as the opportunity for excellent top candidates to be hired in an appropriate unit within the school. This approach has contributed to the hiring of five URM faculty and 10 women in the past two recruiting years. One of several key means of accomplishing this flexibility is the formation of a Faculty Search Committee in the school. For the past two years, every search goes through a central coordination with Associate Dean Cindy Barnhardt. Barnhardt chairs the Faculty Search Diversity Committee, the members of which are the search chairs of each department. This committee meets every three to four weeks during the recruiting season (from November through May) to discuss information about specific candidates, in part because some applicants apply for more than one department. Before interviews begin, interview lists are sent to Barnhardt along with lists of eliminated women and minorities. At the meeting, the reasons for elimination of these candidates are discussed, and if the candidate is not a good fit for a given department, there is the opportunity for another department in a related field to consider the candidate. Such opportunities are not unusual, as research in the engineering fields has become more and more interdisciplinary. By utilizing this system of coordination, a candidate who is highly qualified has a greater chance of being considered and ultimately hired by one of the engineering departments.
MIT Sloan - Cluster Hiring 
For some time the MIT Sloan School of Management had tried to hire a senior woman for a Target of Opportunity (TOO) slot, but without success. In fact, MIT Sloan was the only school that had not made such an appointment, which ultimately led the deputy dean - concerned about diversity hiring - to authorize certain slots as TOO only, particularly to groups whose case for a slot was less strong. Certain groups who only had a TOO slot were then much more active in looking for candidates and did indeed make offers to senior women. The ability to use cluster hiring - hiring in larger groups and a range of different areas - enables greater inclusion of people from diverse groups, including women and URMs. In addition, the combination of broader cluster hires with some TOO restrictions can lead to increased diversity in hiring. In recruitment for the 2009-2010 year, MIT Sloan authorized 21 positions of which eight were specifically designated as TOO. MIT Sloan made 30 offers for the 21 slots, as some of the top candidates turned down offers in favor of other opportunities.
The distribution of the offers is as follows:
2 senior male minority
1 junior female minority
5 senior White women
4 junior White women
18 others, all male
The final roster of 14 new faculty consists of the following:
1 senior male minority
1 junior female minority
2 senior White women
3 junior White women
7 others, all male
The provost gave Sloan two TOO slots to cover these positions.
The distribution of the 21 ""first choice"" invitations is also very diverse:
2 senior male minority
1 junior female minority
5 senior White women
3 junior White women
10 others, all male
Experimental data have shown that selecting 10 candidates from a pool at one time leads to a more diverse group than selecting 10 people one at a time from the same pool. This is behind the recommendation for cluster hiring, which has a secondary advantage of creating a cohort of newcomers, which can be particularly helpful for all junior faculty.
MIT Summer Research Program
Since its first summer in 1986, MSRP has tirelessly worked to increase the pool of minority students who pursue graduate degrees. During this time, MSRP has seen more than 90% of program participants pursue advanced degrees. With a goal of encouraging and preparing students to pursue graduate degrees at an institution of higher learning (not specifically at MIT), MIT was able to capture 17% of the 400 program participants.
A faculty committee, commissioned in 2004 by then-Provost Robert Brown, was charged with redesigning MSRP as MIT's premier recruitment tool for underrepresented minority students. Since then, the committee has continued to serve as an advisory board for MSRP. Working with this committee, chaired by Professor Paula Hammond of the Department of Chemical Engineering, Christopher Jones (assistant dean for graduate education) has continued to implement important changes in the program. During its redesign, MSRP articulated its mission: ""To promote the value of graduate education, to improve the research enterprise through increased diversity, and to prepare and recruit the best and brightest for graduate education at MIT."" As a direct result of the redesign, there has been an increase in the number of MSRP participants who apply to, are admitted and ultimately decide to enroll in MIT's graduate programs.
Since the expansion of MSRP in 2005, more departments and programs throughout the Institute have become active participants, and the 2009 class included interns who worked in urban studies and mathematics. Not only have each of the five MIT schools agreed to a five-year commitment to fund a number of the interns, but several faculty members have added MSRP to their research grants providing funding for individual interns. MSRP continues to build lasting relationships within the MIT and broader Boston communities. To further engage the departments, MSRP continues formal visits with graduate officers, graduate administrators and current students in the departments in which MSRP interns have expressed an interest.
Key to the success of MSRP is faculty participation. Since 1986, more than 150 faculty members from a range of Institute departments have served as direct mentors to more than 500 MSRP interns. Faculty involvement includes program design, intern selection and matching interns with projects and academic interactions. MSRP continues to have a significant academic component in which faculty conduct weekly lunch seminars on their research.
Finally, MSRP continues to be successful at engaging alumni of the program who currently attend MIT as graduate students, hosting several events and dinners to bring this group together while also providing resources for their success.
Peer Institution Examples
University of Michigan STRIDE (Science and Technology Recruiting to Improve Diversity and Excellence)
This program was established under the University of Michigan's NSF ADVANCE program with the leadership of ADVANCE's PI, a social scientist familiar with the gender field. The design was based on and further adapted from Harvard University's Committee on Faculty Diversity. The initial committee was recruited by the deans of three colleges in the science and engineering fields and consisted of a group of highly respected senior faculty who were given resources for course release or research support. STRIDE was led by social scientist and Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies Abigail Stewart, who was provided with staff support. The STRIDE committee members, consisting of a majority of men, were actually new to the PI and to each other. They spent a summer reviewing research literature on gender schemas and evaluation bias, discussed it with the PI, and ultimately produced a PowerPoint presentation along with a 27-page recruiting handbook. They then met with departments, department heads, recruiting committees, and anyone else interested to give their presentations and lead discussions. The handbook was widely distributed by the deans. During the first year of their efforts, the recruitment of women scientists doubled from 15% to 31%. In later years, they began to recruit other faculty allies into a new group called FASTER (Friends and Allies of Science and Technology Equity in Recruiting) and taught the new members what they had learned. Today, many universities, including MIT, have based their own presentations on STRIDE. The University of Michigan is now supporting the program since their NSF funding has ended. http://sitemaker.umich.edu/advance/stride.
Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-Ph.D. Bridge Program
This program emerged from two facts about the trajectories of minority students to the doctorate in science. First, the 10 top producers of African American baccalaureates in physics are HBCUs. Second, the trajectory of minority students to move toward a doctorate is more likely to be via a master's degree in a different institution, hence creating complicated transition issues not typically found with non-minority students. The Bridge Program that emerged is based on applications to Fisk for a master's degree in physics. After successful completion of that degree, including a master's thesis, students can apply to Vanderbilt Ph.D. programs in physics, astronomy, materials, biology and the biomedical sciences. These students are not promised admission to the Vanderbilt Ph.D. program and, like other candidates, have to meet the standard requirements. What they are offered, however, is the following: the opportunity to take courses at Vanderbilt during their time at Fisk; the provision of a Vanderbilt advisor as well as a Fisk advisor; help in preparation for the GREs; and an invitation to participate in programs such as Preparing Future Faculty.
At the time of application to Fisk, students are asked if they want to be considered for the Bridge Program. The application goes through the standard Fisk admissions process and then proceeds to the Bridge committee, consisting of relevant faculty from both institutions and including the Vanderbilt graduate admissions person. Criteria for admission to the Bridge Program are not proven ability but unrealized potential, which is gauged by personal visits with faculty at baccalaureate schools, heavy marketing, and attendance at minority association meetings and conferences. The program, therefore, is meant to increase the pool of minority Ph.D.s, rather than fight for those who already meet the accepted criteria of admission to top programs. It has had the secondary effect of increasing applications to Vanderbilt science doctoral programs from minority students who do meet the usual criteria.
During the Bridge years, students take courses at Fisk and at Vanderbilt, including at least one core Ph.D. course at Vanderbilt. They have advisors from both schools and have research experiences with faculties at both. Their Vanderbilt advisor serves as a mentor on the Vanderbilt Ph.D. application and admission process and is specifically geared to being an advocate for the student during this time. This one-to-one relationship between the Fisk student and the Vanderbilt mentor is the core of the program. In addition, full financial support is provided during the Bridge years and during the Ph.D. program, if the person is accepted. To date, the success rate of acceptance to Vanderbilt is 97% and they attribute their failures to the program, rather than to the student. They have actually modified the program on the basis of some of these failures and are beginning to send a few of their students to other Ph.D. programs, including one at Yale.
Meyerhoff Scholars Program at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)
This program started in 1988 with a grant from Robert and Jane Meyerhoff to provide financial aid, mentoring, advising and research experience to young African American male undergraduates committed to getting Ph.D.s in STEM fields. In 1990 women were admitted to the program, and in 1996 it was opened to people from all backgrounds who were ""committed to increasing the representation of minorities in science and engineering.""

•	The Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives, the ADAPP-ADVANCE (National Science Foundation grant number 0811205) program, and the Office of the Vice President of Academic Human Resources (AHR) have developed and implemented the “Advancing Faculty Success” toolkits, designed to advance MSU’s values of quality and inclusiveness in faculty hiring, promotion and retention.  Guidance provided in the toolkits supplements, but does not replace, MSU policies and procedures for faculty and staff, including the MSU Academic Hiring Manual, Faculty Handbook, and Support Staff Employee Handbook.  The Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives and AHR have disseminated “Advancing Faculty Success” toolkits university-wide since 2012 in a series of best practices booklets which are available on MSU’s ADAPP-ADVANCE website: http://www.adapp-advance.msu.edu/about.  

•	The Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives provides regular training for faculty members to implement the ADAPP initiative by applying guiding principles to faculty search procedures.  The ADAPP “Faculty Search Toolkit,” used in the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives faculty training sessions, delineates strategies for a successful faculty search at each stage of the faculty hiring process.  It integrates required search procedures provided in the Academic Hiring Manual with recommended best practices for diversity and institutional equity.

•	The “Faculty Search Toolkit” advises departments to establish a diverse search committee and ensure that search committee members understand the purpose of the search, the general search process, and their respective roles.   Academic Hiring Procedures require the Chairperson to conduct an affirmative action session with the search committee.  The session focuses on the university’s commitment to affirmative action and equal opportunity, and to a fair, legal, and effective recruitment process which advances diversity and excellence in the academic workforce. 

•	Academic Hiring Procedures require that an Affirmative Action Advocate be appointed to serve on each search committee.  This member evaluates the search on an ongoing basis in terms of the goals and principles of affirmative action, equal opportunity, nondiscrimination and diversity and brings deficiencies to the attention of the search committee (or as necessary to the attention of the Chairperson or the Director of the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives) for corrective action.

•	Search committee guidance provides for the development of a thoughtful recruiting plan that proactively seeks to promote a diverse applicant pool.   Search committees must complete the Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment Activities Form and the Academic Position Request, which must be approved before recruiting begins,   the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives may require additional efforts to promote a diverse applicant pool. 

•	Academic Hiring Procedures require that search committees advertise positions and conduct other recruitment activities specified on the Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment Activities Form. All academic vacancies must be posted locally.  Tenure system and other continuing appointment system positions must be advertised nationally.

•	Academic Hiring Procedures require that the application deadline date for all postings be at least two weeks after the posting date, but preferably longer.  

•	The Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives reviews recruitment plans for all academic searches as required in the Academic Hiring Procedures.  Each search plan is reviewed to see that it includes mechanisms likely to reach protected class members.  If efforts appear inadequate, the Office recommends additional or alternative strategies.

•	All academic vacancies must be posted locally.  Tenure system and other continuing appointment system positions must be advertised nationally or within the geographical area customary for the appointment.

•	Search committees are instructed to seek out qualified minority and women applicants through professional organizations and personal contacts.  

•	Academic job announcements are routinely sent to colleges and universities with predominantly minority and women populations.",http://www.adapp-advance.msu.edu/,--

(1) Faculty Recruitment and Development working group: 
The Office of Diversity and Inclusion has a working group dedicated to faculty recruitment and development.  The current goals of this group are to continue training sessions for search committee chairs and members, host an annual workshop (The Future Faculty Workshop) for under-represented postdoctoral scholars and late stage PhD students, partner with Northeastern University to update, upgrade and expand Rice’s National Database of Under-Represented Postdoctoral Scholars and Late State PhD students, and to host lunch discussions for under-represented Rice faculty.  During the 2012-2013 academic year, the Faculty Recruitment and Development working group met all four of these goals. 

(2) Rice University’s NSF ADVANCE: 
“The Rice University NSF ADVANCE Institutional Transformation for Faculty Diversity project is committed to increasing the number of women in science and engineering at Rice University, with a particular focus on the Schools of Natural Science and Engineering.  The program is designed to capitalize on the strong commitment to gender equity at Rice University, and to create new insights into the features of the academy that impede the inclusion and progress of women and minorities more generally in the professoriate.  The hope of the program is that more women and underrepresented minorities will be inspired to join the ranks of academe and to use their own skills to advance into important leadership roles based on the activities of this program.”

The alums met with undergraduate and graduate students, senior university leadership and members of the cultural and ethnic community at Stanford, including the Black Community Services Center, El Centro Chicano, the Native American Cultural Center, and the Asian American Activities Center, which all hosted receptions for their alums.  DAS is a collaboration between the Office of the  Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, Vice Provost for Graduate Education, Vice Provost for Student Affairs and the Stanford Alumni Association.  

The Distinguished Alumni Scholars Day was established in 2006 as an institutional response to the scarce presence of diverse racial/ethnic group members within the faculty ranks of our nation’s colleges and universities, and within the Ph.D. programs that produce these faculty. The purpose of this now biennial program is to bring Stanford students from cultural groups underrepresented in academia into contact and discussion with distinguished alumni scholars from a broad range of backgrounds, disciplines, and institutional types to inspire new generations of students to consider academia as a career.

The Clare Boothe Luce Program encourages and supports women seeking to study or teach science, engineering, and mathematics. The CBL Program makes grants to 4-year degree granting institutions that demonstrate a strong commitment to support of women in STEM, to award scholarships to women students to cover the final two years of their undergraduate studies. CBL scholarship recipients are encouraged to participate in undergraduate research in order to motive them to pursue graduate studies. Stevens Institute of Technology is a 3-time recipient of the Clare Boothe Luce (CBL) Program grant over the last 12 years, which has been used to award scholarships to 7 women undergraduate students.

Stevens also offers a graduate fellowship from the New Jersey Alliance for Engineering Education, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) GK-12 program, to create partnerships with local NJ high school science departments to promote the integration of problem solving, innovation, and inventiveness within the STEM curricula. This program provides funding to graduate students in STEM disciplines to develop enhanced teaching and communication skills by working in high school classrooms for up to 10 hours per week.

The Robert Crooks Stanley Fellowship is a Graduate teaching fellowship in Engineering and Science for students pursuing a doctorate or master’s degree and maintaining a 3.5 grade point average. Although the fellowship is open to all Stevens graduate students, women applicants are targeted and strongly encouraged to apply.

Stevens Technical Enrichment Program (STEP), a program to support and assist students from underrepresented backgrounds to achieve their academic, personal and career goals, runs two summer programs each year taught by graduate students.

More than 90% of GEM Fellows complete their degree and go on to careers in industry and higher education, including professorships at Member Universities. http://www.gemfellowship.org/universities/gem-membership/ 
Tufts University's Center for STEM Diversity works in partnership with the School of Engineering and the School of Arts and Sciences to foster a diverse and inclusive science and engineering learning environment. The center helps coordinate all of the efforts in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields and serves as an umbrella organization for the various diversity programs and clubs on campus. 

The Center for STEM Diversity has created a number of programs to help retain a diverse STEM student body including Bridge to Engineering Success at Tufts (BEST), STEM Ambassadors, and Promoting Retention in Science in Engineering (PRISE). The center also works with established programs that have been successfully keeping underrepresented students involved in the sciences and engineering such as Leadership Alliance and science and engineering professional societies. The Center for STEM Diversity hosts a series of workshops and seminars throughout the year to cultivate success around research and internships in our diverse community. 

The center also offers support programs for graduate programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and the center joins with faculty and staff throughout the university to develop and facilitate academic and career-oriented programs that cater to the unique needs of Tufts science and engineering graduate students. 
",http://stemdiversity.tufts.edu/,"Tufts belongs to the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (NE-HERC). This consortium of universities provides a website for posting faculty and staff positions and information about resources; convenes semi-annual meetings for member institutions that provide information and opportunities for networking; and emphasizes recruiting a diverse workforce.

CELT, mentioned in PA-4, runs a junior faculty mentoring program that helps junior faculty develop a network of mentors to help them find success as researchers, scholars, teachers, and family members. This is particularly, but not exclusively, targeted to faculty from under-represented groups.

In addition to these university-wide programs, each school takes measures to ensure that faculty searches yield diverse candidate pools and hires.

In addition, the CDO is convening a subgroup of the Diversity & Inclusion Working Group (DIWG) that will focus on recruitment, retention, and success strategies for all campus constituencies, including faculty, staff, and students.

One of the ways in which the university pursues a more diverse faculty is by providing teaching fellowships, mentoring, and financial assistance to underrepresented groups of students enrolling in terminal degree programs. UB offers the Arthur A. Schomburg Fellowship Program (http://grad.buffalo.edu/FinancialSupport/Scholarships_Fellowships/ schomburg .html) for students in doctoral and master’s level programs across the university who contribute to the diversity of the campus. The university also participates in the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program (http://cpmc.buffalo.edu/mcnair/index.php)   which serves to encourage underrepresented groups to pursue doctoral study. In order to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields, UB offers several programs that provide financial support, mentoring, and academic and career preparation:  
-Bridge to the Doctorate program (http://bridgetodoc.buffalo.edu/)
-Scholarships in Science, Technology, and Math (S-STEM) (http://mceer.buffalo.edu/infoservice/Education/UBSSTEMFlyer.pdf), and 
-The Institute for Strategic Enhancement of Educational Diversity Graduate Scholars (iSEED) (http://www.buffalo.edu/iseed/phd-students/iseed-graduate-scholars-program.html). 

In an effort to diversify the university community, the provost makes available subsidies to departments that identify and hire faculty members from underrepresented minority groups, particularly when candidates become available outside of the formal faculty recruitment cycle. For example, two African American entry-level social work scholars were recruited and hired after the formal recruitment cycle with the assistance of a subsidy from the provost. These individuals will begin in the fall of 2015.

It is designed to encourage students from groups often underrepresented in graduate programs to pursue doctoral degrees. The program serves first-generation college students from low-income families and students from populations underrepresented in graduate education. Students who participate in the McNair Scholars Program receive benefits such as academic, career, and personal counseling, mentoring by faculty, preparation for the GRE, assistance in applying to graduate school, paid travel to professional and research conferences, training in research methodology, and a summer research internship with a research stipend of up to $2,800.  About 20 UC Davis undergraduates and incoming transfer students are selected each year to participate in academic year and summer activities.

UC LEADS (Leadership Excellence Through Advanced Degrees) is a two-year program designed to identify educationally or economically disadvantaged undergraduates in science, mathematics or engineering who show promise of succeeding in doctoral degree programs. The program provides students with educational experiences that prepare them to assume positions of leadership in industry, government, public service, and academia. Additional benefits include: research experience, research stipends, GRE preparation, seminars and advising, and travel to professional meetings.


While the following two programs are open to all students/postdocs, we intentionally encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to participate in the following:
 
- Professors for the Future: Professors for the Future (PFTF) is a year-long competitive fellowship program designed to recognize and develop the leadership skills of outstanding graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who have demonstrated their commitment to professionalism, integrity, and academic service. This unique program sponsored by Graduate Studies focuses on the future challenges of graduate education, postdoctoral training, and the academy. Professors for the Future is designed to prepare UC Davis doctoral students and postdoctoral scholars for an increasingly competitive marketplace and a rapidly changing university environment. PFTF Fellows receive a $3,000 stipend. (gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/pftf)
 
- GradPathways: GradPathways is a premier professional development program that builds on the successes of our previous Professional Development Series, a nationally recognized program that has served thousands of UC Davis graduate students and postdoctoral scholars since its inception in 2004. Recent reports by the Council of Graduate Schools and the UC Davis Special Task Force on Graduate Education demonstrated the need to do more to ensure success in graduate school and future career endeavors. GradPathways helps to answer that need. (gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/gradpathways)
 
- Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program: The UC Davis Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program offers postdoctoral research fellowships, faculty mentoring, and eligibility for the UC-system hiring incentive to outstanding scholars in all fields whose research, teaching, and service will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity at the University of California. (academicaffairs.ucdavis.edu/programs/cpf.htm)


The UC Davis ADVANCE program seeks to facilitate the adoption of the best-practices for conducting fair, equitable, and successful search faculty searches by collecting and disseminating best-practice information and resources. Research shows that search committees succeed in hiring qualified women and people of color when they are proactive and consciously committed to building a diverse applicant pool and engaging in equitable review processes. UC Davis ADVANCE encourages departments and colleges to use the resources on their Recruitment and Diversity webpage to inform their faculty search and recruitment processes.  

UC Davis ADVANCE partnered with a graduate student organizers to support a Women in Leadership series last Fall 2013 that was primarily focused on graduate students and gender equity in the workplace (ucd-advance.ucdavis.edu/event/women-leadership-panel-session). ADVANCE is also piloting a program to mentor new faculty as they transition to faculty positions at UC Davis.

The Program The University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program was established in 1984 to encourage outstanding women and minority Ph.D. recipients to pursue academic careers at the University of California. The current program offers postdoctoral research fellowships, faculty mentoring, and eligibility for a hiring incentive to outstanding scholars in all fields whose research, teaching, and service will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity at the University of California.

Contributions to Diversity and Equal Opportunity 
These contributions may include public service addressing the needs of our increasingly diverse society, efforts to advance equitable access to higher education, or research focusing on underserved populations or understanding inequalities related to race, gender, disability or LGBT. The program is seeking applicants with the potential to bring to their academic careers the critical perspective that comes from their non-traditional educational background or understanding of the experiences of groups historically underrepresented in higher education.


Hiring &  Recruitment
All faculty hiring committees must have a person designated as the “Diversity Liaison”, who help ensure that fair hiring policies and best practices are followed throughout the search.  Fair hiring training is required for the search chair and the Diversity Liaison, and the full committee is invited to the training.  The search committee is provided information on writing job descriptions and advertisements to be inclusive and to encourage applicants who can contribute to the diversity of the campus, and a statement of diversity is encouraged of all applicants.  Funding is provided for strategic advertising to build pool diversity, and committee members are instructed to perform a large amount of outreach to obtain a diverse pool.  The pool diversity is monitored at each stage of the search process, with an expectation of having similar demographics to the graduating PhDs in the field; if a pool has many fewer women than expected, the search can be suspended until additional outreach has been done to diversity the pool (this has happened on our campus).  The selection process is based on the advertised criteria, which include contributions to diversity in research, teaching, and service, per university policy.  All tenure/tenure-track faculty hiring must go through an open search unless a waiver is approved, and the three types of waivers are all designed to help improve diversity: Presidential Post-doc hiring (hiring of alumni from the UC systemwide post-doc program that awards post-docs to scholars contributing to diversity), Target of Excellence hires (one of the key criteria is contributions to diversity, in addition to outstanding achievement in the field), and Partner Hires (which have been found to be disproportionately important for female faculty).  Once here, development is assisted by our Mentoring Program for Faculty, as well as our Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program.  Ongoing salary and promotion review criteria explicitly includes contributions to diversity in research, teaching, and service.

Particular attention is given to (1) preparation of search committees, (2) recruitment & evaluation of large and diverse pools of applicants, and (3) faculty retention. See our Faculty Hiring page for these resources.
During campus interviews for faculty positions, some historically underrepresented candidates ask to speak directly with individuals with whom they share a particular aspect(s) of social identity (i.e., international status, sexual orientation, gender, race/ethnicity). They are interested in hearing underrepresented tenure-track and tenured faculty members' experiences on our campus as well as in the broader community.

In response, CME compiles a list of such faculty who are willing to talk with candidates who visit our campus. If you'd like to include your name on the list, contact Dr Mixon Mitchell (above). In addition to your name, we also need to know what aspects of your social identifications/perspectives you feel comfortable speaking from. (For example, Dr Mixon MitchelI feels comfortable discussing her experiences from the perspective of an African American female.)



Once a hire is complete, ongoing success is best achieved with a plan for connecting the new hire to important supports and resources needed for retention and advancement. Support is especially important during the first year of employment, and can include connecting new hires to campus communities such as these affinity groups that CME supports:

    Through regular meetings, resource sharing and networking, the Faculty of Color Association (FOCA) provides support for and by faculty and instructors from racial/ethnic minorities communities in support of DU's Inclusive Excellence Strategic Plan goals around compositional diversity, climate and public good engagement.
    The Queer Faculty Association (QFA) supports lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning-identified faculty on campus through advocacy, scholarship, and social networking.
    CME also supports the work of various DU Women's organizations , including the Faculty Women's Association.



CME staff are available for consultation and training on issues of diversity that arise in or in relation to the classroom and/or department, including, but not limited to:

    curriculum enrichment (e.g. infusing diversity into curriculum)
    co-curricular learning opportunities (e.g. linking with local community-based organizations and on-campus activities)
    intergroup conflict and cooperation
    diversity resources and referrals

These are consistent with its Diversity Strategic Thinking Document and Mosaic for UIC Transformation (Diversity Strategic Plan Document), many of which include faculty in implicit and explicit ways. UIC stands apart from many of its peers in that we house an independently collaborative Office for Diversity. This office partners with faculty and staff from administrative offices, colleges, and departments to deliver a number of programs and supports. In conjunction with the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, the Vice Provost and Senior Assistant to the Chancellor for Diversity convenes a Diversity Advisory Committee. Additionally, the Vice Provost and Senior Assistant to the Chancellor for Diversity convenes a Diversity Executive Committee that consists of Diversity Representatives for each of the line colleges on campus. With support from the Office for Diversity, the Chancellor’s office convenes six Chancellor’s Status Committees, each with faculty subcommittees. Faculty Diversity is also supported through the UIC Office for Access and Equity, which upholds related regulations and academic hiring policies and provides diversity-related resources, discrimination and harassment-related resources, and disability-related resources, all of which pertain to faculty. Additionally, the Vice Provosts support the Provost and Chancellor in administering the Underrepresented Faculty Recruitment Program, the Cluster Hiring Initiative, an annual meeting of Underrepresented faculty, and specialized mentoring workshops for junior underrepresented faculty that focus on the promotion and tenure process.  

The Underrepresented Faculty Recruitment Program helps increase the diversity of higher education faculty.  The aim of the Underrepresented Faculty Recruitment Program is to attract and retain a faculty that more closely resembles the UIC student population. The UFRP is designed to encourage and assist colleges and departments that have selected underrepresented candidates for hire by providing funds toward salary and research.  

The Diversity Strategic Plan and Mosaic for UIC Transformation promote the cumulative thinking of faculty, staff, and students toward diversity strategic thinking and planning. They contain existing and future goals and initiatives, reflected in the description of programs, policies, creative action committees, and current and future aspirations that support diversity.

The Diversity Advisory Committee and the Diversity Executive Committee both set goals, report on existing activities, and advise key administrators on the progress of campus towards its diversity strategic plan.

The Clustering Hiring Initiative is a  faculty recruitment program to increase diversity and the interdisciplinary culture of UIC. It was designed to cultivate diverse academic leadership and enhance the educational experience of students and the work of faculty by broadening the array of backgrounds, ideas, and disciplines of faculty on campus.

There are also six Chancellor's Status Committees, each of which has a faculty subcommittee that supports the diversity of faculty. Faculty are nominated by existing committee members to serve campus in ways that support faculty diversity, such as attending faculty mentoring and orientation events held in conjunction with the Office for Faculty Affairs.

The Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) is a nonprofit organization that aims to improve education in its 16 member states (including Kentucky). The University of Louisville is specifically involved with the SREB-Doctoral Scholars Program, which is committed to increasing faculty diversity. The Doctoral Scholars Program supports a nationwide initiative to produce more minority PhDs and encourages their pursuit of joining the professoriate. The program offers financial support and guidance for doctoral students throughout their studies.  

UofL participates in SREB’s annual Institute on Teaching and Mentoring, which is the largest gathering of minority doctoral scholars in the country. While at the Institute, doctoral students attend workshops designed to assist in their scholarship and prepare them for success as faculty members. UofL’s participants in the Institute have traditionally included students (SREB doctoral scholars), faculty mentors, and staff, who attend the Institute to recruit minority faculty.   

2. The Arts and Sciences Peer Mentoring Program supports small groups of junior faculty, many of which are faculty of color, who want to learn how to be productive scholars and effective teachers. These peer mentoring groups meet regularly to discuss with other junior faculty various topics, including how to be a productive scholar, time-management skills, syllabus design, teaching practice, or the formal and informal standards for success. 

3. Inclusive Teaching Circles are small cohorts of faculty who meet monthly to discuss how teaching can be made more inclusive of students of all social identities. Typically, such meetings focus on a reading concerning research on oppression, pedagogy, or best practices. The outcomes include more effective and inclusive teaching practices and the development of a community of practitioners who come together to share their experiences and knowledge.",http://louisville.edu/sustainability/finance-outreach/diversity-affordability.html#section-18,--

The SOE commitment to and appreciation of diversity is reflected in its coursework, community outreach efforts, work with local school systems, and research. This commitment is also reflected in the establishment of the Access and Equity Committee (AEC), which serves as a vehicle for faculty, staff, and students to advocate for diversity in the life of the School of Education. AEC specifically strives to do the following:
* Foster an inclusive climate that affirms the diversity of students, staff and faculty members by offering equal educational access and opportunity to all SOE community members.
* Educate the SOE community about critical issues pertaining to access, equity and diversity, and encourage the use of inclusive practices.
* Advocate for diversity in the life of the SOE community through educational programming, faculty and student recruitment and retention, and research development.
* Recognize outstanding work related to access, equity and diversity in research, teaching and/or service to the School of Education and/or the larger community.

Another program for potential future teachers is the ""UNCG Teach"" Learning Community, which provides students within the Pre-Education major a unique opportunity to explore the field of Education. Students enroll in specially designed courses focused on fostering strong educators for a global tomorrow. This learning community allows students to make friends, create study groups, experience collaborative learning, and network with faculty and professionals in the field.  Exploring Teaching As a Profession (ETAP) is an academic interest group part of the Grogan Residential College.

Within the SOE is the Department of Educational Leadership and Cultural Foundations (ELC). ELC is concerned with issues of educational theory, cultural analysis, educational leadership and school organization, educational policy, and curriculum studies. The department seeks to prepare thoughtful and effective leaders in education through programs of study that are interdisciplinary in focus and that emphasize questions of moral concern, the cultural context of education, and a reconstructive vision for excellent and equitable schooling.

Scholarships are available for typically underrepresented groups as well as those who are studying to teach special education.

The UNCG Teaching and Learning Commons has a mentoring component and research based agenda to assist new faculty members with transitioning to our campus, but to also help them understand and navigate the tenure track process needed to successfully attain tenure.

This contact must be more than written or verbal contact via e-mail, mail, or over the phone. This contact must be aggressive; faculty, staff, and administrators must visit institutions and organizations that would be our source of employees. We must invite representatives to our campus in order to promote the attractions of employment at UWSP. We must attend conferences and meetings that provide the opportunity to build relationships with colleagues across the country and internationally, so that when positions are available at UWSP, our campus and its surrounding community will be known as an attractive institution at which to build a career and location in which to establish a long-term residence.
