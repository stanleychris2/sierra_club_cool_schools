1) The university’s Tenured Faculty Diversity Initiative is designed to help build a diverse faculty. The initiative is housed within Academic Affairs and a committee, including representatives from the Office of Equity and Inclusion, consider proposals to fund tenure-track/tenured faculty hires.

2) The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (http://lsamp.oregonstate.edu/) includes goals to increase the number of students interested in and qualified for graduate-level studies. 

3) PROMISE is an annual, 10-week program that has been part of the Oregon State University community since 1992. PROMISE is a developmental internship program designed to provide professional, managerial, or technical paid work experience and mentoring in state and local government agencies for Oregon State University juniors and seniors. The program's purpose is to increase the potential pool of applicants currently underrepresented in state and local government agencies. Interested students from historically underrepresented backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply.

In addition, the program provides robust learning opportunities for the intern cohort. Attendance and participation are a crucial component of the overall experience and interns are required to attend scheduled events. It is expected that interns will emerge from the program ready to navigate the employment process, be well connected and be confident in the workplace.  http://oregonstate.edu/oei/promise ",http://oregonstate.edu/admin/aa/tenured-faculty-diversity-initiative,"Thanks to Jennifer M.
