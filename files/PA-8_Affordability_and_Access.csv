The staff in the Office of Financial Aid CSUF is committed to providing the student with the services and funds that are needed to achieve their educational goals. Our Mission is to remove the financial barriers to a student’s education so that the student may enroll and complete his/her degree objectives. As financial aid professionals, we provide opportunities to learn, we ensure access to higher education, we promote the student’s economic stability, and through our compliance with regulations, which govern the administration of financial aid programs, we ensure continuity in the delivery of state, federal, and institutional student aid funds to the University. Financial aid is available to remove the cost barriers that may prevent you from pursuing your educational goals. Assistance is available from a variety of programs funded by federal, state, university and private sources. Students who demonstrate significant financial need may qualify for grant aid while students with less need may obtain low cost loans. Financial need is determined through a federal formula that assesses the family’s relative financial strength and ability to contribute to meeting the student’s educational costs. 
There are 3 general categories of financial aid: Grants and scholarships; Loans; and Employment opportunities.
To receive financial aid from a CSU campus, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Eligibility for financial aid is the amount that remains after the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is subtracted from the cost of education. The cost of education is the amount the University estimates the student will spend to attend college for the academic year. The cost of education includes the basic State University Fee, various campus-based fees, room and board, books, supplies, transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses.

CSUF, through Titan Shops, provides course material savings to students in a variety of ways. Student savings are achieved with used, digital, buyback, and rental textbook programs. These programs lower the cost of course materials to students, with estimated annual savings of over $3M.  Students can take advantage of the Low Price Guarantee program that ensures they are receiving the best possible price on course materials. In addition, students can compare textbooks prices with other sources, using the Titan Shops on-line price comparison tool that is incorporated with their campus textbook list.   

Funded by the CSU, the Graduate Equity Program seeks to increase the diversity of students completing graduate degree programs, encourage further study in doctoral programs and promote consideration of university faculty careers. It provides fellowships to economically disadvantaged CSUF students who have overcome educational disadvantages or hardships.

For low income students who possess the academic and leadership attributes we value, these students will receive grants, employment opportunities and low interest student loans to enable them to enroll and remain enrolled.  We also have in place a practice that allows us to reevaluate students special financial circumstances annually, to make sure they have adequate financial resources to remain enrolled.  This ensures that those students who enroll as first year students, can persist to graduation.
",We do not have any programs for faculty and staff.  We provide extensive training to staff to help them serve families from all income and need levels.,,"While we do not have designated scholarship programs for low income students, we have financial aid policies and practices in place which provide the financial aid funding necessary to enable their enrollment and persistence.

Also, we seek to enroll students of the highest academic and artistic caliber in each of our six undergraduate colleges. We use our financial aid resources to enroll a class that reflects this goal.
","Carnegie Mellon’s financial assistance program is designed to meet our dual goal of helping prospective students who have demonstrated financial need afford the cost of education and rewarding those students who have outstanding talents and abilities.

As a result, we are using need as a factor to determine if students can be awarded additional financial aid from Chatham, which does not have to be repaid.

For five years, an admission counselor has been on the planning committee of a Pittsburgh-colleges initiative, College Success 101, which annually provides public school students in the region with information about financial aid and scholarships and other aspects of college life. Additionally, Chatham works with alumnae involved with two community based organizations (YWCA and SHINE) that serve young women in low-income areas of Pittsburgh by providing them with information about higher education opportunities. Chatham has established a partnership with the Youth and Arts sector of Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild, a local organization that serves students in the Pittsburgh public school region, many of whom are low-income students; Chatham provides an art scholarship and information about the college search process. Additionally, Chatham has established a partnership with a local Girl Scout troop that targets girls living in specific low-income housing projects in Western PA; faculty, staff and students are engaged with the troop to bring a host of services to the girls in that particular troop.

Without transportation to campus, overnight housing and food, many of these young women would not be able to visit our campus to engage with professors and experience campus life prior to making their college selection.     ","First-year student admission is for applicants entering directly from high school, without enrolling in prior post-secondary course work (other than courses completed while attending high school).

Admission to Chatham University is determined by the candidate’s academic record, her promise as a student at Chatham, and commitment to continued personal growth. Chatham gives preference to students that come from a strong college preparatory background. Chatham encourages a minimum of four years of English, three years of mathematics, three years of science, and three years of social science. The meeting of minimum requirements itself does not ensure admission to Chatham. Acceptance is contingent upon a candidate’s completion of secondary school requirements and is based on careful review of all credentials presented by the candidate.

First-year student applicants must submit the following:

    Completed application for admission
    Official high school transcripts
    SAT (Chatham code: 2081) or ACT (Chatham Code: 3538) scores
    Essay or writing sample
    One or more letters of recommendation from guidance counselor or teachers.

Students may apply using our SAT optional policy and choose not to submit their SAT scores at the time of application. If not submitting their scores, in additional to the required application materials, applicants must submit the following:

    Résumé
    Graded academic writing sample
    Complete an on campus interview (highly recommended)
    Portfolio (optional)

If an applicant feels that these materials do not adequately represent her academic abilities or explain her academic history, she is encouraged to submit additional explanatory materials to strengthen her application.

Further, prospective students are strongly encouraged to arrange for a personal tour of campus and meet with an Admission Counselor. The Office of Admission is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on selected Saturdays (prospective students should call ahead for the availability of Saturday visits).

","Colgate’s multicultural recruitment efforts include parent components at several stages of the process. While this audience is not exclusively low income, there are many first-generation students in this group for whom financing a private education is real mystery, and sacrifice. Our multicultural open house, held each fall, has an extensive parent component that includes a financial aid session and a session with Colgate administrators and faculty who are all invested in helping students make a successful transition to college. Additionally, we have had letter campaigns from parents of current students to parents of prospective multicultural students. 

","In addition to visiting high schools in rural and urban areas with large populations of low-income students, the Colgate admission staff works closely with a network of community based organizations whose missions are to prepare and guide underrepresented students through the process of applying to college and being successful once there. 

We work with multiple vendors to find high-achieving high school students from a range of backgrounds. Our outreach to these students and their parents uses both electronic and print communication to share a range of information from the broad (introductory information about Colgate, the liberal arts, financial aid) to the specific (academic programs, pre-professional opportunities, multicultural life, special interests).
","All our policies can be found on the Colgate website at http://www.colgate.edu/admission-financial-aid.

Colgate’s admission process is designed to identify individuals of academic skill, intellectual and cultural diversity, and wide-ranging interests and backgrounds. 

Each application is read by members of the admission staff and evaluated on its own terms, relative to the entire applicant group. The admission staff looks for demonstrated achievements and individual talents and differences. Our goal is to understand each student’s abilities and potential, and to admit the most able and promising mix of students.

Academic achievement and intellectual potential are the primary criteria for admission. Colgate also values demonstrated leadership, curiosity, and substantive involvement in extracurricular and community activities. The breadth and depth of a student’s interests, both in and out of the classroom, are important factors in the admission evaluation, helping to distinguish among the majority of applicants who demonstrate outstanding preparation for the academic challenge of Colgate.

In shaping the class, the admission staff seeks applicants representing diverse cultural, economic, racial, and geographic backgrounds whose talents and perspectives enrich the variety of ideas and experiences in the learning community.

Colgate is committed to meeting 100 percent of the demonstrated need of accepted students.

Many people assume that they cannot afford a private, highly selective liberal arts college such as Colgate.  However, need-based financial aid can help bridge the gap between what a family is asked to contribute and the full cost of attendance.

For students receiving Colgate grant during their first year of college our financial aid awards typically consist of grants, a modest student loan, and a campus job opportunity, with grant funds generally representing the largest portion of the financial aid award.  Students who don't receive aid during their first year at Colgate but who become eligible for assistance in a subsequent year generally receive loans and a job first, then grant to meet remaining need, if any.

Aid packages will usually include a Federal Direct Loan, which for 2012-13 has a fixed interest rate of either 3.4% (subsidized) or 6.8% (unsubsidized), depending on the student's  eligibility for federal aid.  Some students may be offered a Federal Perkins Loan, which carries a fixed interest rate of 5%. The type of loan received depends on a student's federal eligibility and on the availability of funds.

A campus job award can generally be earned by working between ten and twelve hours a week, which still leaves sufficient time for academics and activities.

The amount of financial assistance a family needs each year is determined by the following formula:

Total Cost to Attend
Estimated costs include:

Tuition and fees
Housing (standard double-room rate)
Dining (Bear Traditional meal plan)
Books and supplies
Travel and miscellaneous

Family Contribution
Income, assets, family size, and the number of children in college are all considered when calculating the amount your family can contribute. If parents are separated or not married, Cornell reviews each one’s financial information. Usually, each parent is expected to contribute, and that expectation continues throughout your undergraduate years.

Cornell may make exceptions to this if a family has special circumstances.

Financial Need
After deducting what a family can pay from the total cost to attend, a financial need is determined. A financial need may be met with a combination of work, loans and grants. 

Consistency
We try hard to be consistent in the way we consider financial circumstances from year to year. If a family's financial circumstances remain relatively unchanged throughout your time at Cornell, a predictable financial aid package each year can be expected.","The Pre Professional Programs (P3) is a programming and support initiative housed in the Office of Academic Diversity Initiatives for the purpose of recruiting, preparing and graduating underrepresented, economically disadvantaged, or first-generation students to the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) and Professional fields.

Denison University,2016-02-15,2016-02-15 15:55:45,kingje@denison.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Denison continues to have a need blind admissions policy.  When students are accepted for admission to Denison, they are evaluated for merit scholarship eligibility.  Approximately 93% of the students accepted for admissions are awarded one of the merit scholarships ranging from $8,000 to $46,000  annually for 8 semesters.  Knowing that a portion of the tuition can be covered for 4 years, provided the student maintains the required GPA, can help a low-income family begin to plan for the 4 year costs of college. 

If students apply for need based aid, the first source to meet federal need is the merit scholarship, if applicable. In addition to the merit awards,  Denison attempts to meet federal need with a combination of federal, state, and institutional funds.  In some cases of very high federal need, Denison is unable to meet 100% of this need.  If students receive outside scholarships, these awards can help meet unmet federal need.   

Denison’s generous gift aid program (merit scholarships and need based grants) was funded with $57 million in institutional grants and scholarships in 2014-15 and will exceed $59 this year.
",,,"Denison scholarships are awarded by the Admissions Office and are based on merit. Because Denison practices need blind admissions, the Admissions Office staff does not know anything about the income levels of the applicants.  Denison’s Financial Aid Office awards need based grant funds to low income students. Eligibility for these awards is based on the information filed on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   ","Both the Admissions Office and the Financial Aid Office make available to parents of low-income students a variety of resources that explain the financial aid process from start to finish.  These resources link parents with FAFSA forms, as well as calculators that help parents to assess true costs associated with attending Denison University.  Both offices have extensive websites that detail the application and financial aid processes and link to available scholarships, grants, loans, available to in-coming students.  During June Orientation, parents are given the opportunity to attend informational sessions relating to the college experience and to meet one-on-one with Financial Aid representatives.   ","Denison’s financial aid staff is actively involved in the following outreach activities that are designed to help encourage students from low-income background to consider pursuing college after completing high school by educating them about the resources available to them to make college affordable:

Financial Aid Night Presentations—
The Director of Financial Aid does several presentations annually in central Ohio high schools that have large enrollments of low-income students.  These presentations focus on the process of applying for aid and provide questions for the students and parents to ask at the respective colleges to which they will apply.  Students and parents are encouraged to apply to colleges with a variety of costs because a higher cost school can be more affordable because it often awards more financial aid.

Call to College in Newark, Ohio-
This organization focuses its efforts on assuring that qualified students in Newark High School from low-income backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue higher education.  The Financial Aid staff works closely with this organization to provide presentations when needed and to work with the Call to College counselors to encourage students to apply to Denison.

College Goal Sunday-
All of the Financial Aid staff volunteer to participate in this nationally organized annual event that takes place on a Sunday in February.  This event is designed to provide opportunities for families and students to actually complete the FAFSA with the assistance of financial aid professionals that volunteer to the event.  The college counselors at the sites hosting this event are appreciative of our willingness to help and they will encourage their students to include Denison in their list of schools to which they apply.

As part of our ongoing commitment to make high-quality undergraduate education more affordable, Duke announced in December 2007 a series of enhancements to its need-based undergraduate financial aid program that took effect in the 2008-09 academic year. These enhancements include

* eliminating the parental contribution for families with incomes less than $60,000;
* eliminating loans for families with incomes less than $40,000;
* reducing loans for students from families with incomes up to $85,000; and
* capping loans for eligible families with incomes above $85,000.
   
“The strength of the University depends on its ability to select and recruit students on the grounds of ability, dedication and promise, not on a family’s financial circumstances,” said President Richard H. Brodhead, who in his 2004 inaugural speech identified increasing the University’s endowment for financial aid as one of his highest priorities. “We have deliberately focused these new investments on relieving the burden not only for parents with incomes below the national median but for students from middle-income families as well.”

The 2012-13 Duke budget includes $128.2 million -- a 7 percent increase from the FY12 budget -- to support Duke’s undergraduate financial aid program and fund these enhancements. About 52 percent of undergraduates receive financial support to attend Duke; about 43 percent receive need-based aid.

Duke Financial Aid Policies and Procedures Guiding Principles
Duke University views its financial aid program as an investment in students and their futures. We seek a diverse student body and are committed to ensuring that aided students can take full advantage of the Duke experience. To that end, Duke admits U.S. citizens, permanent residents and a limited number of foreign students without regard to financial circumstance or aid eligibility and meets 100 percent of each admitted student's demonstrated need throughout their nine semesters of potential undergraduate enrollment.

Duke, like many similar institutions, uses the 568 Presidents' Group Consensus Approach to Needs Analysis to determine each student's family contribution. This formula, whose guiding principles are articulated under Bulletin Board/Tips on this page, is designed to ensure that families with similar circumstances contribute similar amounts while families with different financial circumstances contribute proportionally different amounts toward a student's annual attendance costs. Duke does not ""negotiate"" financial aid, but does consider extenuating circumstances that may affect a family's ability to support educational expenses. Applicants are encouraged to submit dollar‐specific details relative to any extenuating or unusual circumstances that affect their ability to support educational expenses.

In addition to need‐based scholarships, grants and loans, merit scholarships are integral to Duke's financial aid program. Although all merit scholarships are awarded at the time of admission on the basis of academic distinction, other factors ‐‐ such as leadership, musical talent and other unique characteristics ‐‐ are considered. Several of these programs are awarded without regard to a student's demonstrated need. Recipients who meet the specified academic standards will retain their merit scholarship for the four years they are enrolled at Duke. Applicants for admission are considered for all available merit scholarships. No specific scholarship application is available or required.
",,"A two-day pre-orientation program followed by ongoing support throughout the academic year is provided for high-need, first generation students. The program introduces students to the university ""system"" to help them negotiate more effectively and also introduces them to faculty to help them make meaningful academic connections on the first day. This program also promotes a sense of belonging and strength. ","The majority of assistance offered by Duke is in the form of need-based grants and scholarships. These funds do not have to be repaid and are calculated based on information from the CSS Profile and accompanying documentation. Students receiving need-based grants or scholarships from Duke are largely supported through endowments established by donors, and students receiving these awards may be asked to write thank-you letters to individual donors after receiving these awards.",See above. Duke also has a parallel two day pre-orientation program for parents of first generation students. ,"Excerpt from the current Duke Strategic Plan – 
Chapter 3 - Duke's Enduring Themes -  Affordability and access

Duke's historic commitment to affordability and access was built on the fundamental principle of justice, on our belief that access to higher education - and thereby worldly success - should be available to all, not simply to those who can pay. But in modern America, qualification for college admission has had a high correlation with family income, and the premier private universities tend to recruit classes substantially tipped toward upper income sectors. Universities alone, of course, cannot affect or right every cause contributing to the unequal preparation of the young. But just for that reason, we have a special obligation to do what we can, and assuming the share of costs that a family cannot afford to pay is our way of assuring that we recruit students on the grounds of ability, dedication, and promise alone, not of family circumstance. Moreover, society has a profound self-interest in seeing that those with talent have access to quality education. We tend to take for granted the dynamism that makes our economy and culture develop wealth and an envied quality of life, but there is no reason to believe these things are self-sustaining. They are driven by human intelligence and creativity, and for renewal, these resources need cultivation and investment. Making sure that those gifted with these traits get the education that will allow them to give the greatest return on their talents is the best way to provide for this social good. It is safe to say that the talent upon which we will someday want to draw is not confined to a single social origin or band of income.

Duke's commitment to financial aid and need-blind admission is the investment we make to produce the trained talent our future world will require - and when we think of graduate and professional schools, this means the talent that will keep our own fields strong and strongly advancing. Some 45% of all Duke undergraduates receive aid from the University. To meet the challenge to be able to ensure that we select and recruit students on the grounds of ability, dedication and promise alone, we have recently engaged in a $300 million Financial Aid initiative to strengthen Duke's financial aid endowment. We have dedicated our institutional resources to financial aid over time, and launched this focused and substantial fundraising effort, not only because of our responsibility to nurture talent for the good of society at large, but also because we believe that when we enable students to come to Duke from other income groups, other regions, other countries, we create a better experience not just for them but for every member of our common community.

* We must provide increased support to ensure broader access to our undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools.
* We must increase support for professional students committed to less remunerative careers.

Graduate Student Affairs - Diversity Initiatives

The Graduate School has a long-standing commitment to increasing the diversity and quality of its graduate student body. Our primary goals are to increase enrollment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups, to provide students with sufficient funding to complete their graduate studies in a timely manner, and to promote an academic and social environment where these scholars can flourish. Targeted recruiting strategies (including undergraduate research opportunities like the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) that give potential students a taste of the graduate student experience) are vital to these efforts, and the involvement of Duke's graduate faculty is central to these strategies.

Recruitment
A key mission of the Office of Graduate Student Affairs is to coordinate, supplement, and expand the recruiting efforts of graduate departments and programs. Each year GSA participates in recruitment fairs across the country that enable us to meet potential graduate students and to answer any questions they might have about Duke's graduate programs. GSA coordinates with other nearby schools to bring talented undergraduates from across the country to visit our campuses. Activities during these visits typically include seminars on graduate admissions and financial aid, panel discussions with faculty and graduate students, departmental visitations, and informal gatherings.

Other mechanisms the Graduate School employs in the recruitment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups include participation in national consortia designed to promote diversity in graduate education; targeted faculty recruitment visits to colleges and universities; and the development of external and institutional funding to support summer research opportunities for undergraduates.
Retention

GSA provides general counseling for students from traditionally underrepresented groups, develops programs to enhance their participation in graduate student life, and helps students to identify external sources of funding. The office also provides recruitment, retention, and completion data and helps to initiate various summer research opportunities that identify potential graduate students early in their college careers.

","When awarding undergraduate financial aid, Duke adheres to the following principles:

To the extent they are able, parents and students have the primary responsibility to contribute to educational expenses before Duke awards financial aid. 
Families should contribute to educational expenses according to their ability. Those with similar financial profiles should contribute similar amounts. 
Both income and assets, including business income and assets, are part of the assessment of the parents' and applicants' ability to pay. 
Institutional aid is awarded on the basis of financial need as determined by the information provided on an applicant's CSS Profile and supporting tax and wage information. 

In addition, 

From http://financialaid.duke.edu/undergraduate-applicants/how-does-it-work (Duke's Financial Aid Website)

Your family contribution is made up of two parts: the amount expected from parent(s) and the amount expected from you. Duke expects a minimum contribution from a first-year student of $2,600 per year, regardless of income. The parent contribution is calculated by the Financial Aid Office based on the income and assets held by the family.  Families with a total annual income of $60,000 or less, and typical assets, will have an expected parent contribution of $0. 

Once we’ve determined your family contribution, we’ll build your financial aid award.  The financial aid award may consist of work study, limited student loans*, grants, and scholarships.  All applicants are offered up to $2,200 in work-study funding, which can be earned during the academic year. (Click here to learn more about what work study is and how it can help.)  In addition to work study, some applicants are offered federal or low-interest loans. The rest of your family's need will be met with grants and scholarships.","The Financial Aid System at Duke has multiple steps. Undergraduate applicants can calculate their aid on the duke financial aid website. 

Once the appropriate loan and work-study levels have been applied, the remaining financial aid will be issued in the form of need-based grants and scholarships.","To help families with more than one child in school:

Duke adjusts the expected contribution for families receiving need-based aid with multiple students in college at the same time. The Parent Contribution is adjusted to 60% of the full calculated contribution for families who have two children in college and to 45% of the full calculated contribution for those with three children in college.  Please see the notes below for the guidelines regarding these adjustments.",--,"Students taking fewer than three credits during an academic term have their tuition prorated based on a per-course tuition charge and their book allowance reduced to half their full-time allotment. Such students are subject to the following:

The tuition component of their budget for the term is reduced to the amount charged on their Bursar’s bill. The book component of their budget for the term is reduced to half of their full-time allowance. Need-based aid is reduced to reflect the reduced eligibility that results from the lower charges. Eligibility for certain programs is affected. Part-time students are not eligible to receive the North Carolina Tuition Grant for that term. Pell Grant award amounts for that term are reduced.  To determine the correct Pell amount, the payment schedule for periods less than full-time must be consulted.","Duke Child Care Partnership - Parents who work at Duke University and Health System have greater access to quality child care through the Duke Child Care Partnership.

On-site Child Care at Duke - Duke faculty, staff and graduate students have two options for on-site childcare at Duke: the Duke Children's Campus and The Little School at Duke.

Child Care Services Association - Choosing a child care provider can be a difficult decision. Child Care Services Association, a non profit child care resource and referral agency, helps families access affordable high-quality child care for their children from birth through age 12. This service is provided free of charge.

Fixed Tuition (https://undergraduate.admissions.gwu.edu/gws-fixed-tuition): GW’s fixed tuition plan gives families the ability to know and plan for the full cost of a four year education. While housing costs may change, tuition will remain the same for an entire undergraduate program, provided the student follows requirements.

Pell Grants (http://financialaid.gwu.edu/federal-pell-grant): The number of GW students receiving Pell Grants has steadily increased from 9 percent in 2008-09 to 14 percent in 2013-14.","Through HR, MSSC, and Service Excellence, the university offers limited, but on-going training and workshop for faculty and professional and pre-professional staff working with special populations, such as students from low-income and underrepresented backgrounds. Additionally, through the office of Diversity & Inclusion, the University sponsors a grants program called Innovation in Diversity and Inclusion, where we have received numerous proposals that can be utilized to better serve students from low-income backgrounds.
The GW Task Force on Access and Success offered recommendations to reduce barriers and create opportunities to enroll low-income, first-generation and/or students underrepresented in STEM fields and careers. The task force recommendations emphasize high impact, replicable models for success.
The Task Force formalized a number of new initiatives including a test-optional policy; no longer requiring most undergraduate applicants to submit SAT or ACT test scores.
Ongoing access initiatives include DC College Application Week, which is part of a national effort to increase the number of first-generation and low-income students who pursue a postsecondary education.
","As mentioned earlier, GW's MSSC sponsors a number of programs to prepare students such as the RISE program, Black Men's Initiative, and partnerships with the University Counseling Center to gain awareness and work-through the challenges of long-term persistence at a predominately white institution (PWI).  

Private foundations and donors are funding scholarships that enable high school students from target populations --first-generation, Latino, Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian-- to enroll in new summer pre-college programs.  GW is hosting several seminars and symposia such as the 2015 Reach for College! College Readiness Summer Institute for Educators and the Graduate School of Human Development and Education’s College Access and Affordability Institute.

In partnership with local nonprofits and GW student organizations, GW’s Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service co-sponsored college awareness and readiness programs for 35 families of two DC middle schools, 33 Vietnamese high school students and their parents and 60 Latino elementary school students. ","The George Washington University Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Scholars program offers full scholarships to D.C. students. GW awards some incoming freshmen from D.C. a scholarship that covers tuition, room and board, books and fees. Students apply with their application for admission and they must also meet requirements and participate in campus activities to maintain the scholarship.

GW’s Power & Promise fund ensures that qualified students can take advantage of a GW education, no matter their financial resources. The fund has raised more than $100 million for scholarships in the past five years.

University and Alumni Award is a need based grant may be awarded to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The Alumni Award can be used only towards tuition expenses.

One Year Award is a grant that may be awarded in response to an appeal for additional assistance based on documented extraordinary extenuating circumstances.

Say Yes to Education: This organization and GW have partnered to provide scholarships (http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/gw-offer-scholarships-%E2%80%98say-yes-education%E2%80%99-students) for public high school students meeting certain criteria in Syracuse and Buffalo N.Y., and Guilford County, N.C. This partnership is part of a larger initiative to make college accessible for first generation students.

University Awards and Scholarships may be awarded as part of  a student’s financial assistance package. Eligible undergraduate students are identified by the office of student financial assistance and there are no separate applications for these awards.


Native American Political Leadership Program (INSPIRE) (http://inspire.naplp.gwu.edu/about-inspire-pre-college-program): The program offers a full scholarship, pre-college program to Native American, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian high school students. Recipients spend three weeks at GW in the summer and complete a full undergraduate course.

Gil and Jacki Cisneros Institute (http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/alumnus-gilbert-cisneros-donates-7-million-gw): The institute helps qualified students attain academic success, build leadership skills, and engage in a long-term commitment to making a difference within the Hispanic community. Students who have demonstrated commitments to leadership, community service and giving back to the Hispanic community, will be considered for Cisneros Scholarships, a  four year scholarship that includes mentorship and support. The Cisneros institute also offers a full scholarship pre-college summer program for high school juniors committed to leadership and service in the Hispanic community.

Several university offices offer a number of financial opportunities for underrepresented students to pursue and continue their higher education studies. Scholarship opportunities exist for military veteran’s and/or their spouses and students with disabilities. 
GW is a partner with the Pat Tillman Foundation in providing financial support to military veteran’s and/or spouses through the Tillman Military Scholars Program. The Office of Disability Support Services awards a number of scholarships to currently enrolled, degree seeking students including incoming freshman students.

GW is participating in an Early College Program at the School Without Walls public high school in the GW Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where students can pursue associate degrees from GW while still in high school; and workshops for juniors and seniors to provide tips on how to prepare and submit their college applications.
","As part of its recruitment practices and programming, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions regularly provides information on applying and affordability to all prospective students, parents, and high school counselors. The office seeks to cast a wide net in order to attract as diverse a pool of applicants as possible, which enables GW to enroll a diverse student population. Some examples of admissions outreach efforts include:
• Affordability, scholarship, and financial aid information that is sent to applicants via email.
• Several on campus events in both fall and spring for high school juniors and seniors. Travel grants are provided upon request in the fall, and bus transportation is provided to students from New York City in the spring.
• Partnership with Yes Prep school district in Texas to recruit, admit, and enroll first generation and low-income students.
• A GW hosted information session on the SJT Scholars program for all public, private, and charter schools in D.C. at a neighborhood library.
• Partnerships with several community-based organizations, such as the Center for Student Opportunity, which serves low-income and first generation students. GW is listed in their College Access and Opportunity Guide, which provides scholarship and financial aid information for students.
• Partnership with Chicago Scholars program to offer onsite admissions information and decisions to first generation and low-income students.
• The Admissions staff annually visits 1,200+ high schools throughout the country, including public and charter schools in urban and rural areas that generally have large percentages of first generation and low-income students. We also host several off campus information sessions in these areas.
The Office of Admissions continued with their implementation of DC-focused programming that improves the readiness and increases the number of students enrolling in colleges across the nation. Among the new initiatives are programs bringing 30 high school counselors and 25 juniors to campus; a service project deploying the undergraduate admissions staff during College Application Week to assist students completing college applications at DC high schools; and dedicated staff to support and implement best practices in DC high schools that improve college readiness. The 30% increase in DC high school graduates enrolled in the Fall 2014 first-year class demonstrates GW’s enhanced commitment to local students.
","If students indicate that they cannot afford the application fee, the office of admissions will waive the application fee. 

The Office of Admissions routinely reviews/grants request for payment plans to cover the enrollment deposit.
","The overall financial aid policy of the university is as follows. Based on the results of the financial aid application, a determination is made on the amount a family can contribute to the student’s educational expenses. When there is a difference between the familial contribution and our cost of attendance, the university uses both its funding and federal funds to award financial aid to bridge this difference.

As part of GW's fix-tuition policy, upon enrollment a portion of a student’s financial need-based award will be guaranteed for all four years. This allows the student and parents to plan their four years of education knowing tuition will not increase and a portion of the need based award will remain the same for all four years. If the “need” increases other funds will be used to address the need of the student/family. ","The Federal Work Study Program is a federally-funded work program that allows students who qualify to earn money while working at a pre-approved organization: GW departments, local nonprofits, government agencies and community service employers.

Posse Foundation (https://www.possefoundation.org/): GW announced (http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/gw-teams-posse-foundation-increase-diverse-students%E2%80%99-access-university) in 2015 that it would partner with the Posse Foundation, which finds extraordinary students who may have been overlooked by traditional college selection processes and instead helps them prepare for it. Each year beginning in 2016, 10 Posse scholars from the Atlanta, Georgia area will join GW. After four years, there will be a total of 40 on campus. Posse scholars generally achieve a 90 percent graduation rate.

STEM Pipeline Partnership (http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/gw-nova-celebrate-new-partnership): GW and the Northern Virginia Community College have partnered to provide a path for STEM students who complete their associate’s degree to earn a bachelor’s degree through GW’s College of Professional Studies.

Dual Enrollment DCPS Partnership: GW partners with the District of Columbia Public Schools to provide full tuition dual enrollment opportunities through the GW Early College Program (GWECP). Students complete their last two years of high school while earning an Associates of Arts degree from GW.   GW also funds tuition for high school students who enroll in GW courses through the Exposure and High School/College Internship Programs.

Each year up to 15 students are selected, and they join other cohorts to participate in summer enrichment and academic preparation, community service, and special skill-building experiences. Students who complete the program in high school receive tuition-waiver scholarships toward the completion of associate's and bachelor's degree programs at Carl Sandburg College and Knox, respectively. Highly academically successful students at Galesburg High School may qualify for direct enrollment at Knox College.

The program was recognized by the Illinois Board of Higher Education in 1999 as one of six exemplary ""best practices"" within the State of Illinois -- a program that directly addresses the growing number of youth who, because of socio-economic barriers, often are not given the opportunity to realize their full potential as scholars and future leaders in our community.

On the basis of this and other programs, Washington Monthly (2012) ranked Knox College number 11 among Top Colleges in Service to Public Good.

College 4 Kids is a summer program at Knox, engaging students in grades three through eight.  In 2012, more than 260 children participated in more than 40 courses in the humanities, physical and social sciences, fine arts, languages, and mathematics.  The 2012 attendance was the most diverse in the program's history.  Courses are designed to engage high-achieving students, as well as serving as an entryway into higher education for many children of color and those from low-socio-economic-status backgrounds who, in the future, might be the first in their families to attend college.

Additional resources are available through the Office of Inclusion and Multicultural Student Services; Native American Student Services, Gateway Center, and University College.
","Educational Talent Search and Educational Opportunity Centers are examples of two programs that NAU utilizes in recruiting students from low-income backgrounds.  Educational Talent Search increases educational and career awareness among middle school and high school students, enhances the number of students who complete middle and high school, encourages the number of students who continue and/or re-enter high school equivalency programs or enter post-secondary programs and vocational training, and decreases the number of dropouts and stop-outs.  Participants must be potential first-generation college students or from a low-income family. Educational Opportunity Centers main objective is to provide information and assistance to adults 19 years of age and older seeking to enter or continue a program of postsecondary education (two-year, four-year college, or vocational/technical school).

Oregon State University shares concerns with students and their parents over the importance of keeping a college education accessible and affordable. We recognize that access to post-secondary education, declining college affordability, and a high proportion of students who fail to graduate from colleges in a timely manner are critical issues for academic institutions in Oregon and nationally.

At Oregon State, we are committed to effectively address these issues in timely and on-going ways.

The university continues to build an increasingly diverse and inclusive student community. To help the state advance towards its 40-40-20 goal, the university has increased its enrollment in the past three years by 20 percent, ensuring access for qualified Oregonians. At the same time, Oregon State works hard to attract high achieving students from Oregon high schools and community colleges to ensure that we retain them in the state.  And we are committed to maintain affordability, and yet improve the quality of education we offer students, and reduce the time it takes for a student to earn a degree.

To help achieve these outcomes, Oregon State has:
•	Provided support to more than 2,800 students each year through the Bridge to Success program, which covers full tuition and fees for students in the program
•	Raised $150 million for academic scholarships through the Campaign for OSU in collaboration with the OSU Foundation.  Each year, more than 4,000 students receive donor-funded scholarships and fellowships totaling more than $7.5 million.
•	Consolidated business services and academic units to reduce administrative costs and direct as much funding as possible to the delivery of educational programs that allow on-time graduation.

Pitzer does not include unsubsidized federal loans or parent PLUS loans as part of the financial aid award, unless specifically requested by the student or parent, to ensure students are borrowing as little as necessary. All regularly admitted students receive a copy of the Federal Shopping Sheet with their financial aid award to encourage the student to compare costs at comparison schools in a uniform, and clear format.

Our use of institutional methodology collects a more comprehensive accounting of the applicant’s financial circumstances than is possible with the FAFSA application. Students are able to report both prior year and expected income, which provides household income trends that the financial aid administrator can use to better understand the family’s ability to contribute to college costs. The application also collects information about unusually high medical/dental expenses, which we take into consideration and will decrease a parent contribution when limited family resources are being directed to nondiscretionary health care costs. Further, institutional methodology accounts for a larger protection of family income for living expenses than federal methodology, and a lower family contribution towards educational costs for our highest need students.",,,"Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (Federal/institutional Grant) – Scholarship assistance funded by Federal and Institutional contributions that are awarded to students with very high need.

Attendees are hosted by current students in the residence halls and dine on campus throughout the three-day weekend. The program provides prospective students an opportunity to experience the distinct atmosphere that sets Pitzer College apart from other colleges while interacting with current students, faculty, staff and other high school seniors considering Pitzer.

Bilingual Family Orientation:
Alongside New student Orientation we partnered with Diversity and Multicultural Student Services, Financial Aid, and various campus academic advisers to offer a Bilingual Spanish Orientation for Latino Families on July 11, 2014.

Initial evaluations of students take into account their GPA, completion of 15 core subject areas with a C- or better, and standardized test scores. While grades tend to be the best indicators of success, we also acknowledge that there are other factors in students lives. Because of these other factors, when students do not meet our general admission  requirements, we offer opportunities to explain why and prove they would be successful candidates for admission through a more holistic admission process. Rolling admissions is another example of our commitment to access.
The federal government offers a number of financial aid programs. Besides aid from the U.S. Department of Education (discussed below),a student may also receive:
●	aid for serving in the military or for being the spouse or child of a veteran,
●	tax benefits for education,
●	an Education Award for community service with AmeriCorps,
●	Educational and Training Vouchers for current and former foster care youth, and/or
●	scholarships and loan repayment through the Department of Health and Human Services’ Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health, and National Health Service Corps.
The U.S. Department of Education awards about $150 billion a year in grants, work-study funds, and low-interest loans to more than 14 million students. Federal student aid covers such expenses as tuition and fees,room and board, books and supplies, and transportation. Aid also can help pay for other related expenses, such as a computer and dependent care. Thousands of schools across the country participate in the federal student aid programs; ask the schools you’re interested in whether they do!
Federal student aid includes:
●	Grants—financial aid that doesn’t have to be repaid (unless, for example, you withdraw from school and owe a refund)
●	Loans— borrowed money for college or career school; you must repay your loans, with interest
●	Work-Study—a work program through which you earn money to help you pay for school”

","PSU’s Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships operates under the State and Federal directive that higher education should be accessible and affordable to all low-income students. Further more, we have adopted the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, ‘Principles of Excellence’ policy. Every staff member of the department agrees, acknowledges, and signs a statement of adherence to the following:
• Commit to removing financial barriers for those who want to pursue postsecondary learning 
and support each student admitted to our institution. 
• Without charge, assist students in applying for financial aid funds.
• Provide services and apply principles that do not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, 
ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or economic status.

Princeton University,2016-01-20,2016-01-20 17:01:10,kristiw@princeton.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Princeton's need-based aid program is one of the best in the nation. In 2001, Princeton became the first university to offer every aid recipient a financial aid package that replaces loans with grant aid (scholarships) that students do not pay back. Since then, Princeton has been able to enroll growing numbers of students from low- and middle-income backgrounds with the grant aid they need to make our costs affordable.",,"Princeton sponsors multiple programs designed specifically for lower-income students including Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America (LEDA), a program that brings talented, low-income high school seniors to Princeton for summer courses and college counseling and supports them throughout their college experience, Princeton's Freshman Scholars Institute, and the Princeton University Preparatory Program (PUPP), which successfully prepares disadvantaged New Jersey students for admission to selective colleges. Princeton enrolls a higher number of LEDA alumni than any other institution and is hoping to grow the number of students who benefit from the summer program by at least 50 percent.

Princeton also provides many Academic Resources for students, including a center on campus with free tutors for a variety of subjects. There is also the Princeton University Mentoring Program (PUMP) whose mission is to enrich and support the lives of students from historically underrepresented backgrounds through leadership, mentoring, and community building activities. Their goal is to assist first year students in their transition into campus life and provide a network to encourage academic and social exploration. PUMP matches each first year participant with a mentor from the sophomore, junior or senior class based on similar academic and social interests. The combination of one-on-one and cluster mentoring is designed to support students and encourage them to contribute to the Princeton University community.
 
PUPP website: http://www.princeton.edu/pupp/
 
PUMP website: http://www.princeton.edu/fieldscenter/pump/","Applicants receive aid based on their families’ financial need. For example, those with a family income of under $65,000 qualify for a scholarship in the form of “need based grants”, which cover full tuition and room and board. Princeton does not use income cutoffs when determining whether to award aid. Any student whose family feels unable to afford the full cost of attendance is encouraged to apply for aid.","Princeton offers several online resources for parents that provide information on several topics: from the application process to the ins and outs of the Princeton college experience. The admissions website has a helpful Princeton Financial Aid Estimator which determines a family's ability to pay using Princeton's own need formula, with fair and generous individual results. The admissions office also offers live chats on Google Hangout with current students that are archived for access at any time. Additionally, Princeton offers an English and Spanish financial aid brochure that explains Princeton’s financial aid program, which is also available on the web.
 
Princeton has been active in reaching out to community-based organizations, and often presents at parent and family evening programs.  For example, Princeton hosted a few fall trips which paired an admission officer and a financial aid officer on the road. A trip to the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas included shared presentations with Stanford and Dartmouth. Among other events, Princeton hosted evening programs for students and their families, and also hosted a special breakfast for parents, which had 200 in attendance. Princeton Admissions also presents at several QuestBridge summer conferences on their parent panels as well as a parent panel for the IIT Boeing Scholars and UChicago Collegiate Scholars college night.","Princeton University hosted a first-generation and low-income Admission Live “Hangout” via Google Hangouts. Interested students were emailed and informed about the live chat and also about the archived chat. The chat was archived and is available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd-8tIy1IBU#t=43m32s). 
 
One example of a trip targeting low-income students was to the Central Valley of California, with stops in some of the poorest counties in the state. During the trip, three evening events with families were held. In the small, farming town of Parlier, where 31% of its residents live below the poverty level and only 5% of the population over age 25 have a bachelor’s degree, Princeton presented to over 70 people about selective colleges and its remarkable financial aid. In addition, Princeton hosts events in Washington, D.C., and Chicago every year that reach out to under-represented populations, which includes students from low-income homes.","Princeton has a need-blind admission policy, ensuring equality of opportunity for students who cannot afford the full cost of attendance. Princeton accepts students regardless of their ability to pay the cost of attendance and meets their full demonstrated need with a ""no loan"" aid package. There is no disadvantage of any kind in the admission process for financial aid applicants.","Most students will be offered a term-time job as part of their financial aid award. Princeton has developed an extensive campus employment program to encourage students to work and help pay for some of their college expenses. Part of the funding comes from the Federal Work-Study Program. Students are expected to use their earnings, paid directly to them every two weeks, to meet their book and personal expenses. During their freshman year, students can meet their job earnings expectation if they work an average of 9 hours a week for 30 weeks. Campus jobs are available in the library, dining halls, computing center, sustainability office, and various other departments. Freshmen are usually assigned jobs in the library or dining halls. Princeton encourages students to work in community service areas such as social services, transportation, public safety, crime prevention, recreation, youth service and other activities specified in the Community Service Act under the Federal Work-Study Program. More information about these job opportunities is available from the Princeton Student Employment Program.
 
The University assigns grant funds from a variety of sources: endowment, general revenues, yearly gifts from alumni and friends, and federal programs. Princeton grants are awarded on the basis of financial need. Some have additional conditions placed on the selection of recipients. Since the Financial Aid Office is responsible for matching students with specific Princeton funds, it is not necessary to file a separate application for University grants.
 
Students from New Jersey, or those who graduate from New Jersey high schools, who are eligible for need-based grant aid from Princeton receive their awards from the William H. Cane Fund. Cane recipients are not required to work (including both term-time and summer employment) and therefore receive a larger portion of grant aid in their award. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOGs) are
government funds administered by Princeton and are assigned to students along with University grant funds. Preference in awarding SEOGs is given to students with the lowest expected family contributions.",,--,There are not part-time undergraduate students at Princeton. ,"There are two University-affiliated childcare centers.

More specifically, federal Work-Study is a part-time employment program for students who have demonstrated financial need according to eligibility criteria set forth by the federal government. Students are limited to earning the dollar amount shown on their award letter.  ",,"Rice offers a number of programs to prepare students from low-income backgrounds for higher education, most notably Project GRAD and QuestBridge: 

(1) Project GRAD: Initiated in 2001, Rice University's campus is one of the Houston sites for the Project GRAD Summer Academy. Project GRAD is a school-community collaborative in the Houston Independent School District to improve the instructional quality and culture of at-risk feeder systems of schools.  The program serves 64 schools and over 44,000 economically disadvantaged children. The mission of Project GRAD's scholarship program is to increase the graduation and college attendance rates of disadvantaged inner-city students in Houston through summer institutes, teacher and staff training, strong parental involvement, and enhanced curricula. The Rice University Project GRAD Advanced Summer Mathematics Academy is a summer program designed to ensure the success of students in advanced mathematics courses, while exposing them to a selective university atmosphere.
Rice faculty and staff offer a three-week Advanced Mathematics Institute, Nanochemistry Institute, and Summer Business Institute during the summer to expose underserved minority students to diverse academic/career paths.  
To further help support the high school students’ transition to college and put them on footing with more advantaged peers, Rice offers its resources—pioneering research faculty, state-of-the art laboratories and science institutes, and innovative educational and support programs—to the Project GRAD College Institutes.  

(2) QuestBridge: Rice University is a partner college of QuestBridge, a powerful platform bridging the nation's brightest, under-served youth and leading institutions of higher education and further opportunities. QuestBridge provides a single, internet-based meeting point which links exceptional students with colleges, scholarship providers, enrichment programs employers, and organizations seeking students who have excelled despite obstacles.

Grants: 
(1) Rice Tuition Grant: funding awarded to students with unmet institutional need-based financial aid eligibility after the awards below have been added. Rice ensures that a student's unmet financial need is entirely covered through various financial aid types. 

(2) Federal or State Grants: grants that are provided by the federal or state governments based on a student’s demonstrated financial need. For example: 
(a) Pell Grants: For the 2014-2015 aid year, undergraduate students with a federal Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of $5157 or less may be eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant. The amount of each grant is determined by the student's EFC. These funds are provided by the federal government and are available to you as long as you qualify.

(b) Tuition Equalization Grants (TEGs): Students from Texas may qualify for a Tuition Equalization Grant (TEG). These funds are limited and are awarded to undergraduate students with the highest need on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Loans: 
(1) The Direct Subsidized Loan: A need-based loan with a fixed interest rate.  The government pays the interest subsidy while the student is enrolled at least half-time.  Repayment begins after the 6-month grace period when the student graduates, withdraws, or drops below half-time enrollment. 

(2) Federal Perkins Loan: The Federal Perkins loan is a campus-based federally subsidized loan program awarded to students with exceptional need who are enrolled at least half-time.","As part of the recruiting process, Rice communicates with parents.

These students then receive an email from Rice which informs them that they were found through the College Board search process.  It instructs them to fill out a form on Rice’s website in order to find more information and receive email updates from Rice’s mailing list.  The form specifically asks for parent’s email address, which Rice then uses to contact parents directly.

Although Saint Louis University fits into this tuition fee category, 23 percent of SLU students received need-based Pell grant funds last year, 24 percent of new freshmen were first generation and over 25 percent of SLU undergraduates received need-based grants. Some of SLU's access programs include its 1818 Advanced College Credit program (affordable credit earned in high school); adult and online offerings; federal TRIO programs and support (Student Support Services and Talent Search Program); transfer partnerships with local community colleges and universities (includes 2+SLU programs with partner schools St. Louis Community College and Harris Stowe State University); and military and veteran programs (includes new outreach, advising, scholarships and reduced tuition rates).","Saint Louis University’s teaching community is supported by its Reinert Center for Transformative Teaching and Learning, a comprehensive teaching center devoted to assisting faculty, instructors and other educators in providing a variety of instructional development, design services, seminars and programs. In 2015, the Reinert Center launched a pilot program focused on helping SLU faculty and instructors design and teach courses in ways that are more culturally responsive. This program has been beneficial and impactful, particularly for nontraditional students, from international, under-represented, under-served and first-generation, as well as well as returning adult students, veterans and others who come back to the classroom after having been steeped in workplace, military and family cultures.","Saint Louis University's Department of Pre-College and Access Programs develops, supports and oversees a wide range of outreach activities designed to increase college awareness and readiness skills, such as K-12 academies, camps and enrichment programs in a variety of academic disciplines, each aimed at assisting young students to prepare for college while experiencing life at SLU.

The Jesuit Community Scholarship is given to one student from each of the 28 Catholic high schools in the Archdiocese of St. Louis as well as four Catholic high schools in the Metro East.
 
The Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship is granted to students who are committed to the promotion of diversity in our society and who demonstrate leadership in the classroom, on campus and in the greater community.","SLU’s Office of Student Financial Services assists students and their families in financing their SLU education.

Because of Smith's commitment to access, the admissions office targets inner-city schools in recruitment efforts in order to attract students from low-income backgrounds.  The admissions office is well aware that SAT scores are highly correlated with income, and therefore has made submission of SAT scores optional and put more weight on teacher recommendations, high-school performance, and other measures as criteria for admissions. 

Smith's outreach initiatives to recruit students from low-income and underrepresented backgrounds are made through programs such as:
-Posse (first group will arrive in fall 2015)                                                                                                                                 -Springfield/Holyoke Partnership (4 full-tuition scholarships)
-College Horizons (pre-college workshops for Native students)
-Alumnae Outreach
-Women of Distinction fly-in program for targeted students
-Discovery Weekend program for admitted students
-Summer Science and Engineering Program (SSEP)-scholarships for low income students
-Multicultural Recruitment Luncheons
-Multicultural Recruitment Working Group

These programs are not only meant to recruit students from low income backgrounds, but are also meant to help encourage and give access to opportunities resources for students who may not otherwise qualify without these programs. ","Smith's financial aid policy states that:
""Smith College seeks to provide educational opportunity for qualified students, knowing that many of them will require financial assistance. Our need-based aid program begins with a consistent, yet personalized, assessment of each applicant's ability to pay for college expenses. Smith meets the full documented need, as determined by college policy, of all admitted students who apply for aid by the published deadlines. Some admission decisions may include an assessment of the student's level of need. These need-sensitive evaluations affect approximately 5 percent of all applicants"".","For all aided students, the budget includes allowances for books and travel to campus. For very low-income students, additional grant aid may be available to cover health insurance, and other items.",,True,"Smith's Ada Comstock program helps non-traditional women students -- who must be at least 24 years old -- complete college.

Through the Financial Aid Program, Stanford meets 100% of the demonstrated financial need of all eligible students. Parents whose total annual income is less than $60,000 and who have assets typical for their income level are not expected to contribute toward educational costs. Parents with income between $60,000 and $100,000 are expected to contribute somewhere between $0 and the cost of room and board, ensuring enough scholarship funds to cover the cost of tuition at a minimum. Students are not expected to borrow to cover their educational costs.","Early in 2011, Stanford created a new position for a director of diversity and programs for first generation students. In addition to serving as a resource for students, the director’s role includes outreach and coordination among other campus resources to meet the needs of first generation and low income students. Student Affairs staff and academic advising staff coordinate regularly with the Financial Aid Office to ensure availability of resources for students from low-income backgrounds. ","A plethora of summer programs are offered on campus to prepare students to attend either Stanford University or the college/university of their choice.

In summer of 2012 the inaugural Leland Scholars Program was offered to incoming freshmen from under-resourced high schools, at no cost to the students, to ease the transition to Stanford.  Lastly, through the Haas Center for Public Service, Stanford students participate in programs that support students in local low-income neighborhoods. Some examples are the East Palo Alto Stanford Academy, Jumpstart, Stanford College Prep, Science in Service, and Ravenswood Reads.","For the 2012-2013 academic year, Stanford undergraduates received more than $179 million in financial assistance, including over $166 million in scholarships and grants. These funds support the 68% of students at Stanford who receive some form of financial aid.  49% of all students receive need-based scholarships from Stanford. There are two basic criteria to establish eligibility for these funds: students must be admitted to Stanford and demonstrate financial need. Scholarships are used to meet students’ full need, giving all admitted students the opportunity to attend Stanford.","A collection of resources for parents can be found with just one click from Stanford’s home page.

In addition, the office maintains a database of over 700 CBO’s and sends regular communications to each CBO.  CBO leaders are encouraged to request assistance to conduct presentations to students throughout the travel season.  The admission office is also actively engaged with the College Horizons, Questbridge and Cherokee Nation summer programs where officers mentor young students about preparation for the college admission process.   The office also hosts a number of visiting groups on campus by providing information sessions and tours. ","As part of the University’s commitment to a comprehensive holistic review process, each admission officer takes into account the context of the student’s background.

The only exception is Athletic Aid. In addition, through Undergraduate Advising and Research, the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education partners with faculty, departments, research centers, and interdisciplinary programs to facilitate and promote research opportunities for undergraduates through a generous grant program.

We provide a holistic approach to services and counseling for our students.

Morris participates in all available state and federal financial aid programs and we offer need-based institutional scholarships.

Additional information:


Ninety-three percent of UMM students receive financial aid from a variety of public and private sources. The campus is regularly recognized as an affordable “best buy” in higher education, graduating students with more manageable levels of loan debt than peer institutions.

UMM is committed to providing sufficient financial assistance to meet the full financial
need of each student and works actively to minimize the student’s dependence on student loans. 

Staff encourage and assist all students in completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to qualify for grant and scholarship aid. Financial Aid encourages students to use Federal Work Study instead of loans when available and possible.

UMM has the largest percentage of students in the University of Minnesota receiving the U Promise Scholarships for high need and middle income Minnesota residents. The program serves Pell eligible students from Minnesota, combining federal, state,and institutional grants to cover a high portion of students cost of attendance, up to 100% of tuition and required student service fees for high EFC students

UMM offers a tuition waiver for American Indian students, mandated in federal and Minnesota laws rooted in founding of the campus in the late 1800s as an American Indian boarding school.
","Given our campus size and demographics -- and the responsibility of campus faculty to do academic advising, the faculty routinely consult with the financial aid office to answer questions low-income students may have.

A number of faculty and staff are themselves first generation college students, many from low-income backgrounds who are attracted to the campus mission and vision. These staff serve as role models and mentors for low-income students.  Faculty members work closely with students as their faculty advisers and routinely consult with financial aid staff to provide the best advice and support for low-income students. Workshops are provided to help faculty advisers understand the potential impact on financial aid package when students change their credit load during the semester.

Additionally, Morris has a master advisor program which provides extra training for some faculty advisors to better serve our low-income students.","More than half of UMM’s students of color are from low income backgrounds, compared to one in three Caucasian students.

The program has shown great success in supporting the retention of participating students, many of whom are low-income and first-generation students, early in their college experience. Participants’ first and second-year retention rates are consistently above other students of color and for some cohorts above the student population as a whole.

About 79.8% of our undergraduate students receive some financial assistance based on demonstrated need. The University also allocates institutional funds to be offered to students as merit-based awards. In 2013-2014, Mount Union undergraduate students received financial aid in excess of $56,175,594. More than $ 26,138,562 of that total was awarded in the form of institutional grants or scholarships.","Student Affairs has an entire office (The Center for Student Success) that provides a wide variety of services to students in academic need, and they do (through Admissions) create a profile for each student that helps to predict academic success. (They can tell you more about the approaches to help “fragile freshmen.”) But to my knowledge, there are no programs specifically designed to target non-traditional or low-income students.

The Center established a ‘Success Coach’ program for minority and at risk students.   Center staff meet with select students on a bi weekly basis and facilitate time management, study strategies, and accountability issues.  We also assist them with finding their major, resume construction, and job search skills and strategies.  The students complete a learning style assessment and tips for academic success.  We(the student and coach) keep a handbook to track improvement and meeting notes.  

Career Development also facilitates career and job search processes for non-traditional students and alumni.  We participate in job fairs (My Workster) just for seasoned alumni.
","With funds from the Bremer Foundation, Mount Union began the Great Expectations Program in 1995.  This program involves identifying a cohort of middle school students from Youngstown OH to participate in Early Intervention Programming continuing to the end of their high school career.  The focus is to prepare students from low income backgrounds for higher education.  Programming, which continues through the generous support of the Marion G. Resch Foundation, includes a summer enrichment camp, regular visits with the students in the hs setting, and weekend sessions focusing on academic enrichment, cultural experiences, critical thinking, personal development, ACT prep, career exploration, college preparation and community service.  The Great Expectations Program is currently with our fifth cohort of students. 

The Dowling Mentor Program
The program is nearly 30 years old and was founding in honor of Robert Dowling who was a teacher in Alliance.  We focus on mentoring students in grades 7-12 at Alliance High School.  The students are chosen by the principal and guidance counselors and spend one on one time with a Mount Union student and participate in monthly group outings.","We have recently partnered with Alliance City School District and are in the inaugural year of the Investment Alliance scholarship program.  Beginning with the May 2014 graduating class of Alliance High School, the top fifteen ranked students will be offered full tuition to Mount Union.  This community collaboration is intended to prevent brain drain and offer our brightest local students the opportunity to attend Mount Union without concern about financial constraint.  

We also continue our long-standing commitment to the Minority Achievement Award Competition which supports our diversity and access initiatives.  Annually, students compete for scholarships ranging from $ 3,000 to $ 14,000 per year.  The traditional program involves a campus-based interview and essay but our approach is flexible enough to permit phone based interviewing when a visit to campus is cost prohibitive.
","Admission and Student Financial Services has programs in place to guide parents through the admission and financial aid experience including one called ""College Knowledge,"" which is only for parents.  While our programs are not solely for parents of low-income students, it is critical that we design these programs with those parents in mind, as well as with first generation families in mind.  

We also proactively drive our parents of admitted students to scheduled appointments with financial aid staff to review financial aid awards and we do so by reaching out, literally, to every parent of an admitted student.  We present this as a normal step in the college-going process with the intent of eliminating barriers because families without a college-going history are often hesitant or embarrassed to ask questions.  We also offer extended office hours and established Saturday hours during peek seasons in order to accommodate parents whose work situations do not allow for conversation during our traditional business hours.  Most importantly, we have a robust and proactive system in place to conduct after-hours telephone appointments in order to alleviate travel costs and accommodating working parents from all walks of life.  

Preview for Parents
We don’t have programs specifically for parents of low-income students. However, we do offer a family program at Preview, and at that we introduce them to many resources on campus. We do this throughout the weekend, but also specifically during the University 101 sessions designed to introduce them to various offices on campus. ","Our admission efforts include the funding of targeted groups of students from designated urban high school settings in an effort to increase access and diversity.  We visit high schools in urban centers as standard practice within our admission travel season.  We participate in a variety of college access fairs and events that are specifically designed to increase college going rates among low income and underrepresented students.  We allocate a specific portion of our budget to fund groups for college-exposure visits.  We also have an admission representative position on our staff which is titled ""Coordinator of Multicultural Recruitment"" in order to build access efforts as well. ","There is no fee to apply for admission to Mount Union.  Additionally, our deposit is not due until May 1 but should a student deposit prior to that time, it is fully refundable until May 1.  This is important as it leaves time for students to see financial aid packages from other institutions with the most flexibility and without cost to them.

Mount Union also participates with four Stark County partner schools in offering dual credit coursework to students still in high school.  We currently offer pre calc, Calc I, Colonial American History and Western Civ.  These students are able to earn Mount Union credits while in high school and those credits can be used here or at any institution which accepts college transfer credit.  
",,"In addition to need-based financial aid, there are two programs in place to assist students with financial obstacles and help to promote academic success.  First, students have the opportunity to obtain interest-free book loans to aid with purchase of textbooks and other class materials.  The loans are expected to be repaid prior to the end of the semester in which those monies are allocated—however, if students are unable to repay within such time schedule, then the loan balance is added to their student account.  Secondly, on an individual basis, students have the potential to obtain emergency personal loans to help deal with crises and unexpected needs in their lives.  As with book loans, emergency loans are repayable or can be added to student account.

It guarantees 100 percent of the demonstrated need of students admitted to the University. This important program allows U.Va. to operate with a “need-blind” admission policy that bolsters efforts to attract the best students here and achieve socioeconomic diversity in the student population. AccessUVa, recently modified as the Affordable Excellence program, offers caps on need-based loans for all other students, and a commitment to meet 100 percent of demonstrated need for every student. The Affordable Excellence program reduces need-based indebtedness – low-income Virginians who earn a degree from the University would accrue a maximum of $4,000 in need-based student loans over a four-year period. With the changes to AccessUVA approved in 2013, low-income students would accrue a maximum of $14,000 in need-based debt over four years.  Under the new plan, this total will decrease need-based debt by $10,000. Additionally, under the new program, middle-income Virginians would accrue a maximum of $18,000 in need-based student loans over a four-year period, down from $28,000. AccessUVA not only keeps a U.Va. education affordable for the lowest income students, but also addresses the concerns of middle-income families who are squeezed by the rising cost of tuition. By limiting debt — or eliminating it altogether, in the case of students with the most need — AccessUVa offers assurance to prospective students that if they make the grade, they can afford to attend the University. http://www.virginia.edu/financialaid/access.php",N/A,The newly formed Blue Ridge Scholars Program offers programming for low-income students in addition to financial aid.,"The University offers a number of privately endowed need-based scholarship and grant funds administered by Student Financial Services.

Ridley Scholarship, ROTC Scholarships, and the University Achievement Award, among others.

To qualify for any University endowed or restricted scholarships, students must demonstrate outstanding academic achievement, have financial need, and meet all federal and University eligibility requirements. In most instances, students do not need to complete a separate application form but are considered automatically.

If a student and/or family has a change in financial circumstances, such as a loss of income or increased expenses, individual circumstances may be considered in the re-evaluation of financial aid eligibility. In some cases, the Financial Aid Office may be able to adjust income information based on these “special circumstances.” Students and/or their families may also experience increased mandatory expenses, such as additional medical/dental/disability expenses, required educational expenses, and/or transportation expenses, etc. In some cases, the Financial Aid Office may be able to adjust the student’s estimated Cost of Attendance (COA) based on these “special circumstances” as well. 

The state maintains 13 UW College campuses to serve as low-cost 2-year campuses with the goal of transferring to 4-year campuses like UW Oshkosh.  Cost savings are a major justification for attendance at a UW College.  UW Oshkosh works with UW System to maximize transfer of credits from UW Colleges.  UW Oshkosh also works with the state Technical colleges to develop transfer agreements and 2+2 programs for student wishing to transfer.

","The Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) sponsors workshops and sessions to assist faculty members in understanding the developmental needs of first-year students and specialized populations.

Students must meet prescribed eligibility criteria relating to family economic status and/or parental education attainment. Students with documented disabilities may also be served by the program. 

UW Oshkosh is the largest recipient of transfer students in the UW System.  A common reason for transfer is a financial strategy of using non-residential UW Colleges and Technical colleges to accumulate one to several semesters of credits at reduced expense.  The campus recently opened the Titan Transfer Center to assist students in their integration into the University through an augmented student transfer advising process. This will allow transfer students to become better aware of University academic and student support services.

The likelihood about any student having to leave b/c of financial reasons is slim or none.  

Williams meets 100% of demonstrated financial need, even for the neediest students.  Williams has a zero loan policy for students from families with incomes below $75,000 which enables low-income students to graduate with little if any student loan debt.  Though our maximum loan debt is $16,000 after four years, many students are eligible for a reduced loan expectation if their parent contribution is below $20,000.  Further, students with parent contributions below $4,000 are eligible for a Health Insurance Grant to cover the cost of state mandated health insurance coverage and lower student summer savings expectations - and all students eligible for aid receive a book grant to cover the full cost of required texts and course reading packets thereby exempting them from any out-of-pocket costs for reading materials.","Development of Teaching in the Diverse Classroom – professional development for faculty members – emerged last year.

The Williams College Financial Literacy website was created and is currently managed by the Financial Literacy Committee. The FinLit Committee is a collaboration between the Dean’s Office, Student Life, Financial Aid, Human Resources, Learning in Action, Special Academic Programs, and others on campus. Our goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible resources to help all students improve their money management skills and overall financial well-being at Williams and beyond.  http://sites.williams.edu/finlit/about/","Williams meets 100 percent of every student’s demonstrated financial need. We look carefully at a variety of information to determine how much you and your family should be able to contribute to the cost of your education, and then we subtract that from the amount it will cost you to attend Williams to figure out how much financial assistance you need.

Your aid package will also include your expected earnings from a campus job and summer employment, and it may include a modest student loan. We won’t expect you to borrow more than $4,000 a year (though some families opt to).

Williams Grant: Awarded based on need, this grant covers 85 percent of the average financial aid package.

Williams Book Grant: All applicants who qualify for aid receive a book grant that covers the actual cost of ALL required textbooks, course packets, and studio art fees taken for academic credit during the fall and spring semester(s) when in residence.  Winter Study costs, including books, are handled separately.

The new Financial Aid website was built focusing on ease of navigation.  It includes a glossary http://finaid.williams.edu/glossary/","Though multi-layered, the Admission Office’s strategy for low-income largely centers on two main components: the Windows on Williams (WOW) fall fly-in program, and a formal relationship with QuestBridge, a national non-profit organization.  

Every fall, we invite roughly 150 low-income and first-generation college students for an all-expense-paid three day and two night visit to campus for WOW.  WOW affords prospective students an opportunity to sit-in on classes, meet faculty and staff, attend admission and financial aid workshops, stay in a dormitory, and ultimately, experience Williams first-hand.  Though we hope students will apply and subsequently matriculate as Williams students, the scope of presentation for WOW students differs from the standard model for the typical Williams prospective student;, given the socioeconomic background of most WOW students, we serve primarily as de facto college counselors for this constituency rather than admission officers presenting a “hard-sell” of Williams College.  In creating a counselor oriented relationship with these students, we are able to maintain contact with them throughout the application process, providing multiple opportunities for contact that are not explicitly Williams focused.  The goodwill created from these efforts often results in yielding a high percentage of WOW applicants who apply for first-year admission and are admitted.

This year, we began the WOW recruitment process earlier than ever in the hopes to extend the relationship with low-income and first-generation students into the summer preceding their senior year.  The majority of this year’s WOW attendees have also been notified of their selection earlier than ever (late July as opposed to early September in the past).  Points of contact for these students have extended beyond the admission staff to current students as well, who are able to provide insight into life at a liberal arts college, and Williams in particular, via email or phone.

Our relationship with QuestBridge is also integral insofar as it allows us to reach a broader range of low-income prospective students than would be possible otherwise.  Every summer, Questbridge sends us a database of roughly 5,000 rising seniors, the majority of whom are low-income or first-generation.  Of the 5,000 names we receive, roughly 10 to 20% are competitive for admission to Williams.  These students, as selected by the diversity recruitment director, are then sent correspondence encouraging them to apply to the WOW program.  Though we receive WOW applications from other venues, including but not limited to College Board searches, community based organizations (CBO’s), high schools, and other organizations work with, a noticeable portion of the WOW applicant pool are affiliated with QuestBridge.
","Williams is a proud QuestBridge partner. QuestBridge is a non-profit organization committed to expanding opportunity in higher education to highly motivated, academically talented, low-income, and underserved youth in America. Our partnership with QuestBridge builds upon a longstanding commitment to making a Williams education available to and affordable for America’s best students, regardless of their financial situation.

Over the course of our eight year partnership with QuestBridge, Williams is thrilled to have welcomed more than 250 QuestBridge Scholars and Finalists to our community.
