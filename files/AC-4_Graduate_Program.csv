It is for students who seek licensure in the profession and is accredited by the National Architecture Accrediting Board (NAAB).

Our college is listed among ""America's World-Class Schools of Architecture"" by Design Intelligence, ranked in the top 10 nationally for our work in digital design and fabrication and our commitment to social justice by Architect magazine, and nationally known for our leadership in sustainability.

With two options, our graduate degree is for those committed to developing—with faculty and fellow students—the attitudes, skill, and methods needed to work as an architect in support of the sustainability of a built environment of the highest quality.

We see the built field—and architecture as part of it—as an embodiment of culture in all its diversity and complexity. It is in constant flux while adhering to an underlying coherence. The built field consists of both ordinary and special buildings. Spaces found in built fields span time and space from dense urban agglomerations to the most rural settlements.

The evolution of the built field—depending on both convention and invention for its sustenance—is guided by professionals from a wide range of disciplines, including architects, engineers, planners, as well as public officials, corporate leaders, product manufacturers, and everyday users.

In light of these realities, and because we expect our graduates to engage in diverse forms of local and global practice during their careers, we challenge students with knowledge both new and old. We stress how to learn and how to design, incorporating the methods that constitute the profession’s shared body of knowledge.

Because we respect the lessons practice offers, we emphasize the idea of the reflective and global practitioner as a conceptual framework linking our teaching in classrooms and studios, and a variety of immersive learning experiences away from the campus.

Given this viewpoint, a distinct part of our program is a required academic internship experience of at least 14 weeks following the framework articulated by National Council of Architectural Registration Board’s Intern Development Program (IDP) for architectural licensing. Students who have already fulfilled the academic internship requirement prior to enrollment in the program,  may pursue more internship experience or utilize study away experiences including the following options:

•	Foreign travel and study in one of Ball State's foreign study centers or with cooperating institutes and universities in the United States and around the world
•	On-campus immersive and experiential learning experiences such as the Virginia Ball seminar
•	Another distinct component of our program is the opportunity to embark on one of several certificate programs offered within the College of Architecture and Planning and in the university at large.

We welcome students from around the world—of all ages, races, and backgrounds—who wish to work with us on the vital issues and opportunities that face the profession as it seeks to contribute to improving our manmade environment.

",http://www.extension.harvard.edu/degrees-certificates/sustainability-environmental-management,Master in Design Studies: Energy and Environments,"The existing discourse on “sustainable” design inadequately frames questions of energy and environment. Whether you consider the narrowly defined system boundaries of buildings or landscapes, incomplete interpretations of the thermodynamics that support life today, or the externalities of contemporary “sustainability,” a more ambitious and totalizing praxis for energy and environments is necessary today. The Energy and Environments concentration focuses on buildings and landscapes as both small and large-scale thermodynamic systems that aim to maximize energy intake, use, and feedback, achieving broad design and ecological impacts. For instance, the design of urban wood buildings has far-reaching effects on forestry practices, global carbon cycles, as well as minute thermal phenomena. Rather than focusing on the constrained principles of efficiency, conservation, and optimization, we examine the capacities and propensities of material/energy systems along with their historical and socio-ecological entanglements. This approach is necessary for a more thermodynamically cogent, ecologically exuberant, and vitally civilizing method of practice for the 21st century.

Energy and Environments allows students to examine material and energy issues – broadly defined, from the molecular to the territorial – across disciplines and scales, taking full advantage of courses and initiatives throughout the GSD and Harvard University. It is closely associated with the Energy, Environments, and Design Research Lab, a way to couple theory with applied research. The curriculum is diverse: from short workshops, half-semester module courses, regular seminars and lectures, and to year-long thesis projects and multi-year lab projects.",http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/academic-programs/master-in-design-studies/energy-and-environments/index.html,"Harvard School of Engineering & Applied Sciences - Graduate Engineering Sciences Degree: Environmental Science and Engineering (S.M., M.E., Ph.D)","Our society’s influence on the natural world’s ecosystems and resources has never been more prominent or problematic than it is today.

",http://esd.mit.edu/academics/sm.html,PhD in Engineering Systems,"ESD's doctoral students are leaders in the evolution of engineering systems approaches—committed to thinking imaginatively about ways to broaden engineering's scope to solve complex problems. In the course of their studies, students acquire broad knowledge of the field of engineering systems and deep knowledge of a domain and of a methodology. By the time a student defends his or her thesis, he or she has conducted original scholarship on complex technical systems, advancing either theory, policy, or practice.

As with the Engineering Systems Division as a whole, the research done by students in the doctoral program can be categorized into several broad areas, including energy and sustainability, extended enterprises, health care delivery, and critical infrastructures, among others. Students use approaches that examine the interface of humans and technology or that measure, model, and mitigate the effects of uncertainty. Students work to improve the design and implementation of large, complex systems.

The exponentially rising demands that human populations make on natural resources and ecological systems that supply us with energy, food, water and many other ecosystem services will be further threatened by climate change and the pollution of air, soil and water. Continued reliance on a “business as usual” approach to the economic production and consumption of goods and services, often characterized by the stresses it places on The Commons and by a disregard for environmental and social justice, now threatens the ability of the natural world to absorb our collective impact, erodes our collective security, and polarizes our societies.  Substantial changes in social contracts, economic systems, as well as individual and institutional behaviors will be needed to provide more sustainable, healthy and secure societies. National, regional and local experimentation is needed to find solutions to societal challenges.

This Master of Arts/Science in Interdisciplinary Studies: Concentration in Sustainability program is an initiative of the University of Louisville’s Sustainability Council which seeks to integrate sustainability into everything that goes on at UofL. Students in the program are encouraged to contribute to the Sustainability Council’s efforts to explore sustainable solutions for UofL and our community.

Students are required to complete 33 credit hours of courses.  These include 3 credit hours of an Introduction to Sustainability course (SUST 600) taken by all students, 3 credit hours per course in each of three Core Areas (total of 9 credit hours), 3 credit hours in either research methods or statistics needed to conduct research in their focus area, 6 credit hours in either Thesis work or Portfolio, and the remaining 12 credit hours as electives in their area of concentration.  A thesis is required to complete the MS option. The electives will be approved by the student's thesis committee and it is strongly suggested that at least one elective be in a core area that is not in the student's home department. The thesis or portfolio options will be determined by the student's career focus and goals and by the advisory committee's recommendation. Thesis and portfolios must involve work in at least two of the Core Areas listed below in order to be considered interdisciplinary.

There will be a minimum of 12 hours apportioned as follows: All students are required to take a 3 credit Introduction to Sustainability course (SUST 600). All students must also take one course from the listings in each of the three Core Areas, for a minimum of 9 credit hours. These Core Areas are The Built Environment, The Natural Environment and The Social Environment.  These core courses will have been accepted as providing a broad scope and foundation for all students and do not specify pre-requisites. After reviewing the syllabi of environmentally-related courses in many departments at the university for their potential to fulfill this objective, the committee reached a consensus on the courses below for these Core Areas.  Additional courses meeting the above criteria may have to be developed to provide more offerings each semester, since some of the courses below are not offered every semester.  Some elective courses are currently not offered at the 600-level, but could be by requiring additional graduate level work. These courses should also be co-listedas SUST courses.

Upon entry, all students will take an Introduction to Sustainability course (SUST 600) to ensure, regardless of their subsequent focus, shared exposure to and basic interdisciplinary knowledge of three Core Areas of Sustainability. This cross-cutting introductory course will be offered each semester and its content will require development.",http://louisville.edu/upa/programs/master-of-interdisciplinary-studies-in-sustainability,--,,--,--,,--,,--,--,,--,--,,--,--,,--,,"Additionally, graduate students at UofL have the following options to pursue sustainability-related degrees:

The Department's mission and goals stem from its vision.

The UW Oshkosh MSW has four Goals:
    Prepare advanced degree social workers to assume leadership roles in clinical/mental health care and health care settings in order to meet the growing needs of the Fox Valley and beyond.
    Prepare professional social workers to engage in activities that will contribute to the development and improvement of social policy at local, regional, state, and national levels as it pertains to culturally relevant mental health and health care services.
    Engage in collaborative partnerships with other academic units and degree programs at UW Oshkosh, as well as with organizational entities in the Fox Valley region in order to improve community well being.
    Engage in teaching, research, and evaluation activities that promote best practices in mental health and health care practice and encourage innovation and discovery to improve the well being of those in need.
