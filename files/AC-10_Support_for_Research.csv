One of the primary duties of a Juniata College faculty member is professional development, “the growth in competence as a teacher which follows from a continuing and lively pursuit of scholarly interests” (§ 2.9.5). Normally, evidence of professional development is provided by scholarly or creative activity that is recognized by professional colleagues outside the institution. Professional development enhances and acknowledges the expertise of the faculty member, enriches the classroom, and increases the visibility of Juniata College. Faculty members should involve Juniata students in their professional activities, either directly (by engaging with students in scholarship) or indirectly (by providing students opportunities to witness the practice of scholarly endeavors), and should act as professional role models for their students. Professional development includes, but is not limited to, the following activities:

A. Individual or collaborative research, writing, or artistic production as recognized by experts in the particular field;

B. Participation in professional meetings, especially by presenting peer-reviewed papers or
posters, presenting workshops, or serving as a panel member or discussant;

Faculty approved change to (B) December 3, 2008

C. Board membership or consulting, where participation reflects the candidate’s standing as
an expert in the field;

D. Published reviews of the work of other scholars in the field;

E. Invited testimony before government bodies as an expert in the field;

F. Grant applications and funding for research from outside sources;

G. Research on the scholarship of teaching and learning;

H. Mastery of a field significantly outside the candidate’s previous training and experience
(see § 2.5.1.1) to prepare and teach courses in support of departmental or college-wide
priorities;

For FY15, $21,600 was made available for Project Grants plus an additional $10,000 for Professional Development Grants.  SSI also offers a Wage Grant program, with a budget of $24,000, which directly supports undergraduates and graduates student employment.  Grants are available to students in any major.  

During FY15, SSI's research grant program was fully established and focused on pairing undergraduate students with researchers via cooperative student-faculty Sustainability Research Grants. SSI established this program to support student research with an applied focus to encourage change in our own community. In line with the SSI’s vision, applications must advance a culture of sustainability at OSU through action, education, and opportunity. Preference is given to proposals that clearly impact the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of the Corvallis campus. $10,000 were available for research grants in FY15. 

All grant funded work must benefit OSU students and SSI's mission ""to advance student efforts in creating a culture of sustainability at OSU through action, education, and opportunity.""",http://sli.oregonstate.edu/ssi/grants/research-grants,True,"OSU led in the formation of Oregon BEST (Oregon Built Environment & Sustainable Technologies Center).  An independent, nonprofit organization established by the Oregon Legislature, Oregon BEST builds on Oregon’s reputation as a national innovator in sustainability, natural resources, the sustainable built environment, and clean energy.

Oregon BEST's charter is to help Oregon businesses compete globally by transforming and commercializing university research into new technologies, services, products, and companies — all of which translate into new jobs for Oregon’s green economy. 

Oregon BEST focuses on the following two strategic areas:

    * Sustainable Built Environment Products and Services
    * Renewable Energy Generation

Oregon BEST ensures Oregon is a global leader in the green economy. More than 190 Oregon BEST Member Faculty at four universities offer a shared-user network of research expertise and lab tools that help Oregon companies, universities, and students succeed.

PROPOSAL MATCHING PROGRAM

Oregon BEST's Proposal Matching Program provides matching funds to research and equipment acquisition proposals seeking competitive external funding. This program leverages the state's investment in renewable energy and green building research by making proposals from Oregon faculty more competitive and increasing the level of outside funding of these areas.

COMMERCIALIZATION GRANT PROGRAM

The Oregon BEST Commercialization Grant Program accelerates the commercialization of technologies developed by universities and small businesses in Oregon collaborating with Oregon BEST’s member faculty.

RESEARCH FACILITY INVESTMENTS

Oregon BEST invests strategically in university research facilities that advance Oregon BEST's mission of economic development and job creation through research and development of sustainable built environment and renewable energy technologies from the Oregon University System (OUS). These investments help Oregon's research faculty, clean-tech industry, and students gain access to cutting-edge research tools and expertise.

Oregon BEST has made facilities investments in seven Oregon BEST Signature Research Facilities that form a statewide network of shared-user facilities. This network represents almost $5 million in new lab resources brought online by Oregon BEST since early 2009 that are available to Oregon faculty and industry. The seven Oregon BEST Signature Research Facilities include:

The link below summarizes the many Green Fund Grant projects funded to date (some of which are simply sustainability projects, while others also involve a sustainability research component).

Another vehicle supporting student research in sustainability are several $1,000 fellowship grants provided by a local business and funded through SRU's Sustainable Enterprise Accelerator (SEA) to support sustainable projects and research. 

The SEA also receives grants from other nonprofit organizations to support projects involving sustainability research, such as the current aquaponics demonstration and research project. This project involves the design, construction and operation of an aquaponics system located at the Macoskey Center and intended to document/research productivity of the system, in which tilapia are raised in one water tank, with their waste used as nutrient piped by gravity flow to a second hydroponic tank in which swiss chard will be grown. The system is purported to produce twice the vegetative matter using only 10% of the water used by conventional gardening techniques. Lessons learned and the actual production results obtained are being researched and documented to aid a small village in Uganda to replicate the system, where both tilapia and swiss chard are cash crops with high nutritional value for the villagers. The system has been constructed and uses a photovoltaic panel to power a small recirculation pump; during Spring semester 2016, the system will be stocked with tilapia and production of swiss chard will begin.

We are currently being funded through the UT Division of Water Quality to monitor shorebird eggs for both selenium and mercury contamination in Gilbert Bay of Great Salt Lake.  USGS funded us to address the same questions at Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge.  Kennecott is funding us to study the potential environmental impacts to wetland bird populations if/when their tailings facility is expanded.  CH2MHill, a consulting firm, hired us to examine bird use along the Kennecott tailings drain.  The tailings drain has high concentrations of selenium and thus can potential impact shorebird reproduction if they are found nesting at the site. We were funded last year to examine how and where Snowy Plovers use the US Magnesium facility on the west side of the lake.  That site is a candidate for listing as a Superfund site due to PCB and dioxin contamination.  Finally, we are completing a multi-year study looking at the eutrophication of Farmington Bay.  Sewage effluent and its high nutrient content has resulted in Farmington Bay being considered as an impaired water body by the US EPA.  Consequently, we are conducting a multi-site study to compare the effects on the productivity, diets and condition of waterfowl, and shorebirds using this wetland.  This study has been supported by a number of different entities including US EPA, UT Div of Water Quality but most recently by South Davis Sewer District.
