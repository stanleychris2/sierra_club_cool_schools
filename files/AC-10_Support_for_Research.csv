In addition, the college offers numerous summer research scholarships in both the sciences and humanities - many of which end of going to students doing sustainability research.",http://denison.edu/academics/research,--,,http://denison.edu/academics/provost/professional-development/professional-development,True,"Scholarship and creative achievements are both valuable in their own right and instrumental to good teaching. Scholarly achievements are not only measures of a faculty member's continuing involvement in a field of study or artistic endeavor, but also sources of curricular strength and renewal for the institution. Engaging in scholarship is vital to the continued intellectual and professional growth of a faculty member. Scholarship is also vital to teaching because it informs the subject matter of courses and establishes the faculty member as a model from whom students learn.

The candidate's body of scholarship should flow from a vision of scholarly growth which should be discussed in the professional statement. This body of scholarship should reflect a degree of originality in the generation, application, or reinterpretation of concepts, methods, or creative works. The body of scholarship should reflect the activity of an informed and lively intellect and talent that may be read with interest by the candidate's peers beyond Denison and possibly employed in their own work. The issues addressed should be important ones, and the contributions candidates make to their field should be significant and intellectually sound.

A successful candidate for tenure will be expected to have demonstrated a sustained scholarly effort, as well as scholarly ability by producing a professionally reviewed body of scholarship in the form of publication, performance, exhibition, or other final form usual to the discipline. Evidence may include the continuation or completion of scholarly activity that was begun prior to the candidate's employment at Denison; however, there must be a clear demonstration of continued scholarly activity, growth, and productivity while a faculty member at Denison. The tenure review process includes an evaluation of the candidate's scholarship or creative work done by persons not associated either with the candidate or with Denison.

Candidates for reappointment at the third year must demonstrate progress toward meeting the above standard for tenure at the sixth year. Works in progress beyond the dissertation may be sufficient to demonstrate progress toward tenure at the time of the third year review, but are not in themselves adequate for tenure.

Professionally reviewed scholarship and creative works are the most important indicators of scholarly achievement and are essential for tenure. Examples of these may include: scholarly articles, monographs, book chapters; published short stories, poetry, and novels; translations, critical editions, and interpretive anthologies and textbooks; published or recorded music; performances and exhibitions; original work in performing, dramatic, or visual arts; original computer software; and peer reviewed grant proposals.

Other forms of scholarship and creative works may be reported as additional evidence of scholarly activity, for example: book reviews; technical reports from consulting projects; papers presented at professional meetings; and non-peer reviewed grant proposals.

These examples are neither all-inclusive nor exclusive. In every instance, the quality and extent of the scholarship or creative works are most important.

Contributions to the Other Purposes of the College. 

As a residential liberal arts college dedicated to educating the whole person, Denison depends upon its faculty to contribute to the life of the College not only as teacher/scholars but also as members of the community. In the extent and quality of their contributions to the College, faculty serve as models for colleagues and students of civic engagement, promote participation in thoughtful public discourse, and exemplify the ability to see individual and departmental interests through the lens of institutional needs. These other contributions to the College have the effect of increasing the overall sense of connectedness within the community: connecting students to the College, colleagues to one another, and the College to the larger world of academe. In doing so, they strengthen the community and promote both unity and diversity. For these reasons, other contributions to the College constitute a third and important criterion for contract reappointment, tenure, and promotion.

Faculty members are expected to engage in ongoing service to the College, which may include service to the discipline or the profession. This service should expand in breadth and depth throughout the career in ways that complement the unique talents of the faculty member. Thus, while the beginnings of a record of service would suffice for reappointment, a more significant record of service would be expected for tenure, and an even more significant record of service would be expected for promotion to professor.

These contributions may take many forms. Active engagement with the department and the College are expected of all colleagues. For this reason, all faculty members are expected to attend department meetings and meetings of the College faculty. Faculty serve their departments in such ways as participating on departmental committees, participating in faculty searches, serving as department chair, advising departmental student groups, and attending and participating in other departmental events. Faculty are expected to contribute to the College in such ways as serving on committees in the governance system, serving on ad hoc committees and task forces, serving on interdisciplinary program committees, attending and participating in admissions events, advising student organizations, and representing the College in various consortial roles, such as on GLCA committees. Faculty members also serve their disciplines and the profession in such ways as serving on editorial boards, prize committees, and review boards and serving in leadership roles in professional organizations. Faculty also serve their communities in such ways as holding elected office and serving on the boards of community agencies and non-profits. Such community service is particularly valued when colleagues lend their professional expertise to help meet civic needs.

Bass Connections is a university-wide initiative, funded by a $50 million grant, providing students (undergraduate and graduate) with greater exposure to inquiry across the disciplines, partnership with unlikely fellow thinkers, sustained mentorship in teams, and the chance to experience the intersections of the academy and the broader world. All Bass Connections participants will experience the complexity of global, societal problems in their real-world form, the value of integrating bodies of specialized knowledge, and the imperative of teamwork to begin finding solutions to the most pressing problems of the day. The interdisciplinary nature of these teams leads to strong ties to sustainability in project themes:

Brain & Society: Many of the core problems of our time – climate change, financial crises, addiction, and social inequality – arise from individuals and their choices. Brain research on cognition, emotions, expression, and decision-making will be translated in this theme to address collective challenges and increase understanding of what makes us human. Curricular and project elements will build connections between basic research in neuroscience (and related biological sciences) and socially challenging questions in medicine, the humanities, public policy, economics, ethics, and law, to understand issues such as physical and social responses to transformative events; the workings of the brain in rhetoric and the arts; memory in legal testimony; and the role of decision processes in shaping our institutions and public policies. Project deliverables will be diverse, including, but not limited to: co-authored articles, artistic solutions, policy briefs, smartphone applications, curricula, and community outreach programs.

Global Health: Through Bass Connections in Global Health, students – undergraduate through doctoral – have the opportunity to participate in courses, experiential learning and faculty-led field projects to find solutions to global health challenges. Its education programs and activities help develop participants’ ability to work creatively and collectively to address health disparities worldwide, and cultivate strong mentoring, research and teaching skills of graduate and professional students, and postdoctoral scholars.

Energy: Bass Connections in Energy capitalizes on the University’s broader Energy Initiative, a university-wide interdisciplinary collaboration addressing today’s pressing energy challenges related to the economy, the environment, and security. Projects include research on energy communication, the intersection of energy & peace-building, energy efficiency in industry, distributed solar for Duke employees, behavior change and energy use, and the feasibility of an energy-producing digester on Duke's campus. Several of these programs are part of the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative, working to provide high-quality emissions offsets to help Duke become carbon-neutral.

Education & Human Development: Based on the recognition that successfully reaching adulthood is about more than test scores, the Bass Connections Education & Human Development (EHD) theme encompasses an interdisciplinary framework to engage students and faculty to develop the data, tools, and practices that better link how we raise our children—in schools, in families, and in communities—to positive life outcomes in an interconnected global society. We see “education” not just as formal K-12 schooling but also as learning via families and social channels, and “human development” as encompassing valued life outcomes across ages including health, social and familial connections, happiness, income, and employment.

2. Graduate student fellowships in the Duke Center for Sustainability & Commerce: Each spring the Duke Center for Sustainability & Commerce accepts applications, and conducts interviews, with exceptional Duke graduate students from across the campus who wish to obtain fellowship status with the Center. Under the direction of Director Jay Golden and affiliated faculty, fellows are tasked with sustainability research projects and take on leadership roles that include coordinating our student led Innovation Awards Program and Thought Leader Seminar Series. The Center places graduate-level multidisciplinary student teams, trained in sustainable systems and life cycle analytics, with organizations to help them address real-world sustainability issues.

",--,True,"Emory offers all faculty financial support for research through the University Research Committee.
The URC is a standing committee of the Faculty Council of the University Senate and awards competitive small research grants, especially in fields for which there is little or no external funding or to explore new areas of research that are likely to attract outside support. All regular, full-time faculty members of the University are eligible and proposals are reviewed by five broad discipline-based subcommittees.  Sustainability-related projects have been awarded from this fund. http://www.urc.emory.edu/about/index.html 

The Center for Faculty Development and Excellence, an office of the Provost, offers small grants to support Academic Learning Communities that foster faculty collaboration and often lead to future research efforts.  Currently, CFDE has supported work in both Climate Change and Sustainable Food Studies areas.  Also available are mini-grants to support engaged scholarship in teaching which have been used by faculty for sustainability-related efforts.  The CFDE has a focus on Public Scholarship, and it also supports faculty with subvention funds for publication.  http://cfde.emory.edu/index.html 

The Office of Sustainability Initiatives provides an Incentives Fund to support research, campus-based projects, and the development of new rituals to promote sustainability on Emory’s campuses. All faculty, staff and students, including Emory Healthcare and Oxford College members are eligible to apply. Funds may be used for supplies, materials, publicity, and travel costs (excluding equipment). Proposals are welcome in all areas, with priority given to proposals in the areas of recycling, sustainable food systems, energy reduction, alternative transportation, and connection to ‘place’.  Research and rituals must be carried out on campus. http://sustainability.emory.edu/page/1036/Incentives-Fund

The Piedmont Project is a curriculum development effort that seeks to foster an invigorated intellectual community to address global issues and local environmental awareness. Faculty workshops, graduate student work, new course and module development as well as cross-disciplinary dialogue are key efforts for the project, and these sometimes result in research collaborations and grants as well as teaching innovation. http://piedmont.emory.edu/

The Center for Community Partnerships sponsors a mini-grant program for faculty, which provides financial, technical, and personnel support to faculty and staff for pilot research projects that provide a direct and tangible benefit to communities in the greater Atlanta area. While this grant does not directly specify sustainability-research, a number of grant recipients conduct research in areas of social justice, equity, and the environment. The research must be sought by one or more community organizations, government agencies, or nonprofit organizations and must have a direct and tangible benefit for or application in the community. Grants of up to $5,500 are available and awards are made three times a year. http://oucp.emory.edu/about_oucp/

The Institute of Critical International Studies helps promote Emory College's goal of global citizenship in a plural world. This goal entails scholarship and outreach to understand societies and cultures and to help reduce inequality and injustice, both across the world and in our international community at home. This mission entails recognition of and interchange with foreign scholars, students and immigrants, as well as the promotion of international scholarship and foreign experience among Emory faculty and students. http://www.icis.emory.edu/
",http://web.library.emory.edu/research-learning/index.html,True,"For promotion and tenure, scholarship is evaluated based on its advancement of knowledge and is not restricted by departmental or disciplinary boundaries. Reviews of candidates whose research is interdisciplinary tend to be expanded by seeking input from experts from multiple fields, including those outside the department or outside the school/college, as appropriate.  The promotion and tenure process has shown that Emory values and rewards research efforts that impact multiple fields and cross disciplinary boundaries. The university-wide committee that advises the president and provost on promotion and tenure issues is itself multi-disciplinary and seeks additional input in its decisions from a broad spectrum of experts to ensure that interdisciplinary research is adequately reviewed. Special mention is made of encouragement for interdisciplinary research in the Principles for Promotion and Tenure, but Emory's size and strong history of support for interdisciplinarity in hiring, retention, and funded programs speaks for itself.

The university offers two interdisciplinary majors (Urban Studies, Neuroscience).  All of these interdisciplinary minor and major programs incorporate courses whose content span traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The university supports numerous faculty who hold joint appointments in two departments. Furman’s curricular features of faculty-led travel study courses, required freshman writing and critical thinking seminars, and experiential, two-credit May Experience courses particularly lend themselves to content beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.

Memos to faculty candidates for tenure and promotion as well as to department chairs submitting faculty evaluations explain that “evaluations of faculty performance are based on teaching effectiveness, professional activity, and institutional service.” In the context of Furman’s academic culture of liberal learning and interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration demonstrated above, faculty reviews are undoubtedly enhanced by demonstration of cross-disciplinary work, and particularly cross-disciplinary course development and teaching.",--,True,"The Library also provides a sustainability research guide filled with useful databases for sustatinability research.

First, to graduate, every undergraduate Green Mountain College student must conduct a substantive piece of sustainability research in the capstone ELA course entitled ""A Delicate Balance"" and must earn a passing grade. The general description of this assignment is provided here:

The “Delicate Balance Project” Assignment Project Overview: The Delicate Balance project is a culminating service activity that you research, design, carry out, and write up.  The project is both scholarly and action oriented: that is, you both write a paper that supports your project and carry out the project. Required elements include:
1. Detailed Project Proposal with goals, deliverables, measurable outcomes, budget and timeline 
2. Problem/solution research paper
3. Poster Presentation
4. Final Project “Package” which includes an evaluation of its impact and of what you have learned

Project Description: This is where you are to put your well-researched ideas and idealism into action. The project is the scholarly and real-world expression of your environmental and social ethics—a public activity that addresses a genuine need in a community. You are to find a problem involving community sustainability (broadly defined), use your research skills to understand and contextualize the problem and possible solutions, and deliver a solution through civic engagement. Projects will be negotiated in class, based on your interests, goals, disciplinary skills, and the needs of the community. Past examples will be made available.

This capstone experience was described and evaluated in comparison to other approaches to capstone projects at AASHE 2015 in Minneapolis.

Second, full-time faculty can provide $500 of funding per semester to Undergraduate Research Assistants (URAs). Six out of the nine URAs in 2015 were working with faculty engaged in sustainability research.

Finally, in FY 2015, two scholarships were offered to students, for which sustainability research or sustainability projects were an important consideration in the application. These include the following:
Program: Sustainability 2020 Award
Eligibility: Awarded to students who have demonstrated excellence through past and current participation in community service, leadership roles in academic and extracurricular settings, and/or dedication to environmental practices.
Award Amount: Ranges in amount up to $7,000 per year.
How to Apply: Submit a detailed resume of community service, leadership and/or environmental advancement experience with the admissions application.
Deadline: A detailed resume or the Sustainability 2020 Award Worksheet must be submitted with the application for admission.
How to Maintain: Renewed annually as long as the student remains in good academic standing.

Program: Demonstrated Excellence in Environmental Practices Scholarship (DEEP)

",https://www.hampshire.edu/giving/ofgr.htm,True,"From the Faculty Handbook: Scholarship/Art
Sustaining the high quality, currency, and reputation of Hampshire's educational program as well as consistent excellence in teaching across the college demands a professionally active faculty. All faculty members are required to engage in scholarly/artistic activities that reach beyond the college and to produce work of high quality. Faculty members are expected to publish work in forms and forums that allow evaluation by other scholars or artists in their fields. Productions, performances, exhibitions, or other products of scholarly/artistic work that are professionally analogous to publication will be evaluated as publications when appropriately documented. In this document the terms scholarly/artistic publication or publication include these equivalents to conventional publication in cases where they are relevant to a faculty member's work. 
Hampshire encourages a range of scholarly/artistic publication that is wider than conventional disciplinary research or creative endeavor. Faculty members are encouraged to work on new questions, to use unconventional methods, to undertake interdisciplinary projects, and to expand traditional conventions. Scholarship at Hampshire includes the publication of curricular materials, such as textbooks or readers, and contributions to the scholarly literatures on pedagogy and student assessment. Publication in civic or popular forums that grows from the faculty member's intellectual work is encouraged. In addition to publication, significant components of a faculty member's scholarly record can include securing grants, professional activities in scholarly organizations, or work in the wider public community when appropriately documented and evaluated. 
Faculty members are encouraged to document the relationship between their scholarship and teaching. Scholarly work that enriches a person's teaching or expands learning opportunities for students is particularly valued at Hampshire.

The Harold F. Johnson Library supports sustainability research and learning by facilitating access to resources that critically assess the social, economic, and environmental issues that our world faces today. While the Library does not allocate a specific portion of its budget towards sustainability or sustainability research, sustainability is an integral aspect of much of the research occurring at Hampshire College. Hampshire selects books and journal subscriptions to support the curriculum, and as such provides a diverse collection aimed at supporting critical inquiry into economic, environmental, and worldly concerns. Hampshire College is the first among the Five Colleges to subscribe to Ebsco’s Sustainability Reference Center, a full-text database that covers many areas fundamental to the study of sustainability and is an essential tool in teaching. 
The Librarians also seek to inform students and faculty on the current environment of academic publishing. From engaging students with the current costs for academic publishing, and offering education into the barriers that traditional publishing enforces, the library helps develop a cadre of students who recognize the costs of the current scholarly system, and the benefits of Open Access.

The following example is taken from the Environmental Studies SAC document.

Faculty members within the Environmental Studies program have a broad range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary interests, ranging from geoscience and biology to economics, sociology, religious studies, art, and literature. As such, scholarship within Environmental Studies must be evaluated in terms of standards relevant to that individual’s disciplinary or interdisciplinary interests. If a candidate has clear disciplinary scholarship, then that person’s scholarship should be evaluated by standards typical for his/her primary disciplinary interests. However, this does not imply that a faculty member in Environmental Studies should be bound by the Standards and Criteria (SAC) of another department at HWS, as Environmental Studies professors’ research may be more interdisciplinary in nature than would be research solely acceptable by a disciplinary program. For example, an economist by training but located within the Environmental Studies program may have a more interdisciplinary research agenda and publication record than would be acceptable for the same candidate within an economics program. 

In general, the burden falls to the candidate, his/her review team, and external reviewers to frame the importance of a scholar’s research agenda and publications (or other commonly accepted forms of scholarship) from the perspective of the Environmental Studies program. This will usually require a thorough review of the candidate’s statement of scholarship and her/his scholarly materials by the external reviewers, ideally other faculty affiliated with Environmental Studies at peer institutions during Review II and Review III. It is conceivable that a faculty member within Environmental Studies might have a more disciplinary scholarship record (such as the economics professor within the program but whose research is focused on economic issues and whose publication record would be suitable for scholarship in the economics department); in this case, the candidate and review committee may agree on review of scholarship by disciplinary faculty at other schools. In selecting outside reviewers for scholarship, the Environmental Studies Program may look towards national organizations for advice and possible reviewers. These national organizations include the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE), the Council of Environmental Deans and Directors (CEED), and the North East Environmental Studies (NEES) group. These national organizations are also valuable resources for faculty in Environmental Studies.",--,--,"The HWS Warren Hunting Smith Library supports the entire curriculum of the Colleges, including sustainability research.

3.0.0.0 General Considerations for Promotion and Tenure
3.2.0.0 Collaboration: 
The College values the role of multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and/or collaborative work and recognizes that while solo work may be the primary means by which some individuals make scholarly contributions, a collaborative approach may be more appropriate for others, depending on the discipline. That being said, when a candidate is listing an accomplishment that is the product of a collaborative effort, it is incumbent upon the candidate to specify and document his/her own unique contribution to the endeavor. Conversely, departments must not discourage collaborative work merely to make evaluation of candidates easier.

3.3.0.0 Value of Community Engagement: 
The College recognizes and values the important contributions that community engagement activities offer to teaching, scholarship, and service , and it is very reasonable that such contributions be listed as accomplishments. To illustrate, one’s courses and pedagogy can incorporate community engagement. In addition, peer-reviewed scholarship can occur that focuses on, stems from, or is done in collaboration with the community. Similarly, service that links a faculty member’s courses, department, discipline, or the College with the community is also highly possible. When listing accomplishments that have a community engagement component, the candidate must be attentive to fully specifying and documenting details related to the accomplishment, regardless of the area in which these activities are aligned (teaching, scholarship, or service).

d. Contributions to the development of collaborative, interdisciplinary, or interinstitutional research programs are highly valued.  Mechanisms for evaluating such contributions may be employed. Evaluating collaborative research might involve addressing both individual contributions (e.g., quality of work, completion of assigned responsibilities) and contributions to the successful participation of others (e.g., skills in teamwork, group problem solving). 
 
f. Effective participation in disciplinary or interdisciplinary organizations’ activities should be evaluated in the context of their involvement of state-of-the-art knowledge and impact on peers and others.  For example, this participation might include serving as editor of journals or other learned publications, serving on an editorial board, chairing a program committee for a regional, national, or international meeting, or providing scholarly leadership as an officer of a major professional organization.

Evaluation of teaching and curricular contributions should not be limited to classroom activities.  It also should focus on a faculty member’s contributions to larger curricular goals (for example, the role of a course in laying foundations for other courses and its contribution to majors, or contributions to broad aspects of general education or interdisciplinary components of the curriculum).

Collection Development Librarians also order materials related to sustainability with general library funds.

The most important way that the library supports sustainability research is by providing online access to the journal literature via online databases.  Some of the most comprehensive databases such as Web of Science, Compendex for Engineering Literature, Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals, and other databases are available to Rice students and faculty.  Without these databases, research could not be done.  The library also provides access to major e-journal collections such as JSTOR, Science Direct, Wiley Blackwell, Oxford, Springer, and Project Muse.  Furthermore, if a journal article cannot be found in the Rice Library or in one of these collections, then it will be ordered from some other library (worldwide if necessary) via Interlibrary Loan.  This service is funded by the library, and is free to Rice students and faculty.

Additionally, a library guide on sustainability is in the process of being developed, and should be available by the start of the fall 2014 semester.",--,--

Multidisciplinary research is one of the central themes of the Stanford Challenge, a university-wide program introduced in 2006 to tackle the most pressing global challenges of the next century.  Through the Stanford Challenge, hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised to support multidisciplinary research, with funds going towards Professorships and Faculty Support, Programmatic and Research Support, and new multidisciplinary facilities. More than 100 new faculty positions and more than 300 new graduate fellowships were endowed.

Since 1990, Stanford has allowed selected Interdisciplinary Institutes on campus to make their own faculty appointments and promotions.  The university states, “while reaffirming the value of coupling academic appointments in policy centers and institutes to faculty appointments in existing academic departments, it was recognized that interdisciplinary policy centers may have needs not met by regular professorial appointments in existing departments.” These Interdisciplinary Institutes include the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford, the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, and the Woods Institute for the Environment.  Each of these institutes can appoint Senior Fellows and Center Fellows, both of which are members of the Academic Council, regardless of any other appointments.  These fellows can be faculty in their own department or can be completely appointed by that institute, giving institutes the freedom to promote anyone without university restrictions.

Hydrogen, biofuel, and solar energy are among the most environmentally benign alternative energy sources. To build upon our strengths and to take the existing renewable energy programs on campus to the next level of international competitiveness, the Advanced Research Initiative for Substainable Energy (ARISE) was chosen as one of the eight Initial University Multidisciplinary Research Initiatives (IUMRIs).

Texas is traditionally an energy state and Texas A&M University has been known as an energy institute as evidenced by our world class Petroleum Engineering and Nuclear Engineering programs. The energy emphasis is also reflected in the existing renewable energy programs in the University. The Advanced Research Initiative for Substainable Energy (ARISE) will build upon our strengths and take these existing renewable energy programs to the next level of international competitiveness. ARISE plans to connect the fields of technology development, academic research, commercialization, and the policy landscape in the renewable energy field. It will not only facilitate the collaboration among multidisciplinary researchers within the University, but will also help to attract funds from federal, state, and private funding agencies. 

Students are encouraged to participate in ARISE. The program builds on the proposed projects that will lead to not only scientific discovery and new technology but also pedagogical innovation for training students to become the new interdisciplinary researchers in renewable energy. This will be accomplished through developments of new interdisciplinary curricula that not only train students broadly in the science and engineering required by interdisciplinary developments, but also teach them how these challenges will impact industry, global markets, and the ever developing energy needs of other countries.

TOP grants are funded by the university to promote multidisciplinary learning experiences for Texas A&M students on a large scale. Each grant must reach at least 100 undergraduate or 50 graduate students per year. With total funding of  approximately $1M per year these are 3 year grants awarded to intercollegiate multidisciplinary groups to engage students in research based learning.  

In 2013, three grants were approved to advance sustainability:
◦	Bridging Hydrology, Governance, Culture and Scarcity for Effective Rio Grande Water Management: An Interdisciplinary Experiential Learning and Research Program
◦	Enhancing Teaching and Research in Health Impacts of Air Pollution
◦	Ecology & Evolutionary Biology

These include a providing small grants and a recognition program with regards to research on sustainability.  The Sustainability Innovation Grants program awards small grants for academically related activities.  Student can apply for these grants to provide for research expenses or to attend conferences which might aid in their research.  This grant program is also open to faculty for research or activities that augment their classes. The second way sustainability research is encouraged is via our poster session that occurs in conjunction with our Earth and Wellness Day event.  An open call goes out in early spring for students to participate in the poster session.  Students submit their sustainability related research project and the Office of Sustainability funds the cost of printing their poster, organizes the poster session and advertises it to the campus community.  The students are given the opportunity to display and discuss their research during the event which usually attracts approximately 300 campus members.
The Office of Sustainability also offers credit bearing opportunities for students to conduct sustainability research via our university wide internship program (UNI390) or community service program (RSSW credit).  These opportunities are based on individual interest.  One such example is a UNI390 Internship undertaken by a student who developed a new beverage made from the Chaga mushroom.

SOLAR DECATHLON TEAM - STUDENT COMPETITION 
UC Irvine competed in the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2015, an international student competition that challenges university students to create solar-powered houses that are cost effective, energy efficient, and attractive.  The contest highlights a range of design approaches and building technologies aimed at diverse markets, climates and regions, including urban, suburban and rural settings.  UC Irvine led Team Orange County, a joint venture with Chapman University, Irvine Valley College and Saddleback College, competing in 10 different contests ranging from architecture and engineering to home appliance performance.  Team Orange County’s entry, Casa Del Sol, was a solar-powered, zero-net-energy, multi-generational home well adapted for Southern California.  The house design promoted indoor-outdoor California lifestyle and incorporated passive solar (shading, ventilation, etc.) in addition to innovative technologies for energy management. 

The Solar Decathlon provided extensive opportunities for student involvement, leveraging UC Irvine’s research in new energy technologies, expanding its national leadership in sustainability and green technologies, accessing partnerships with local professionals, and incorporating ongoing sustainability research in engineering, physical sciences, and social sciences into the design, construction, testing, and demonstration activities for Casa Del Sol.  Student decathletes also gained significant community outreach experience, showcasing the house’s renewable energy systems and efficient technologies, products and appliances that save money and energy. 
",--,True,"OFFICE OF ACADEMIC INITIATIVES (http://www.initiatives.provost.uci.edu)
In 2014 a new campus initiative under the direction of the Vice Provost of Academic Initiatives was created to identify and support areas of interschool excellence.  Sponsored by the Office of the Provost & Executive Vice Chancellor, the Office of Academic Initiatives provides up to $150,000 annually for three years to interschool faculty teams in identified areas.  Funding may be used for specialized research partnerships, workshops or conferences, collaboration with academic units on new graduate concentrations and/or undergraduate minors, coordination of grant applications, outreach, and community engagement.  The goal of these programs is to transcend traditional academic boundaries to work productively together on projects of national significance.  Initiatives are chosen based on the possibility of achieving leadership in the proposed area, diversity of faculty participation, commitment of the leadership team, effectiveness of the plan, and likelihood of evolving into a self-sustaining activity after three years. Currently four of the eight interschool initiatives are focused on sustainability-related issues: the UCI Sustainability Initiative, OCEANS UCI, the Salton Sea Initiative, and Water UCI.
•	The UCI Sustainability Initiative provides a platform for interdisciplinary scholarship on the critical climate, environment, and resource issues confronting society.  The Initiative aims to infuse sustainability across UC Irvine, empowering students and faculty with the rich institutional history of impactful research.  The Sustainability Initiative promotes collaborations with diverse communities on and off campus in developing solutions to challenges affecting California and the globe.  Community-engaged scholarship and practice are integral to UC Irvine’s excellence as a research university and underlies how the university creates knowledge to serve society.   Initiative goals directly related to promoting faculty research in sustainability include: facilitate connection and resource sharing on and off campus; incubate new projects by faculty, staff, and student leaders; and reinforce campus efforts to inspire, enable, and evaluate public impact through interschool research, education, and engagement. Current research-related activities under the Sustainability Initiative include: the Salton Sea Initiative, the Flood-Resilient Infrastructure & Sustainable Environments (FloodRISE) project, and partnering with the School of Social Ecology to present the Toward a Sustainable 21st Century conferences series and the Empowering Sustainability program. (http://www.sustainability.uci.edu)
•	Water UCI is a campus-wide initiative that serves as a coordinating vehicle to facilitate meaningful collaborations across schools, departments, and existing research centers around questions of fundamental and applied water science, technology, management, and policy.  Focusing in the fields of fundamental and applied water science, technology, engineering, management and policy, Water UCI addresses “grand challenges” – high-consequence, high-uncertainty problems that entail unprecedented mitigation costs, have the potential to generate social conflict, and may be approaching irreversibility.  While faculty research interests embrace global as well as national aspects of these issues, Water UCI takes as a point of departure the unique expertise afforded at UC Irvine in those areas of water research that have a distinctively California focus, and for which UC Irvine has unique strengths, comparative advantages, strong experience, and great proficiency.  These issues include urban and agricultural water management, competition for increasingly scarce and over-taxed water supplies by diverse users, the food-water-energy nexus, and others.  Water UCI represents a means of enhancing faculty research in those segments of the campus that are already engaged in the investigation of water issues, and promoting further collaborations with researchers in air, energy, climate change, biodiversity, and other environmentally related areas. (http://water.uci.edu/)
•	UCI OCEANS was initiated in 2015 to build an oceans research community at UCI fostering integration and innovation and to provide an interface between UCI and ocean-related organizations, stakeholders, and publics in Orange County. The initiative encourages and supports cross-disciplinary training of UCI students at all stages working on ocean systems and marine/society interactions. Oceans are important for the Earth System but are vulnerable to human impacts such as climate change, overfishing, and pollution. Across campus, researchers at UCI are tackling pressing marine and on-shore environmental concerns and investigating questions at both global and local scales. The UCI OCEANS Initiative offers a coordinated approach to ocean research and education by embracing a vision and approach that spans the natural sciences, engineering, social science, arts, education, law, and governance and is thus distinct from other marine research institutions. With the unique collection of interdisciplinary research approaches and strong community support, UCI OCEANS is poised to become the flagship organization for urban ocean studies, while simultaneously contributing to high impact global-scale ocean research. Twenty-nine faculty from eight schools are part of this Initiative. (http://oceans.uci.edu/)
•	The Salton Sea Initiative at the UCI is a multidisciplinary group building connections among disciplines and communities concerned about the sustainability challenges facing the Salton Sea region. The Initiative acts in a variety of ways to build our understanding of the Salton Sea region, seeking out collaborations with independent researchers and government agencies to identify gaps in current knowledge and find ways to fill them. The Initiative has funded graduate student research; co-convened meetings (with USGS, IID, and the Pacific Institute) with managers, policy-makers, and scientists to address Salton Sea science; and built research and education programs from a variety of UCI departments including Humanities and Film Studies, Engineering, Social Ecology, and Biology. ( http://saltonsea.uci.edu/research/)

FACULTY CLIMATE ACTION AWARD 
The UCI Faculty Climate Action Champion Award supports one faculty member with $25,000 to carry out a project in research, education, and engagement (of students and the community) surrounding innovative programs associated with climate change, including developing, studying, and/or implementing climate-action solutions.  An important program goal is to broaden and deepen climate change teaching and research on UCI’s campus. The program is funded at UCI in 2015/16 through President Napolitano’s Global Climate Leadership Council. This program is intended to incentivize and support faculty leadership in scholarship, teaching, and community engagement about climate-action solutions. 

In 2015, Steven Allison, Associate Professor of Ecology in the departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Earth System Science, received the $25,000 Climate Action Champion Award. Dr. Allison will use this award to develop an integrated training program for graduate students with career interests in climate sustainability. (http://sustainability.uci.edu/2015/09/15/25000-faculty-climate-action-champion-award/)
",--,True,"UC IRVINE STRATEGIC PLAN
The strategic plan for UC Irvine (2005-15) included the following as one of 10 principal objectives for the campus: “Develop innovative programs in emerging disciplines, support interdisciplinary collaboration and establish new research centers by reserving some of the growth resources for these initiatives” (p. 10). Over the past 10 years, UCI reserved a portion of new faculty lines for allocation directly to programs and centers focused on interdisciplinary research. For example, recruitments through the UC Irvine Environment Institute (2008-2013) focused on interdisciplinary sustainability research in key anthropogenic systems and forces driving global change today. 

The opening section in the current UCI Strategic Plan: Working Document for Campus and Community Input, October 2015 states that “From the strengths of our existing schools and departments we will continue to explore those areas on the frontiers of knowledge that cut across traditional structures, where we have unique opportunities to make important contributions focused on global grand challenges, regional imperatives, and the evolving interests and passions of a new generation of students and scholars who seek to explore large ideas.” (p. 1). Support for interdisciplinary research, as indicated by the specific Strategies (and associated Goals) excerpted below, is stated throughout this document.  http://www.provost.uci.edu/img/strategic-plan/151006-StrategicPlan_WorkingDocumentforWebsite.pdf
•	Develop new interdisciplinary faculty hiring programs that make the most of existing strengths in one or more units and have promise for elevating the profile of these areas significantly (Goal 1.1)
•	Incentivize multi-collaborator grant and contract initiatives (Goal 1.2)
•	Invest in academic and administrative structures that promote interdisciplinary practices; new structures should aim to accommodate cross-disciplinary research and education, provide benchmarks for cross-discipline faculty productivity, and implement protocols for allocating resources for research (Goal 1.4)
•	Accelerate faculty hiring in academic areas with the highest potential for establishing UCI’s impact in convergence science (Goal 1.4)
•	Create a campus-wide program for faculty who aspire to offer exploratory or innovative convergence science and other interdisciplinary courses (Goal 1.4)
•	Support faculty across all areas of campus in the exploratory phases of high-risk, transformative, interdisciplinary, and international research on pressing social issues (Goal 1.5)
•	Establish and sustain seed funding programs to promote comprehensive research initiatives that promise to chart new territory in these disciplines (Goal 1.5)
•	Develop specialized programs around existing campus strengths (sustainability, water) and/or interdisciplinary topics (Goal 2.6)
•	Create a strong faculty culture of meaningful community and public engagement by collaborating with the Academic Senate on ways to elevate the impact of interdisciplinary research, service, and teaching as part of the merit and promotion process (Goal 3.1)

UC IRVINE OFFICE OF ACADEMIC INITIATIVES
Established in 2014, the Office of Academic Initiatives promotes greater coordination of promising new multidisciplinary research and educational programs at UC Irvine that more effectively address complex social challenges, make distinctive contributions to important and/or emergent fields of inquiry, and develop innovative academic programs.  The academic initiative program is designed to provide up to three years of support to teams of engaged faculty from across multiple schools who are committed to developing new areas of interschool excellence through research collaborations, academic programs, and outreach and community engagement. UC Irvine has established eight interdisciplinary initiatives (Data Science, Exercise Medicine and Sport Sciences, Medical Humanities, Sustainability Initiative, Water UCI, Salton Sea Initiative, OCEANS UCI, Initiative to End Family Violence). See http://initiatives.provost.uci.edu/

PERSONNEL AND BUDGETARY POLICIES
In addition, UC Irvine has instituted various personnel and budgetary policies to support interdisciplinary research, including (1) formal joint appointments of faculty in two or more disciplinary units with participation of both units in personnel reviews and promotions; (2) enrollment policies that share credit among different departments for students enrolled in courses that cross departmental and school lines; (3) creation of interdisciplinary graduate degree programs that report centrally to Graduate Division rather than to one department or school; (4) accounting changes that allow faculty to credit extramural funding partially or wholly to interdisciplinary research centers rather than to a single home department.

These policy changes have been implemented in conjunction with the more general commitment to innovative interdisciplinary organizations that have characterized UC Irvine since its founding in 1965. For example, Organized Research Units (ORUs) are academic units established by UC Irvine to provide a supportive infrastructure for interdisciplinary research complementary to the academic goals of departments of instruction and research. In accordance with “UC Administrative Policies and Procedures Concerning Organized Research Units,” ORUs are established on single campuses, whereas Multi-campus Research Units (MRUs) exist on two or more campuses. The functions of an ORU are to facilitate research and research collaborations; disseminate research results through research conferences, meetings and other activities; strengthen graduate and undergraduate education by providing students with training opportunities and access to facilities; seek extramural research funds; and carry out university and public service programs related to the ORU's research expertise. An ORU must be complementary to the academic goals of the University, but does not have jurisdiction over courses or curricula and cannot offer formal courses or make faculty appointments. See http://www.research.uci.edu/centers-institutes/oru-guidelines.html.

In 2013, UC San Diego launched an Undergraduate Research Portal. This Portal is intended to be a one-stop-shop for all things related to undergraduate research, and is fully integrated with Port Triton, the UCSD student job board. This Portal permits faculty and external partners to post research opportunities and provides a site where each student can maintain his/her research profile. Additionally, students can link to hands-on research opportunities, scholarship and grant applications, and information about conferences and seminars. They also benefit from faculty mentoring in many areas, including writing and presenting professional papers. The power of the Portal to match students with sustainability and general research opportunities has made this new tool a major success on campus and in the community. 

The Environmental Systems Program and the Urban Studies and Planning program both require all students to complete a senior internship/research project that can be focused on sustainability.

The Chancellor’s Sustainability Undergraduate Research Program  supports undergraduate students from disciplines across campus (including the Fine Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Engineering) to pursue research related to sustainability.  It encourages undergraduate initiatives for campus and community-level sustainability projects and offers students in all academic disciplines an opportunity to actuate and apply their education in sustainability and it facilitates partnerships between faculty, staff, students, and the community.

UC Santa Barbara's Academic Senate Sustainability Work Group offers a Sustainability Champion Program and a Climate Action Champion program which are funded in part from core campus funds and in part from UC Office of the President. The primary goal of the programs is to recognize faculty innovation and encourage ongoing research and teaching in sustainability. Faculty submit competitive proposals that promise to engage undergraduate and graduate students in sustainability issues and provide campus-wide leadership and visibility in sustainability in education and research. Awardees are selected by a committee, based on the merit of their proposals; recipients receive funding to support activities including, but not limited to, graduate and undergraduate research assistants; and all awardees are required to lead an annual Freshman Seminar in Sustainability.
The current Climate Action Champion is Dr. Gretchen Hofmann, a marine biologist whose research focuses on the responses of marine species to future ocean change such as ocean acidification and ocean warming. Dr. Hofmann and her lab group are trying to understand whether and how marine species can adapt to future changes in the ocean. With the help of the award she will engage students in her research and will form student action groups.These groups will be trained to engage audiences in the public and in general outreach settings. The project’s hope is to create a team of outreach specialists on climate change issues that are important to the California coast. In order to reach a more general audience, articles about the research are going to be published on different websites. Her team will include a number of undergraduate outreach specialists on climate change issues that are important to the California coast, which are directly connected to ecological issues and to issues of food security. A joint science and art show with Lily Simonson, depicting Antarctic organism will engage off-campus stakeholders.

Ecological sustainability depends critically on the ability of world food production to manage increasingly limited natural resources. The current Sustainability champion Professor Chandra Krintz strives to address pressing agricultural issues by investigating a unifying cyberinfrastructure and agriculture analytics that enable precision, agronomics-driven farming. Her current project “SmartFarm” focuses on providing growers with a secure and easy to use data analysis and decision support system. Through the sustainability championship program she will give farmers and ranchers the opportunity to learn about and experiment with SmartFarm directly and to engage with UCSB students. The award will be used to support undergraduate and graduate research on SmartFarm. The project implements outreach activities such as workshops and meetings in the Santa Ynez valley in conjunction with local partners such as the Sedgwick Reserve and Industry startups. These events provide a forum in which the community (growers, ranchers, students, researchers, engineers, vendors, state/local officials, etc.) discuss and collaborate on ag-related sustainability issues, policies, and regulations, and to share information that helps and engages the community as a whole.

The University has adopted the concept of research clusters to take advantage of the interrelationship of research areas and capitalize on six areas in which the University and region have strategic advantages.

Clusters are faculty-driven, multi-level frameworks that connect researchers with expertise in various disciplines in a multi-campus system. They provide an inclusive foundation for collective scholarly activity and foster the sharing of ideas.

Each cluster is to develop a strategic plan, which will include cluster hiring and investment in core facilities that will further enliven the research enterprise and ultimately, enrich the student experience. The overarching goal of clusters and the cluster-hiring strategy is to develop a critical mass of skills within the UH System for national leadership in defined areas of strategic growth.",http://www.uh.edu/research/about/clusters,True,"The Energy and Sustainability Research Guide (http://guides.lib.uh.edu/renewable) includes information in alternative & renewable fuels, corporate social responsibility, energy, environmental issues and sustainable development.

Scholarship is a dynamic process, and the University of Maryland recognizes that methodologies, topics of interest, and boundaries within and between disciplines change over time. Faculty are encouraged to engage in innovative discovery and dissemination. Several units are already accustomed to recognizing such different approaches and would not require modifications to existing unit criteria for tenure and/or promotion; however, many fields are challenged with assessment of faculty exploring non-traditional research paths.  Such individuals will often publish in venues unfamiliar to faculty in their tenure homes, and may have different, though similarly important measures of impact, funding sources, and career networks. Examples of faculty practicing non-traditional scholarship include those who:
•	Engage in emerging scholarship that spans more than one discipline, or has a non-traditional approach to an established discipline,
•	Work in multiple traditional disciplines, or
•	Are involved in scholarship outside that of the dominant model of their tenure homes.
Any exceptional arrangement that requires a modification of criteria for tenure and/or promotion shall be specified in a written agreement from the time of appointment up to the third-year review for untenured candidates, or at any time following the award of tenure, and shall be approved by the faculty and administrator of the first-level unit, by the Dean of the school or college, and by the Provost. (APT Policy Section II)

Each candidate should be made aware of the opportunity to request an agreement specifying a modification of criteria for tenure and promotion. This formal written agreement would specify the nature of the candidate’s duties and obligations to the Department. It is recommended that the Department consult with a scholar from the relevant discipline(s), or one who does similar research, if applicable, to develop the agreement. Additionally, Chairs should assign appropriate mentors from a relevant discipline(s).

APT Review of Faculty with Agreements for Modified Unit Criteria
In cases where there is an agreement for modified unit criteria for tenure and/or promotion, Departments should consider identifying alternative venues and forms of dissemination of products of scholarship that would be acceptable alongside more traditional dissemination in their criteria for tenure and promotion. Examples might include:
•	Research or scholarly essays published in refereed journals or books, or accepted for publication in journals or books outside one’s discipline
•	Peer-reviewed handbooks
•	Cross-disciplinary analysis of extant literature
•	Popularizations or applications of scholarly research and theory in journals
•	Computer programs or other media products
In reviewing candidates with agreements for modified criteria, APT review committees should include a professor knowledgeable in other discipline(s), from on or off campus, to serve in an advisory capacity to both the Advisory Subcommittee and the Department APT Review Committee. The Department may wish to have this professor present at the APT Review Committee meeting, in a non-voting capacity, in order to provide context for the candidate’s work. The Chair of the Advisory Subcommittee for the candidate should ensure that some of the reference letters are from scholars who conduct research in the other discipline(s), or of a similar nature to that of the candidate. Faculty involved in the third-year review and the Department APT Review Committee should be provided with the agreement as part of their deliberations. Additionally, the executed agreement must be signed and dated by the candidate and included in materials for external evaluators, as well as in the APT Dossier for review at all levels.

This significantly expands our reach into the marine environment and will broaden the Center’s impact beyond our core work on the Great Lakes.
Another is the Climate Center : The mission of the University of Michigan Climate Center is to contribute to the long-term social, economic, and environment sustainability of the Great Lakes region in the face of climate change and to inform decision makers with useful and useable climate information. Over the last five years, the Climate Center has built a foundation for this work through its urban adaptation pilot program, The Great Lakes Adaptation Assessment for Cities (GLAA-C) and its federally funded climate data development and education program, GLISA. Some of our partners include natural resource managers, watershed councils, municipal governments, state and regional governments, and federal agencies. In all of our programs we aim to serve as a bridge between the research community of the University of Michigan and practitioners in the field. By bringing the research and practitioners together we are able to build programs that provide useful and useable information, informed by leading edge science and research.  Positive Outcomes: Nationally, we played a leading role in the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA), with our researchers co-leading the Midwest Chapter and editing a book on climate impacts that provided critical input to the NCA.

""It's (sustainability) an interdisciplinary field, so of course we support it in so far as we support those departments who engage in teaching and research in those courses identified as supporting sustainability, but normally, units that have a dedicated library fund assigned to them are departments or colleges. In the field of History, for instance, our purchasing includes material on environmental history, but those resources are purchased on our History fund. Our large interdisciplinary databases, like Scopus, Academic Search Complete, JSTOR, etc., index and sometimes provide full text for journals dealing with sustainability topics.

""Cross-disciplinary research is encouraged and is recognized as a valuable complement and enhancement of the candidate's strength and depth in a central area of expertise.""

POLICIES FOR FACULTY MANAGEMENT McIntire School of Commerce:
Collaborative or joint research among the faculty, both within and across disciplines, is encouraged. Collaboration often enhances the quality and relevance of research.

School of Medicine - Criteria for Collaboration:
The NIH roadmap for patient-oriented research endorsed team science and established the expectation of expertise for interdisciplinary investigation and collaboration. The national academies have suggested that the evaluation of outcomes of interdisciplinary research and teaching will focus less on the usual number of publications and more on the impact of these publications.

In Fall 2011, Vanderbilt’s program in American Studies initiated the Sustainability Project (http://www.vanderbilt.edu/americanstudies/sustainability/index.php), which aims to encourage campus-wide dialogue that will promote and further the university’s sustainability efforts.  Due to the success of the program, the Sustainability Project continued into the 2012-13 academic year with a focus on creating a strategic plan for the new minor in Environmental and Sustainability Studies. Vanderbilt’s Center for Teaching sponsored the Cumberland Project (http://cumberland.vanderbilt.edu/) in May 2012, a two-day workshop intended to foster an interdisciplinary teaching and learning community around sustainability themes at Vanderbilt. A follow-up to the American Studies project and also funded by the Gant Foundation, the Eos Project, supports innovative initiatives at Vanderbilt University to promote understanding of urgent environmental issues and social action-pathways to respond to the challenges of climate change. The goal is to energize attention to environment/society concerns in diverse disciplines and campus constituencies. The project organizes programming and offers small grants and fellowships to support faculty and students to develop the vision, knowledge, leadership skills, and networks needed to address pressing problems at the intersections of ecology and social justice, where the well-being of human communities is inseparable from the well-being of more-than-human life-worlds. The Vanderbilt Green Fund expanded in 2016 to include three focuses, allowing for more flexibility to fund projects focused around sustainability research. The Vanderbilt Green Fund (VGF) is intended to systematically reduce Vanderbilt’s greenhouse gas emissions by funding projects with both environmental and economic benefits, and by enabling students, faculty, and administration to engage in the process of transitioning to a clean and sustainable energy future. The fund provides up-front capital to projects of three primary focuses:
•	Classroom Proposals: these focus on sustainability enrichment and experiential education. Examples include student research, guest speakers, field trips, seminar series, conference attendance, student-run mini-conferences, and film screenings.
•	Innovation Proposals: these focus on on-campus projects that increase energy efficiency and promote sustainability efforts in an attempt to reduce energy consumption on campus. Examples include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing energy use, installing clean sources of energy, reducing water use, reducing sewage or pollutants, and spurring behavioral change to reduce energy or material consumption through education.
•	Laboratory Proposals: these focus on improving the sustainability of laboratory operations. Examples include offsetting the increased purchase price of energy/water efficient equipment, e.g. ultra-low freezers, green labware and chemicals, and behavioral change such as the Shut the Sash awareness program or the Green Lab certification and recognition program.

	In addition to these two special programs, environmental engineering, environmental science, and environmental studies majors and minors and environmental policy concentrations are available to Vanderbilt students.

Due to the success of the program in 2011-2012, the Sustainability Project continued into the 2012-13 academic year with a focus on creating a strategic plan for the new minor in Environmental and Sustainability Studies. The Dean of Arts and Sciences awarded discretionary funds of $50,000 for 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 academic years to develop this research and outreach program. 
	The Cumberland Project - One way that individual scholars from across the disciplines are addressing these issues is through their teaching, by focusing on environmental problems as central components of their courses and by embracing interdisciplinary pedagogies that encourage critical thinking, problem solving, and leadership development.  Over the last decade, many universities have sought to encourage these innovations in all disciplines by providing educators intensive workshop opportunities to (re)design courses with significant environmental components. It is toward this goal that Vanderbilt’s Program in American Studies and the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching facilitate the Cumberland Project.  The Cumberland Project includes a two-day workshop in which Vanderbilt faculty engage in discussions and course designing workshops with Vanderbilt leaders in sustainability education.  The workshop joins intellectual stimulation with an opportunity to meet with faculty from around the university and to learn about an array of sustainability resources available on our campus and within our community. The project is intended to build on and strengthen a continuing, vibrant teaching and learning community around sustainability themes. Therefore, particular emphasis is placed on environmental education that is highly interdisciplinary in scope and inclusive of a wide array of environmental studies across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Participants receive $500 in research funds for their participation in the two-day workshop.
	Climate Change Research Network - Participants in the Climate Change Research Network are examining questions such as:
o	What are the aggregate emissions from individuals and households, and how do those emissions compare to the emissions from industry and other source categories? 
o	Which individual behaviors release the greatest amounts of greenhouse gas emissions? 
o	What are the greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicle idling and how can they be reduced? 
o	How do personal carbon calculators vary in their outputs and conversion factors? 
o	Which social psychological theories have the greatest explanatory power for greenhouse gas-emitting behaviors? 
o	How do people perceive and value climate change risks, particularly when they are remote? 
o	How should these climate change risks be valued for policy benefit assessments? 
o	What strategies are chosen by those policy advocates and to what extent are these strategies constrained by the political system in which they evolve? What changes in laws and policies can generate the most cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from individual behavior? 
o	What changes in the administration and staffing of government agencies will be required if climate change laws and policies are adopted?
	The Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and the Environment - The Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and the Environment (VIEE) engages in research and education that directly link the social and behavioral sciences, physical sciences, engineering, law and policy, and that bear on energy and environmental decision making by individuals and by public and private institutions. Specifically, VIEE research elucidates the relationships among individual, institutional, and societal choices for energy production and use, and the impacts and benefits of these choices on the environment and health through links with climate, water quality, economics, social psychology, and natural resources.
	VU/MWS Renewable Energy Showcase - In collaboration with Nashville Metro Water Services (MWS), Vanderbilt University School of Engineering (VUSE) set up a wind-solar renewable energy site at the Love Hill in Nashville. The main purpose of this project is to examine the feasibility of alternative energy production through solar and wind facilities, and the expectation is that about of 30kWh of energy will be generated on a daily basis; 30kWh is the average daily consumption of electrical energy per household across the US, according to the US Energy Information Administration.  
	EOS Project - The Eos Project supports innovative initiatives at Vanderbilt University to promote understanding of urgent environmental issues and social action-pathways to respond to the challenges of climate change. The goal is to energize attention to environment/society concerns in diverse disciplines and campus constituencies. The project organizes programming and offers small grants and fellowships to support faculty and students to develop the vision, knowledge, leadership skills, and networks needed to address pressing problems at the intersections of ecology and social justice, where the well-being of human communities is inseparable from the well-being of more-than-human life-worlds.
	VUCO2– VUCO2 is an interdisciplinary Vanderbilt think tank devoted to Climate Change issues. It organizes reading groups, speakers, workshops, and retreats and spurs development and refinement of various sustainability research ideas. The think tank is housed in the Philosophy department. 
	Sterling Ranch - Sterling Ranch, a 12,000-home planned community south of Denver, will provide a sustainability training site and test bed for Vanderbilt School of Engineering research involving students and professors. The community includes its own commercial space, retail stores and schools. Its design is centered on sustainability and next-generation telecommunications, a focus that’s creating internships and capstone projects for engineering undergraduates plus research opportunities for professors and their teams. The partnership, which includes corporations Mortenson Construction, Siemens and IBM, started with Brock Smethills (BE’13) discussing his idea with David Kosson,  Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Engineering, and Doug Adams, chair of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and holder of the Daniel F. Flowers Chair. They brought in a number of other professors across all departments to advance the concept.

It is not a specific criteria for promotion: that is, someone can be tenured without ever moving outside of his or her home field.  And there is no language in the Handbook that privileges interdisciplinarity. But neither is there any language that disfavors such adventurousness.

In practice, we do look favorably at a candidate's record of participation in the [multidisciplinary] programs (and many candidates solicit partial review letters from programs).  We also look at the evidence of collaborative scholarship either on the C.V. or in the research itself.  We examine the teaching portfolio for new co-taught classes, and for innovative syllabi and assignments, many of which have interdisciplinary components.  

In these ways I'd say that to FASC interdisciplinarity demonstrates creativity, staying fresh and expanding one's horizons, collaborating across departmental lines, and serving the College, all qualities that count in one's favor when tenure and promotion decisions are being made.""
