Ball State University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 08:26:27,rkoester@bsu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Waste minimization is any action that reduces the amount and/or toxicity of chemical wastes that must be shipped off-site for disposal as hazardous waste. The success of any waste minimization program is dependent on the conscientious participation of every individual at Ball State University.

There are three methods of waste minimization followed at Ball State University:

Source Elimination:
Remove the source of the waste by eliminating the process or practice or by substituting another process that does not generate a waste, or generates only a secondary material that can be used as a raw material in another process.  For example, some laboratory demonstrations necessitate the use of chemicals that are toxic or inherently dangerous to handle.  Sometimes these demonstrations can be eliminated, reproduced by other means, or video demonstrations utilized rather than performing laboratory displays that generate hazardous wastes requiring disposal.

Source Reduction:
The second most desirable method of waste minimization is source reduction. This is any activity that reduces the generation of chemical hazardous waste at the source. This can be accomplished by good materials management, substitution of less hazardous materials, and good laboratory procedures. Examples include:

•Implement a waste minimization policy and train all employees and students.
•Re-evaluate procedures to see if a less hazardous or non-hazardous reagent could be used.
•Centralize purchasing of chemicals through one person in the department or laboratory.
•Date chemical containers when received so that older ones will be used first.
•Keep MSDS’s for chemicals on file.
•Inventory chemicals and identify their location at least once a year.
•Perform laboratory experiments or demonstrations on a smaller or micro-scale.
•Update inventory when chemicals are purchased or used up.
•Purchase chemicals in the smallest quantities needed.
•Label all chemical containers to prevent the generation of unknowns.
•When considering a new procedure, obtain the chemicals needed from another lab or purchase small quantities initially.
•Consider the use of pre-weighed or pre-measured reagent packets where waste generation is high.
•Avoid the use of reagents containing arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium and silver.
•Eliminate the use of chromic acid cleaning solutions altogether. Use non-hazardous solutions such as Alconox and Pierce RBS35.
•Substitute red liquid (spirit-filled), digital, or thermocouple thermometers for mercury thermometers when it is feasible.
•Consider using detergent and hot water or  citrus based products for cleaning parts instead of solvents.
•Use latex-based paints which are typically non-hazardous. Excess latex paints should be
recycled. Excess non-latex paints must be handled by EHS as a hazardous waste.
•Utilize vendors that will recycle used antifreeze. Some vendors will recycle the antifreeze on site so the antifreeze never leaves the site.
•The use of coal-fired boilers was discontinued so that no coal ash is being generated which eliminated the need for disposal.
•An evaporator was purchased and installed for disposal of those wastewaters from aquatic research that could not be discharged to the public sewerage system due to chemical contaminants from the studies  This greatly reduces the amount of these wastes being disposed by evaporating the water component.
•Unused latex paints, if not reclaimed and excessed for auction, are treated to allow evaporation of the water component to reduce the quantity of materials disposed.

Recycling:
The third most desirable approach is recycling. When a waste material is used for another purpose, treated and reused in the same process, or reclaimed for another process, it is considered recycling. Examples include:
•When solvent is used for cleaning purposes, use contaminated solvent for initial cleaning and fresh solvent for final cleaning.
•Purchase compressed gas cylinders (including lecture bottles) only from manufacturers who will accept empty cylinders.
•Return excess pesticides to the distributor.
•Have a silver recovery unit installed in photography laboratories. The unit removes the silver from the fixer solution.
•Do not contaminate used oil with solvents because this prevents the oil from being recycled.
•Increase solvent reuse through the use of solvent redistillation.
•Recirculate unused or excess chemicals within the department.
•Collect metallic mercury for reclamation.
•The use of coal-fired boilers was discontinued so that coal ash is no longer being generated which eliminated the need for disposal.
•An evaporator was purchased and installed for disposal of those wastewaters from aquatic research that could not be discharged to the public sewerage system due to chemical contaminants from the studies.  This greatly reduces the amount of these wastes being disposed by evaporating the water component.
•Unused latex paints, if not reclaimed and excessed for auction, are treated to allow evaporation of the water component to reduce the quantity of material to be disposed.


","Chemical wastes are handled and disposed similarly whether or not they are classified as ""Hazardous Wastes"" with proper identification and handling regardless of their status.  BSU has developed written plans and training programs for building maintenance activities, as well as those chemical and biological wastes from laboratories (including art studios).  These programs are available for review on the EHS website at: http://cms.bsu.edu/about/administrativeoffices/riskmanagement/ehs/envhealth
All chemical wastes are accumulated in secure locations for routine pickup and disposal by our chemical waste vendor, Tradebe Environmental Service.

A web-based chemical inventory system, ChemTracker, is available for use by all departments, laboratories, trade shops, and building maintenance supervisors for tracking inventory and locations of chemicals and products.  This system allows identification of surplus or unwanted materials.

Recycling programs have been instituted for RCRA ""Universal Wastes"" such as batteries and lamps.  These are collected throughout campus and the shops, accumulated in our Central Stores Warehouse, and shipped off-site as needed for recycling by Veolia Environmental Services.  A central drum storage area is maintained for accumulation of ""Used Oil"" from campus activities to supplement the used oil accumulation tanks serving the BSU Garage.  These oils are routinely collected for recycling by Heritage Crystal Clean, LLC.

The framework for hazardous waste regulation was established in 1976 by the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA was enacted by Congress to protect human health and the environment from improper management of hazardous waste. RCRA introduced the concept that the generator of a waste is responsible for proper waste management from “cradle-to-grave” (i.e. from the laboratory to the waste’s ultimate destruction). RCRA regulations may be found in 40 CFR Parts 260-279.
At Ball State University, all chemical waste disposal is managed by the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Office of Risk Management, Insurance and Safety. Hazardous chemicals are not allowed to be disposed of in the drains (without EHS and Muncie Sanitary District approval), in the trash, or by evaporation. All chemical wastes are required to be held in the generating location (this location may be either a “Satellite Accumulation Area” or a laboratory) for subsequent pick-up and disposal by EHS and the waste disposal vendor (currently Tradebe Pollution Control Industries, Inc).  

There are specific regulatory requirements for the individuals, laboratories, or shops, that generate and accumulate chemical waste. These individuals must properly identify and label all hazardous wastes in their workplace. They must properly store and submit requests to the EHS for disposal of chemical wastes. 
Laboraties (including art studios and educational technology shops) are to follow the BSU Laboratory Waste Management Plan, while shops and building maintenance personnel are to follow the BSU Waste Management Plan, both of which establish the criteria for identification, characterization, accumulation, labeling, containerizing, and handling chemical wastes.
Finally, they must minimize the amount of waste generated and recycle whenever possible. The purpose of this document is to assist labs, shops, and the various academic Departments with this regulatory compliance. Every lab and shop on campus is subject to unannounced inspections by both the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM). Lack of compliance can result in a Notice of Violation and, potentially, fines or other penalties.

The University maintains centralized hazardous waste accumulation areas or buildings on the north and south campuses for accumulation of wastes removed from shop or building maintenance activities or laboratories.  These waste accumulation areas are maintained and inspected weekly by the EHS Office.  In order to minimize illicit or improper disposal of chemical wastes, wastes are removed from shops or laboratories as requested through the EHS Office, and quarterly chemical waste pickups are scheduled and announced in advance to allow collection, neutralization, or bulking prior to removal by the waste vendor.  This also allows the opportunity to identify ""waste"" or excess materials that are unused products (cleaning and maintenance supplies) to BSU Central Stores for subsequent sale at auction.",NA,See paragraphs above.,True,True,"For the year ending December 31, 2014, Ball State recycled 34,937 lbs. of e-waste.
","Ball State University contracts with Creative Recycling Systems, Inc. (CRS Holding of America - Florida) to recycle, reuse and process the university’s unwanted e-waste (e.g., PCs, laptops, monitors, printers, copiers, fax machines, scanners and networking equipment).  CRS adheres to the industry’s highest environmental, health, and safety standards to eliminate workplace exposure to harmful toxic metal contamination.   CRS uses the latest automated recycling technology, has ISO 14001 Certification for environmental management systems, and conducts audits of its end markets.

Beloit College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 13:47:32,chapmanlr@beloit.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Chemical Reuse:
Unused and unopened chemicals being disposed of as waste due to a change in research or discontinuation of a specific research protocol should be redistributed to other laboratories that can utilize the chemical. Sharing unused chemicals will reduce the amount of chemical waste generated. Specific applicable chemicals (typically stable compounds with a long shelf life) will be picked up by the CHO and segregated in the CAA. These chemicals are inventoried in their new location. 

Inventory Control
Each laboratory/studio/shop is encouraged to maintain an appropriate inventory of chemicals in their laboratory as a method to reduce unnecessary purchase and disposal. The following methods can reduce the amount of chemicals in a laboratory and minimize waste generated from expired or unwanted excess chemicals:
•        Check your inventory and storerooms before ordering.
•        Purchase smaller containers of chemicals or fewer containers of chemicals.
•        Avoid purchasing larger quantities of chemicals to save on raw material costs.
(Chemical disposal costs are often much higher than the initial purchase cost.)
•        Rotate stock of chemicals in use to ensure the older chemicals are used before
the newer chemicals.

Substitution of Less Hazardous Chemicals
In some instances, chemicals that are more environmentally friendly may be substituted for traditionally used chemicals.

Examples:
Propylene glycol instead of Ethylene glycol
Ethyl alcohol instead of Methyl alcohol
Alcohol thermometers instead of Mercury thermometers
Alconox, Pierce RBS35 and Nochromix instead of Chromic acid cleaning solutions
Detergent and hot water instead of Organic solvent cleaning solutions

Microscale (in the laboratory)

Microscale chemistry is a pollution prevention method that decreases the amount of chemical waste generated during laboratory experiments. Standard chemistry procedures are re-written for individual experiments and specialized microscale equipment is utilized to perform the work. In some cases, the amount of a particular chemical needed for an experiment has been decreased by as much as 99 percent. Microscaling has the following benefits:

•        Reduce chemical waste produced at the source.
•        Improve laboratory safety by decreasing potential exposure to chemicals and reducing fire and explosion hazards.
•        Improve air quality due to greatly reduced volumes of solvents and other volatile substances used. 
•        Reduce laboratory costs for chemical purchase and disposal. 
•        Reduce the time required to perform experiments due to shorter chemical reaction times.
•        Decrease the amount of storage space necessary for chemicals. 
•        Encourage students to think about waste minimization. 
•        Decrease disposal costs for the university.
•        Increase environmental awareness for the university.


This Hazardous waste policy is designed to provide guidance for everyone at Beloit College regarding the proper disposal of hazardous waste.  If anyone has additional questions regarding hazardous waste disposal they are encouraged to contact the Chemical Hygiene Officer at 608-363-2388","Hazardous waste collection is performed by CHO on a routine basis and can be requested via phone or email. With either method, the requester must include the following information:
• Requester: The name of the person submitting the request. This person should have knowledge of the waste in the event that the CHO has questions.
• Telephone #: A contact number for the requester or someone else with knowledge of the waste.
•Substance Location: Include the building name and room number. In addition, if the SAA is not readily apparent, the specific location of the waste container should also be noted in the event that CHO performs the waste pick-up when no lab personnel are present.

•  Quantity: Include the number of containers of waste and their volumes.
Example:
Water 50%, Acetonitrile 30%, Methanol 20%                          2 X 5 gallon cans
Water 50%, Acetonitrile 30%, Methanol 20%                          4 X 1 gallon bottles

• If CHO supplies you with 5-gallon waste cans or pails, be sure to note how many replacement containers are needed. Note any additional information about the waste that you feel may be pertinent.
• In the event that waste containers to be collected are intermingled with containers that you want to keep, it is helpful if you mark which containers that are being offered for disposal.
• Remember that CHO will not accept unknown materials. All waste containers must be labeled and their contents identified.
•All waste containers must have a tightly fitting cap that will not leak during transport. Be certain that you have the correct cap for your bottle.

We can also locate chemicals on campus that are not being used very often, so they can be relocated to areas that need the chemicals.  This helps minimize the amount of old chemicals on site that have to be discarded. .  We also have made a significant effort to remove all mercury containing equipment to avoid the potential for spills and the waste generated during spill clean-up.To help reduce cleaning chemical waste, the Facilities Department installed cleaning stations that contain four types of cleaning products in concentrated form. The products are dispensed in appropriate use concentration and very little if any waste is generated.","The responsibility for the proper disposal of hazardous, universal, and non-regulated chemical waste is covered by Berea College’s Department of Environmental Health and Safety.

","The Bowdoin Laboratory Manager conducts a Chemical Reuse Inventory as part of Bowdoin's Waste Minimization Plan.
A 1995 survey of American colleges and universities found that more than ten percent have adopted ""microscale"" laboratory experiments. The microscale concept was first developed and popularized by chemistry professors at Bowdoin College. The principle was to modify standard class-room chemistry procedures in a way that uses a fraction of the typical quantity of chemicals. The goal was to reduce the cost of chemical purchase and disposal and to minimize the risks that accompany the use, storage and disposal of chemicals. After publishing articles on the subject of microscale experiments in the mid-1980's, positive response was so great that Bowdoin faculty decided to develop a textbook and a newsletter on microscale chemistry. Since then, many further texts have appeared and specialized equipment developed. Special microscale glassware is smaller and less breakable. Though an initial investment is required when an institution switches to microscale equipment and textbooks, the cost should be offset by purchase and disposal savings. A crucial benefit of ""going microscale"" is a safer environment for students and instructors, including better air quality(http://www.iisd.org/educate/learn/microscale.htm).",True,True,"The recycling of faculty and staff e-waste (Bowdoin issued computers, phones, PDAs, etc.)  is managed by Bowdoin's Information Technology department and the campus Associate Director of Environmental Health and Safety.

Consolidating compatible hazardous materials has dramatically lowered the over poundage disposed of CSUF over the past 8 years. Other practices implemented include installation of a bulk oil recycling tank and oil filter crusher. Crushed oil filters are sold as scrap metals and the oil is placed into the recycling tank and picked up by a certified oil recycler. Batteries are separated into rechargeable and non-rechargeable varieties. The rechargeable batteries are recycled at no cost to CSUF.

Only items currently in use will be kept in stock, reducing the amount of future waste generated.   ","For hazardous waste, there are designated personnel in each generating department who are responsible for the proper characterization, containerization, labeling and handling of hazardous waste. Their job is to work with faculty/students to ensure the proper protocols are followed, including the proper use of personal protective equipment (ppe).
For universal wastes, student interns have created an information pamphlet that is made available to campus departments and at campus events. These pamphlets emphasize the importance of recycling universal waste and options on/off campus. Campus recycling events provide an opportunity to educate the campus community and give them an opportunity to recycle their waste.",There have been no significant hazardous materials releases in the past three years.,"There is no formalized system for chemical reuse or redistribution, but  unused chemicals that still have potency are kept for less stringent uses (e.g. art, design). Unused boiler treatment chemicals have been transferred to a local community college through a chemical supplier, reducing our hazardous waste generation.",True,True,"The procedures to divert Sacramento State's electronic waste are a joint effort between several campus agencies. Depending on the stream and the condition of the units/materials involved, we employ several possibilities to ensure diversion:
1.University equipment in working order for reuse: This equipment is collected by our IRT department, graded as operational and conditioned to remove all memory from the unit. Our Property department takes posession and, if determined to still be useful for campus agencies, is housed and avaialable for university agencies to reuse.
2.University equipment in working order for public auction: This equipment is collected, graded and conditioned by IRT and then given to Property as before, however, these are materials deemed not to be useful for campus agencies. They are then sold at auction using the following website: publicsurplus.com
3.University equipment salvaged for parts: university equipment collected by IRT and determined to not be reusable maybe salvaged for parts which are then used to repair other equipment. The left-over components are then recycled as decribed in the next step.
4.Univerisity equipment determined by both IRT and Property to not be useful for campus needs and not suitable for public auction are conditioned to have all memory wiped, removed and destroyed, released from campus inventory and taken posssesion of by the Recycling department. All materials collected are then taken to local recycling agency California Electronic Asset Recovery (CEAR) for complete recycling.
5.During portions of the baseline period and during the entire reporting period, Sacramento State opened electronic waste recycling to its entire campus community. Students, faculty, and staff were encoraged to bring personal e-waste to a collection point located within the Facilities Management yard for collection and complete recycle by California Electronic Asset Recovery. Because the university is paid for these materials and after requiring participants to remove, wipe, or destroy all memory, the university encouraged recycling throughout its entire community by accepting e-waste for recycling purposes.
6.The University's Housing and Residential Life department also conducts semester long collections of personal e-waste as well as at special moving-out events. These materials are then turned over to the campus Recycling department for recycling with CEAR.
7.Again, to encourage recycling from the campus community, the Recycling department hosts two campus collection events each year--one in the spring which coincides with the campus Earth Day festivities and one on the Fall to coincide with America Recycles Day. Personal e-waste is collected at these events and recycled via the method mentioned above with the vendor CEAR.
","During both the baseline and reporting periods, Sacramento State has recycled its e-waste with the vendor California Electronic Asset Recovery (CEAR). The University has chosen to work with this vendor for several environmentally related reasons:
1. To discourage long-hauling and reduce carbon emissions, Sacramento State recycles its e-waste with CEAR which is located only 10.2 miles away.
2. CEAR is in complaince with all local and state laws regarding e-waste recycling.
3. CEAR has received numerous sustainable certifications including:
    --The Basil Network E-standard certification
    --QMI-SAI Global ISO 14001 Certified System

Columbia University has a robust solvent recycling program for alcohol, xylene, acetone and ethanol at the Morningside campus.  Electronics, batteries, scrap film are recycled.  Mercury-containing thermometers are exchanged for nonmercury thermometers in laboratories.  Mercury-containing dental amalgam is filtered from the wastewater at Columbia University maintained faculty practices and clinics through the use of dental amalgam separators with a rate of over 99% efficiency.  Silver halide is filtered from wastewater at all Columbia maintained dark rooms through silver recovery traps.   

Re-usable sharps collection containers are employed at most locations generating sharp waste.  The containers are recycled up to 500 times thus reducing plastic in landfills.  Chemically contaminated glassware is crushed prior to disposal as nonhazardous waste thus reducing the total volume.

Additionally, EH&S organizes several working groups to review safety and waste practices including the Chemical Tracking System Committee and the Environmental Management System (EMS) Steering Committee.  

","Columbia University has a strict no drain disposal policy which prohibits the discharge of hazardous, radioactive, mixed and nonhazardous waste down any drain on any campus.  Additionally, the University only utilizes vendors that have gone through a rigorous preferred vendor process.  This process includes a thorough regulatory compliance paperwork review, documentation archiving and in many cases an onsite audit.  The University emphasizes disposal options that reduce our overall impact on the environment such as preferring:  recycling, fuel blending or incineration to landfill disposal methods. Numerous training sessions are preformed throughout the year to advise researchers on how to properly manage their resulting waste streams.  Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S ) also offers monthly safety classroom training sessions as required for laboratory personnel that includes proper disposal procedures.  
",n/a,"Environmental Health & Safety at Columbia University implemented the chemical tracking system (CTS) on the Morningside Campus in 2006.  This system allows Columbia to maintain compliance with federal, state and city environmental regulations and hazardous waste minimization. It has been largely achieved through efficient and appropriate use of the system.
Columbia University has selected the ChemTracker Consortium as the CTS tool.  Chemical tracking is managed at the point of receipt of chemicals to the campus.  Chemical receiving is centralized at two locations.  Chemical shipments from vendors are bar-coded by dedicated personnel in these two locations.  Bar-coded chemicals are delivered to laboratories or the chemicals are picked up by lab staff.  One requirement of the system is that empty chemical bottles are needed to be discarded in designated waste receptacles so that bar code information can be retrieved and inventories adjusted accordingly.  ChemTracker allows researchers to monitor their own chemical inventories on-line and reduce redundant purchases.
Principal Investigators are permitted to view their own departmental inventories trough the CTS. They can check peer’s inventories when they need to transfer chemicals to their lab which minimizes ordering excessive chemicals.
EH&S may receive emails from researchers, search the system, and send information back to researchers to contact and borrow the chemicals.  It has been very successful and researchers use this function to full capacity and are able to reduce excessive chemical inventories.  Further, this allows the reduction of chemical purchases and inventories.
EH&S requests that laboratories send unused chemicals to the EH&S surplus lab. This list is forwarded to researchers, allowing them to pickup surplus chemicals on a first come, first serve basis.  The program is successful enough in that the surplus laboratory is virtually empty at the end of each work day.

In 2001, an on-site recycling program was initiated for spent xylene and ethanol used in  laboratories allowing the chemicals to be returned for use over and over again.  Over the years acetone and methanol have been added to the program for recycling.  After many years and many thousands of gallons, the program is running strong and maintaining green benefits, both environmental and financial.

",True,True,"The University has collection points at each campus for electronic waste generated by the institution.  Materials generated institutionally are brought to the Facilities-maintained storage areas for consolidation and disposal through a vetted recycler on a regular schedule.  This disposal occurs at least monthly at the NYC campuses and as needed at the satellite campuses. Additionally, the University hosts a semi-annual recycling event at multiple campuses where used electronic waste collection centers are set at the campus level, which generates a large amount of e-waste.  

University supplied electronic mobile devices are collected for recycling by CUIT. 

Through Columbia’s Surplus Reuse program, departments can find a matching recipient to receive old working computers to keep them out of the landfill.  Computers are matched to other units within Columbia and to local, community organizations partnered with Columbia Community Service.  Additionally, several departments have donated computers to various non-profit organizations.

Connecticut College,2016-02-28,2016-02-28 16:33:12,jstoffel@conncoll.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Section 3002(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requires generators of hazardous waste to certify that they have a waste minimization program in place, for the purpose of reducing the volume or quantity and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the extent economically practicable.

Beyond simply complying with regulatory mandates, a waste minimization plan can create a positive environmental impact and save the College money. A better-managed inventory and closer lifecycle management of chemicals can reduce the costs associated with purchasing; inventory control; and waste management—including off-site transportation, treatment, and disposal.

Waste minimization is a waste management approach that focuses on reducing the amount and toxicity of hazardous waste that is generated. There are three components to this approach: Source Reduction, Substitution, and Recycling.","At Connecticut College, generator of any hazardous waste is responsible for providing information that will allow the Director of Environmental Health and Safety to properly characterize and manifest the waste for disposal. The Director of Environmental Health and Safety is the only person authorized to schedule shipments of wastes described in this plan, and to sign manifests and/or bills of lading. He may, when necessary, designate this authority for a particular shipment to a trained and qualified alternate. All wastes must be properly characterized prior to disposal. 

Connecticut College is a Small Quantity Generator (SQG). A Small Quantity Generator is one who generates greater than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste in a calendar month, provided that such waste does not include more than:

-a total of one kilogram of acute hazardous wastes, or
-a total of 100 kilograms of any residue or contaminated soil, waste, or other debris resulting from the clean-up of a spill, into or on any land or water, of any acute hazardous waste, provided that there is no more than a total of one kilogram of acute hazardous waste contained in that residue, soil, waste or debris.

Satellite Accumulation Storage Rules:

-Waste must be stored in containers, which are compatible with the waste and have a tight fitting cap or cover.
-Waste containers MUST be kept tightly closed at all times, except when adding waste.
-Waste containers, which are going to be used as the shipping container must be DOT approved.
-Waste containers must be in a secure location and under the control of the person generating the waste.
-Waste containers must be in good condition, and not leaking, or damaged.
-No more than one container of a particular waste can be kept at one time.
-When a container of waste is full or when that type of waste will no longer be generated, it must be taken to the waste storage area within 72 hours.
-To minimize the hazard of incompatible chemical reactions, wastes should not be mixed without prior approval from the Environmental Health and Safety Office.

Waste containers must be labeled with an orange ""HAZARDOUS WASTE"" label.",The College responds to any hazardous material release incidents in accordance with all applicable laws.,"Connecticut College has an online chemical inventory system that allows all users to see what chemicals are currently on campus. 

Faculty are encouraged to check the inventory before ordering new chemicals. If the material is available elsewhere, either in their department or not, they are asked to contact the owner to see if an informal arrangement can be made in regards to sharing.",True,True,"The College's Director of Environmental Health and Safety oversees the program that ensures that all ""College owned"" electronic waste is recycled/disposed on in the most environmentally and social responsible way possible. This same program is open for students' electronic waste that is ""developed"" on campus (i.e. a students computer dies, etc).

Additionally, the College has a robust ink and toner cartridge recycling program that all College community members are encouraged to participate in. ","On a regular basis, the College's contract for recycling and disposing of electronic waste is reviewed to ensure that the organization that the is College working with is holding itself to the highest environmental and social responsibility standards.",http://www.conncoll.edu/offices/environmental-health-and-safety/environmental-compliance/hazardous-waste-management-plan/,--
Cornell University,2016-03-18,2016-03-18 08:39:46,cma18@cornell.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Cornell University's Environmental Health and Safety department operates chemical waste management program that collects these wastes from campus generators. This program includes generator training, pollution prevention efforts, and careful consideration of disposal options to minimize environmental impacts associated with these wastes.

Each type of hazardous waste is handled and processed differently, but in a safe and compliant manner. There are also activities tied to these waste streams to reduce the volume generated as well as the volume disposed.
 
For calendar year 2014:
Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) totaling 119.46 tons for calendar year 2014 and carcass waste totaling 237.62 tons for the same period are treated and disposed of at the College of Veterinary Medicine’s Waste Management Facility. The final product of the treatment processes there is a non-hazardous solid waste that is landfilled.  Relatively small quantities of each waste stream (i.e., 1.75 tons of RMW contaminated with chemotherapeutic agents and 2.32 tons of carcass waste contaminated with plastic items in 2014) are shipped offsite for incineration via commercial disposal contractor. Cornell Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) provides oversight of campus management of RMW. 

Hazardous Chemical Waste, at the total of 55.8 tons, was generated in 2014. The chemical waste is collected by EH&S and processed at our 90-day facility. Increase of Hazardous Chemical Waste over last year is due to several projects which generated large volumes of wastewater and some pcb’s; of the 55.8 tons, 10.2 tons were corrosive waste neutralized onsite through the Duffield Elementary Neutralization system and was not shipped offsite. There is also waste that does not meet the definition of hazardous waste, but for the safety of the environment is not suitable for drain or trash disposal. These types of waste are handled by the contractor and processed to reduce the environmental impacts prior to disposal. 

The campus has a variety of programs and processes to track and reduce the chemicals used in the lab. The chemical inventory system varies on campus by location, the most complete being the chemistry department. They have a central procurement system and location, then distribute chemicals to the labs and track their disposal via bar code.

The third waste stream generated on campus is radioactive waste, which totals 5753 lbs.  of waste for calendar year 2014. All radioactive material is controlled by EH&S using a single point entry and exit. EH&S recommends the procedures outlined in the Radiation Safety Manual methods for surveying radioactive waste, this process reduces the waste to only material with detectable radioactivity. Any material that does not meet the definition of radioactive is disposed of only by EH&S as solid waste. Any waste that has a half-life of 90 days or less is held on-site for decay. Once the material has decayed a minimum of 10 half-lives and meets the disposal criteria is disposed of as solid waste minimizing the amount of radioactive waste generated. The waste that is shipped off has two processes to reduce volume. One waste stream is incinerated for volume reduction and burial and the other is used for energy recovery. The volume of radioactive waste is small compared to others, but is highly regulated and weighs heavy on public perception.

Minimizing the amount hazardous waste generated is the primary goal of OESO, Environmental Programs, and this is a shared responsibility between the individual generators and OESO, Environmental Programs. Current opportunities to minimize hazardous, universal, and non-regulated chemical waste generated at Duke University include: 

PRE-PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS
Persons ordering chemicals should purchase only the amount of chemicals which are needed in order to avoid the disposal costs of excess chemicals, which often outweigh the savings of ordering larger quantities.

INVENTORY CONTROL
The chemical inventory control system prevents additional purchases of chemicals that already exist onsite, reducing costs and saving time. OESO, Environmental Programs collects unused or expired chemicals across the institution for disposal or reuse.

VOLUME REDUCTION
Chemical users utilize ""micro"" volume methods whenever possible, reducing the aqueous components in samples and reducing the total amount of waste generated for disposal. Another practice which reduces the total volume of hazardous waste is to carefully segregate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.

PROCESS CHANGE
OESO, Environmental Programs encourages the institution to switch from hazardous to non-hazardous chemicals and change concentrations of highly hazardous chemicals. One example of this is the replacement of mercury-containing equipment such as thermometers with electronic equipment.

SURPLUS EXCHANGE
OESO Environmental Programs manages a surplus chemicals exchange program. Unopened chemicals are collected, stored, and made available for redistribution elsewhere free of charge. The surplus chemical exchange is located at 017 Medical Sciences Research Building (basement level near the loading dock). A current inventory of chemicals is posted on the door of Room 017, or inquiries can be made by telephone to OESO EP or by searching the Internet at: http://www.safety.duke.edu/ChemEx/chemex.asp","OESO, Environmental Program Division makes hazardous waste decisions in accordance with RCRA guidelines, prepares wastes for shipment and disposal, and provides assistance to generators as necessary.

OESO, Environmental Programs also provides support to the Health System to manage the generation and handling of hazardous drug waste, evaluate environmental risks, and ensure compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Radioactive waste is accumulated in laboratories in waste containers and picked up by OESO, Environmental Programs.

Requests for a waste pick up are submitted by registered users through the OESO LSM system. OESO Environmental Programs then reviews the request, approves the waste determination, and picks up the waste from the requestor.

Indiana University Bloomington,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 09:44:04,brownwm@indiana.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The following guidelines are provided to employees for hazardous waste minimization. This requires active thought and preparation as chemicals are purchased and used:

    Inventory your chemicals: The most important step you can take toward waste minimization is to know what you currently have and use by maintaining a running inventory of chemicals in your work place. An inventory is also an invaluable tool in emergency situations. Not only is this a good idea, but a chemical inventory is required under the hazard communication standard.
        Check your current inventory before ordering to avoid unnecessary purchases!
        Note the date a container is acquired or opened on the container.
        Use older chemicals before purchasing or opening new bottles to reduce the amount of product wasted because a chemical has passed its expiration date.
    Order only what you need: Buy what you will use in a reasonable time period. Buying in bulk rarely saves money when you consider disposal costs of unused material.
        Testing a new experiment and not sure what you need? Start small. Purchase small amounts to perform trials of a new procedure.
        It may also be possible to borrow small amounts of chemicals from other labs. Please take the time to check.
        Centralize purchasing. Stop duplicate ordering by designating one person in your lab or work group to be responsible for chemical purchases.
        Purchase compressed gas cylinders or lecture bottles only from manufacturers who will accept returns of empty cylinders.
    Use recycled or second hand chemicals whenever possible: Be on the lookout for unwanted chemicals in other labs or work areas. Before you call EHS to dispose of an unwanted but usable chemical, please check to see whether other labs in your building can use the material. Pay special attention when you hear of a lab group that is moving or a work group that is changing a process!
        Evaluate the possibility of redistillation of waste solvents in your lab.
    Reduce the amount of product used. This can be achieved by reducing the scale of experiments. Periodically review your procedures to see if this is possible. Also, make sure you read and follow instructions so that you only use what is needed. Get away from the false belief that “if one cup works, then 2 cups will really be great? This is especially true for application of pest control and fertilizers. What is not used will only run off to water resources or contaminate soil.
        Prevent students in teaching labs from over-dispensing chemicals by pre-weighing chemicals needed for experimentation, storing stock chemicals in small nozzle bottles, and preparing stock solutions prior to each experiment.
        Substitute instrumental methods for wet chemistry whenever possible.
    Substitute non-toxic or less toxic materials: Consider less toxic substitutes for commonly used chemicals. These substitutions can be done in most situations with satisfactory results. EHS is happy to provide waste minimization consultation and green product evaluation.
        Detoxify or neutralize waste products within experimentation procedures whenever possible.
    Maintain accurate labels on all product and waste bottles to ensure that unknown chemicals are not generated.
    Do not mix hazardous and non-hazardous waste: Non-hazardous waste, when mixed with hazardous waste, will become hazardous itself. This only results in increased volumes of hazardous waste produced. For example, a solvent is used to clean residues of an oil spill, and the rag is then placed in a drum of oil and absorbent material. This drum, formerly non-regulated with a disposal cost of $45, is now hazardous waste and disposal will cost the university $211.56. 
        High concentration waste should not be mixed with low concentration waste.
        Avoid experiments that produce waste that is both radioactive and chemically hazardous or biologically and chemically hazardous.


The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) maintains a webpage aimed to provide information to identify the specific hazards of the products used and to reduce or eliminate exposure risks. When surplus chemicals are given to EHS, it is first determined whether the chemical is indeed a waste, or whether it can be reused or recycled. If it is a waste, the degree of hazard and the appropriate disposal route are determined. Throughout this process, the university is required to keep records that account for hazardous wastes throughout the lifecycle of the product.

http://ehs.iu.edu/topics/waste-management/hazardous-waste-minimization.shtml","Proper handling and disposal of hazardous waste is critical to worker safety, the health of the community and the protection of our environment. Collection and processing of these wastes is managed by EHS, Radiation Safety, and, in some cases, Laboratory Animal Resources personnel. 

IU has developed a consolidated online request form that allows users to request hazardous materials management or waste minimization assistance, and/or disposal of hazardous wastes in one step. This request form can also be used to request additional replacement supplies such as containers or tags.
http://ehs.iu.edu/help/request-hazmat-assistance.shtml

All hazardous waste must ultimately be managed by a permitted Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF). The waste codes assigned to a waste and its physical properties determine which treatment/disposal techniques are available.

Fuel substitution at a cement kiln, wastewater treatment (neutralization, precipitation of metals, reduction, etc.), stabilization of metal-bearing solids, and rotary kiln incineration are the methods most frequently employed for final disposal of wastes generated by Indiana University.",Our spill report records indicate that no such incidents occurred within the last three years. ,"Indiana University has a chemical inventory database which allows researchers to make exchanges with new/used chemicals. Although there is no formal policy requiring labs to reuse older chemicals before new ones, as space and need for the older/used chemicals runs out they are sent back to the vendors to be burned in a cement kiln for energy.  There are guidelines in place to encourage employees to try to use unwanted chemicals from other labs and to see whether others can use the chemicals they no longer need before disposing of them.  ",True,True,"Surplus electronics are delivered to Surplus Stores and either resold or recycled off site by Unicor. Broken electronics are categorized as electronic waste and are picked up by EHS and recycled by Unicor.

Previously, IUB held a number of E-Waste Collection Days, which collected 141,070 pounds of electronic waste in June of 2013. Now, the Monroe County Solid Waste Management District offers free recycling of electronic waste year-round to the community, and IU's E-Waste Days are no longer required.","To obtain consistency in electronic waste collection Midwestern states have designed 14 guiding principles to guide e-waste programs.

The 14 guiding principles include:
* Manufacturers are responsible for ensuring the collection, transportation, and recycling of waste electronics.
* Manufacturers register with the state.
* Retailers are required to only sell products from registered manufacturers.
* The obligation of manufacturers is determined by the weight of covered equipment sold in a particular state the previous year, although a broader array of electronic devices apply towards meeting the obligation. The Initiative’s list of covered equipment: televisions, monitors, laptops and desktop computers.
* Manufacturers may choose to operate their own program or pay a per pound fee to the state.
* At the end of each year, the manufacturers submit a report on the amount of material collected for recycling and, if short of their obligation, remit a per-pound fee for the remaining amount.
* Retailers report to manufacturers on their sales in a particular state.
* Manufacturers collecting more than their annual obligation may bank the credit towards the following year’s obligation or sell it to another manufacturer.
* Manufacturers will have an incentive to provide collection and recycling opportunities in both urban and rural areas.
* Collection agents and recyclers must register with the state to participate in the system.
* All e-waste collected must be handled according to environmentally sound management standards.
* A disposal ban is to be implemented within two years of enactment
* The state is authorized to participate in a multi-state entity to facilitate multi-state implementation.
* States may choose to establish a third-party organization to implement provisions of the statute.

To reduce these kinds of wastes in the science departments, faculty who run labs that use materials that could become hazardous waste are encouraged to only use what they need. Chemicals are also shared within departments so the college does not have to buy in unnecessary bulk, which would create excess. There is also an inventory system that combines the chemistry and biology departments (since they are the only science departments that would use hazardous materials), so the college does not buy chemicals that are already in stock, and so the chemicals can be shared.

To dispose of hazardous and other potentially dangerous wastes, two parties coordinate with campus safety. These parties are the two lab safety officers who manage waste from labs, and the head of the Center for the Arts Building, where art classes that use paints and other materials that need proper disposal are held. Then, campus safety coordinates with a company called Clean Harbors to safely come and pick up the waste to be disposed of properly.

Fortunately, there have been no significant hazardous material release incidents during the previous three years. 



","All batteries, lamps, and ballasts through a local reputable company AERC. 

Clean Harbors picks up the hazardous waste (i.e. chemical waste from Biology and Chem Department, fixer waste from Art department, latex paint from Theater, and occassionally there is additional waste from another department). ",None,"Muhlenberg College has implemented a campus-wide inventory system to facilitate the reuse of laboratory chemicals
All products used or created in any lab are stored for utilization in future labs.
",True,--,"Electronic Waste
We restore 95% of our computers to their original operating system and wipe them clean as well. The operating system we have on them at the time of purchase is licensed by Muhlenberg, so we can’t let that get out to other parties. Then we partner with the public relations department to donate them to schools, boy scouts, needy families, staff members, and other organizations. The donatees have to sign an agreement saying that they will dispose of it in an environmentally friendly manner. It’s mainly protection for the college in case someone chucks it out and it gets back to Muhlenberg. 

The other 5% is just not in working order so it gets sent off to AERC Inc., which is part of a contract within the LVAIC college community. They also take ballasts and florescent lighting and all other of the institution’s electronics. They come twice a year, and we need to provide them an entire list of everything we’re giving them, with models and serials numbers of the equipment. That list then gets attached to a purchase order. Once they AERC processes the hardware, the college gets issued a certificate of destruction. 
Electronic waste is recycled responsibly, workers’ basic safety is protected, and environmental standards are met because “each AERC facility is fully EPA permitted and complies with all state & federal EPA, OSHA, and DOT Regulations”.  

Students can recycle batteries, printer cartridges, and plastic bags in the Seegers Union building. 

","Muhlenberg does have a program in place to recycle or reuse equipment for institutional equipment. Currently 85%/90% of our discarded computer equipment gets handed out to community groups or organizations.
No program in place for student electronic waste

The EH&S department provides leadership in working with the campus community to ensure a safe and healthful working and learning environment. EH&S endeavors to reduce hazardous waste through training, education, and chemical inventory practices. The practices of waste minimization are encouraged from the very basic training that students, staff, and faculty receive at the beginning of their time with NAU. The sharing of chemicals between laboratories and departments is encouraged to avoid the purchase of excessive amounts of chemicals resulting in an increase in waste. Unused chemicals offered for disposal are shared with other laboratories or facilities on campus in order to minimize waste.","Hazardous and non-regulated chemical waste that has been generated on campus is managed by EH&S in a manner compliant with EPA and other federal regulations prior to being shipped off-campus for recycling or treatment prior to disposal. Whenever possible materials are recycled or recovered, when this is not possible these materials are then treated and disposed of in a responsible and compliant manner. Universal waste is managed by the facilities department at NAU with oversight from EH&S. Following similar practices, all materials are recycled or reclaimed when possible or treated and disposed of properly if neither of the former options exists.",NAU has not had any significant hazardous materials releases in the three years prior to this report.,"EH&S has recently developed a new chemical inventory system for the purpose of tracking hazardous chemicals on campus. This system provides reliable accountability of chemical storage and usage for regulatory purposes.

This encourages the reuse or redistribution of chemicals that would otherwise be destined for hazardous waste disposal.",True,True,"The electronic waste program at NAU comprises a couple of steps. Unwanted electronics are first sent to NAU Property Surplus. There are collection points for electronic waste materials located in the dormitories on campus. At the end of each year when the dormitories are vacated, any unwanted and unclaimed materials are turned over to NAU  Property Surplus. Surplus then determines if items are sellable to the public as surplus property or not. If it is determined that the equipment cannot be sold through surplus it is sent to an E-scrap pile housed in the NAU surplus facility (all computers must be wiped before selling or scrapping). The e-scrap is then placed on a pallet, once enough pallets have been collected, an E-Scrap auction is held for individuals that are interested in buying pallets of electronic components; scrap computers, etc. by the lot. If there are no buyers for the scrap pallets, they are then sent to a recycling company.",The recycling company that is utilized is certified by R2:2008; ISO 14001:2004 and RIOS.

Princeton University,2016-01-20,2016-01-20 17:01:07,kristiw@princeton.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) manages hazardous and non-regulated chemical waste disposal, and University Building Services manages the disposal of universal waste including fluorescent lamps, electronics and rechargeable batteries. The University’s Purchasing Department manages a surplus equipment program that includes various types of electronics, including computers, monitors, etc. The surplus equipment program finds reuse opportunities for such items. Those items not fit for reuse are managed as universal waste.
 
EHS continuously pursues waste reduction techniques by working directly with lab research staff and through collaboration and benchmarking with environmental compliance staff at sister institutions. All laboratory workers are asked to consider pollution prevention opportunities for all of their operations. This includes reducing or eliminating chemical use and chemical waste production. For example, EHS has a long standing mercury thermometer exchange program by which laboratories are encouraged to exchange mercury thermometers for non-mercury varieties (e.g., digital, alcohol/spirit filled) at no cost.
 
Additionally, EHS considers the most environmentally beneficial treatment method for the hazardous and non-hazardous chemical waste that is generated. Spent flammable solvents, for example, are shipped for ‘fuel blending’ whenever possible. This program ensures that flammable liquid with high BTU value is burnt as industrial fuel rather than simply incinerated for waste destruction. Further, unused surplus chemical reagents are offered for reuse whenever possible to minimize chemical waste disposal. EHS encourages laboratories to install under-the-counter lab glass washers. This significantly reduces the use of solvents for cleaning, rinsing and drying of glassware.
 
EHS now prohibits the use of thermal stills in laboratories. The “push columns” that replace these stills drastically reduce the amount of unusable solvent, saving us from several drums of solvent waste each year.
 
EHS encourages just-in-time delivery of chemicals in research laboratories to avoid stockpiling chemicals. In the arts, our Visual Arts department has eliminated the use of solvent-based thinners and metal-based paints.
 
For art studios within our residential colleges, EHS prohibits solvent-based thinners, metal-based paints, metal-based glazes for ceramics, and any other material that would result in hazardous waste generation.
 
Over the past several years nearly all of the photo developing labs have been eliminated and replaced by digital studios.
 
Universal wastes are minimized through purchasing standards that preclude the purchase of mercury containing fluorescent lamps. The so-called ‘green tip’ or ‘green lamp’ purchasing program is campus wide and ensures only low-mercury lighting is purchased for use in University buildings.","Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) manages hazardous and non-regulated chemical waste disposal and has done so since the creation of the US EPA and the onset of disposal regulations. EHS maintains the chemical waste program and takes great care to ensure both hazardous and non-regulated chemicals are disposed of properly and in full compliance with Federal and State of New Jersey regulation. University Building Services manages the disposal of universal waste including fluorescent lamps, electronics and rechargeable batteries. The waste management programs are routinely inspected by NJ Department of Environmental Protection and by private environmental compliance consultants hired by the University.
 
EHS holds contracts with two environmental firms to safely and conscientiously dispose of our chemical wastes. EHS reviews the disposal methods and chooses the most environmentally sustainable method at treatment/disposal companies that have maintained a high level of compliance. Periodically, EHS audits these firms to ensure that they are meeting our criteria.

The spill would have been contained to an interior overflow tank; however, protective plugs installed to prevent water intrusion during installation of the underground tank were never removed upon commissioning of the system.  As a result, the gasoline flowed out of the pump unit onto the paved surfaces adjacent to the station.  The leak wasn’t initially detected because of heavy rains.  The overall quantity spilled was estimated to be 1-5 gallons.  The impact to the surrounding environment was limited due to the quick action of the employees in and around the station.  That said, some of the fuel was carried into adjacent storm water management areas with the rain runoff.  Contracted emergency response personnel arrived to remove the contaminated standing rainwater and also performed decontamination of the storm water management drains, piping and outfall.

These wastes are related to utilities and maintenence operations, and source reduction is the preferred method. One source reduction method is to minimize the amount of water used when cleaning cooling towers to concentrate the sludge generated. Research hazardous wastes vary widely and do not generally lend themselves to source reduction. One successful waste minimization activity undertaken for research wastes has been to replace thimerosol (contains mercury) with other preservatives in biological research. Stanford also operates a program to replace mercury thermometers with non-mercury thermometers at no cost to the labs. Finally, the Green Labs program at Stanford encourages the replacement of toxic chemicals with less hazardous alternatives through MIT's Green Chemistry wizard.  ","All regulated wastes are disposed either through off-site high temperature incineration, fuels blending, treatment such as metals removal for aqueous wastes, or landfill at RCRA approved facilities. Only wastes that do not lend themselves to other technologies are landfilled.",No significant releases.,"In Spring 2016, Stanford hosted its first annual laboratory sharing event, in which labs donated  good-quality, usable items which other labs could then take as needed. The event was a big success with over 100 labs participating, an estimated $50,000 in research funding saved, and tons of “waste” diverted out of the landfill. Due to its success, Stanford is planning on repeating the event annually.   

Stanford also makes use of the Chemtracker online chemical inventory system for all campus labs.  As an additional waste reduction measure, Stanford administers a surplus chemical program through which surplus chemicals from campus labs are made available free of charge to all members of the Stanford Research Community, rather than being disposed of as hazardous waste. 

",True,True,"The University provides a number of options for insuring that all e-waste generated via business operations is recycled. The Property Management Office (PMO) instructs individuals responsible for each department's assets in how to properly request disposal of all electronic items.

PMO schedules and coordinates the pickup via the Surplus Property Store (SPS). SPS is a group within the PMO. SPS personnel pick up a given electronic item and assess its quality and condition for resale. If deemed ""reusable"" it is sold intact to university personnel and/or the public. If it is not deemed reusable, it is containerized for shipment to the designated recycling facility. These shipments occur weekly. PMO also coordinates e-waste drop-off stations at campus cleanup events.

If it is found that a waste material is hazardous waste, then these wastes are collected and stored in temporary locations known as satellite accumulation areas. The wastes are labeled to identify the contents and the containers are kept closed at all times. In addition, hazardous wastes are segregated to ensure chemical compatibility.  Once a satellite accumulation area becomes full, the College's Environmental Health and Safety Office is contacted to complete a waste pickup for the space. All wastes are collected and transported to a ""90-day storage"" area on campus. Periodically, the College contacts an outside vendor to pickup all of the waste that has accumulated in the 90-day area. The vendor segregates all of the chemical waste, packs the waste material into drums, labels the drums for transportation, completes shipping paperwork (hazardous waste manifest), and finally, loads all of the drums onto a truck for transport.  The waste material is then brought to a 10-day storage facility where it is placed on another truck which will take it to the final disposal facility. These disposal facilities are located all over the country and different facilities can accept and process different types of waste. Different treatment options are utilized for different waste streams. Whenever feasible, ESF prefers to recycle or reclaim waste materials. Examples of this are mercury bearing items such as thermometers and manometers.

It is part of higher education to assist students in learning to identify, handle, and dispose of hazardous chemicals in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Tufts is committed to the recommendation of the American Chemical Society ""to buy less, use less"" in the design of experiments involving hazardous chemicals. 

Tufts University recycles all batteries as part of its universal waste program.

In support activities, water-based coatings, sealants, and cleaning products are selected preferentially over such products that contain organic solvents.

There are strict limits on the disposal of chemicals into the sewer and into solid waste containers; hence all chemical waste is analyzed and disposed of as either hazardous or non-hazardous, non-regulated waste.

The Office of Environmental Health & Safety (OEHS) reviews all chemical purchase requests in order to track chemical inventories and assess chemical safety issues.  Bulk purchases of chemicals are discouraged since costs associated with disposal of unwanted chemicals may ultimately exceed any savings.  Other waste minimization methods include:
•	Evaluating procedures to determine if hazardous materials can be eliminated or substituted with less toxic materials;
•	Using inventory control to avoid accumulation of unwanted chemicals;  
•	Reducing the scale of lab experiments to the minimum size necessary to achieve research/experimental objectives;
•	Avoiding the use of reagents containing heavy metals;
•	Replacing mercury-containing equipment (thermometers) with alcohol thermometers at no cost to the department;
•	Not mixing hazardous waste with non-hazardous waste;
•	Recycling of unused/unwanted chemicals within a department; 
•	Re-distillation of used solvents; 
•	Developing policies and procedures regarding waste management; and
•	Providing training and guidance related to hazardous waste, universal waste, and chemical safety.

In addition, the OEHS provides and distributes ECO-Funnels (chemical waste containers with funnels and hinged lids) to help facilitate proper collection and disposal of chemical waste and prevent drain disposal.     

","The OEHS is directly responsible for managing all hazardous chemical waste that is routinely generated as a result of clinical, research, teaching and maintenance operations.

Some of the methods we teach in the class are listed below: ordering only exact volumes to be used; being aware of any properties that may preclude long term storage (peroxide formers, degradation, etc.); using suppliers who can provide quick delivery of small quantities; checking your existing chemical inventory before ordering new chemicals; disposing of unneeded chemicals; promoting sharing among common users or returning excess chemicals to storage for use by others; and rotating chemical stock to keep chemicals from becoming outdated. In addition, researchers are instructed to employ small scale protocols whenever possible, use non-hazardous substitutes, return unused chemicals to vendor when possible, and avoid mixing hazardous and non-hazardous waste. 

UCLA has offered a Surplus Chemical Exchange Program for several years. EH&S collects unused chemicals and publishes an inventory of what is available on our website. Researchers can view the inventory and request chemical products, which are delivered to them free of charge.

Some basic waste streams can be neutralized for drain disposal in consultation with EH&S. We review all drain disposal considerations so that they meet the requirements of DTSC Hazardous Waste regulations and our Industrial Wastewater permit with the City of LA.

EH&S publishes information to the campus community through email alerts and our website on non-hazardous substitutes for research reagents. 

In addition, EH&S offers a free mercury thermometer exchange program. Any researcher who brings in a mercury filled thermometer will receive a free alcohol filled thermometer in return. We have removed approximately 40 pounds of mercury from campus as a result of this program.","UCLA disposes of all chemicals and other materials that meet the DTSC definition of hazardous waste in approved and permitted TSD Facilites. EH&S provides a weekly pick-up at each lab building, allowing researchers to bring their hazardous waste to our technicians at the appropriate loading dock of their building. The researchers print their own hazardous waste tags using a UC-system online tag program. The technicians scan the waste tags (using a barcode scanner), check the labels for accuracy, and then segregate the waste by hazard class, and transport it to our campus 90 day facility. Once a month our hazardous waste vendor packs and ships out our waste. All hazardous waste is shipped to facilities that are EPA approved and participate in a UC-wide audit program. 

Universal waste is handled primarily by the campus Recycling program in Facilities Management. They provide pick-ups upon request, label it appropriately, and bring it to their storage yard where it is picked up by their universal waste vendor, a DTSC licensed recycler. EH&S also collects small handheld electronics, batteries and fluorescent bulbs during the hazardous waste pick-up and arranges to drop them off at the campus Recycling program.

UCLA also hosts the LA City Household Hazardous Waste Program. This program is open to the public and is available to campus staff and visitors to dispose of their household chemicals, electronic waste, batteries, pharmaceuticals and medical sharps. We collect hazardous waste from the public three days a week 50 weeks a year.

In order to minimize waste disposal while making use of valuable chemicals, EH&S has implemented a surplus chemical redistribution program. On the EH&S website there is a list of chemicals in the Surplus inventory, which are available at no cost to the campus researchers. The inventory is updated monthly, and researchers review the inventory and request materials via email. EH&S delivers the chemicals to their laboratory free of charge. 

A smaller chemical surplus inventory is also located in the Chemistry department. This program is managed by the Chemical Safety Officer and is inventoried and inspected regularly to ensure safe chemical storage. Researchers drop off and pick up partially used containers of inorganic salts and other non-reactive, non-flammable materials, for use in the organic chemistry department. This allows researchers access to many compounds that they may only use in very small quantities.

Waste Minimization is reduction in the quantity of hazardous wastes achieved through a conscientious application of innovative or alternative procedures. Simple adjustments to a process producing wastes (e.g. a teaching lab experiment, a vehicle cleaning operation, etc.) may be the only requirement to achieve some results. However, looking at the broader picture in the University environment, it is often difficult to recognize waste reductions due to the complex and changing growth patterns within the campus community. Reductions are often offset by increased staff and student growth and/or building construction.

All wastes generated on campus are evaluated to determine if they are classified as hazardous waste.  Those materials which are hazardous waste are managed in accordance with CDPHE requirements including:

•	Minimizing releases to the environment by proper storage and handling procedures
•	Off-site disposal at EPA approved treatment, storage and disposal facilities 

UCCS segregates waste streams in an attempt to broaden our disposal options such as participating in fuel blending programs for non-halogenated solvents and incineration programs.  

In addition, UCCS encourages labs to minimize the amount of hazardous waste being generated by reducing both the volume and toxicity of materials utilized on campus.  We have some labs engaged in green chemistry.  Likewise, our custodial staffs have predominantly converted to green cleaning products.

We encourage labs to reutilize, to the extent it is safe, empty reagent containers for their waste collection.  Excess empty containers are placed in our single stream recycling program.

The campus does maintain an inventory of hazardous materials present on campus.  If excess hazardous materials are submitted during the hazardous waste collection process, attempts are made to find alternative users for that material before it is disposed of as hazardous waste.

Non-regulated Hazardous Materials

UCCS treats non-regulated hazardous materials in a manner similar to hazardous waste.  Disposal of any hazardous material into the trash is strictly forbidden.  UCCS works with our hazardous waste disposal contractor to manage and properly dispose of non-regulated hazardous materials.

UCCS has a robust copy and printer toner/ink recycling program.  This program includes selling some used toner/inks, returning some to the manufacturer for recycling and/or sending to an offsite recycler for material recovery.

Biological Wastes

UCCS segregates its biological waste streams into those that can be treated on-site and those which require off-site treatment and disposal.  Those waste streams which can be treated via autoclave are treated on-site and then managed as solid waste.  Sharps and other biological waste streams which cannot be treated via autoclave are collected and disposed of off-site via a Colorado registered Biohazardous Disposal Company.  Generally these go for incineration.

Universal Wastes

Some other hazardous chemicals like solvents are reclaimed through fractional distillation columns, housed in EHSO as well as the Department of Chemistry. UIC also recycles alkaline batteries (universal waste). Unwanted chemicals are given to other researchers  via the Chemical Redistribution Program as opposed to disposing of the chemicals as waste.
","Chemical waste is picked up and briefly held at the Environmental Waste Facility.  The waste is picked up by Clean Harbors, a third party contractor, to properly dispose of the waste following all state and federal guidelines.

University of Louisville,2016-02-13,2016-02-13 03:02:59,justin.mog@louisville.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"UofL's Department of Environmental Health & Services (DEHS) promotes (via its website and through on-site training to University maintenance, support, research and clinical personnel) that the best method for chemical waste minimization in laboratories and clinical areas is for each lab, clinic or work area to keep an up-to-date chemical or product inventory control. Product substitution with a non-toxic or less hazardous chemical is also encouraged. Chemical purchases are often reduced by borrowing and sharing chemicals between laboratories. Departments are encouraged to exchange chemicals whenever possible.

The DEHS chemical redistribution program allows lab personnel to identify chemicals that are only partially used and have not exceeded their shelf life or been altered in any way. Some chemicals may be unused and still in the original sealed container. In some cases, these chemicals can be used by someone else at the University. Reusable chemicals collected by DEHS are brought to the central accumulation area, recorded, segregated, and held for redistribution instead of disposal. Each chemical may be reviewed prior to acceptance. The person who receives the chemical is responsible to determine the suitability of the chemical for their use.

In May 2010, DEHS initiated a mercury thermometer exchange program in which UofL employees were encouraged to exchange mercury thermometers for free less-toxic replacements. DEHS ensures that the mercury thermometers were then disposed of properly and the mercury was recycled. The US EPA has identified mercury as one of their waste minimization priority chemicals, making the reduction of mercury a priority.","DEHS has developed a Disposal Guide, available on line at https://louisville.edu/dehs/waste/Guide/toc.html to provide assistance to University personnel in the proper handling and disposal of waste chemicals, or chemical products in the laboratory. Although the guide was specifically written to outline procedures for chemical wastes, it also contains valuable information on many other types of wastes (i.e., radioactive, infectious, asbestos, PCBs, gas cylinders, empty containers, controlled drugs, and waste oils). 
 
Hazardous Waste Training is required of any and all University personnel who may come into contact with or handle hazardous waste in the laboratory setting.  This training is required within the first 90-days of employment and should be refreshed every three years.

All labs where hazardous wastes are generated and managed at the University of Louisville are considered satellite accumulation areas. This is a regulatory designation which allows generators in these areas to operate under the minimum of regulatory oversight. As such, the following five points are all that generators need to know to operate in compliance with the law. It is critical that generators know and understand these points and that they manage their waste in accordance with them:  
•	The container holding the hazardous waste MUST BE marked with the words ""Hazardous Waste"".  No variation of these words is permissible. 
•	The container holding the hazardous waste must be in good condition. This means no cracks, no rust, and no leaks. 
•	The container holding the hazardous waste must be compatible with the waste and any waste mixtures in that container must also be compatible. 
•	The container holding the hazardous waste must be closed at ALL TIMES. The only exception to this is when waste is being added to or removed from the container. 
•	Accumulation of hazardous waste in any satellite accumulation area cannot exceed 55 gallons at any time. If the area accumulates acutely hazardous waste, one quart is the maximum amount allowed to be accumulated. A list of the acutely hazardous wastes is available from DEHS. University personnel are able to request chemical waste pick-up by DEHS online at https://louisville.edu/dehs/waste/disposal.html.

All chemical wastes generated by UofL operations and activities are transported and stored at the DEHS managed Environmental Protection Services Center (EPSC), located at 1810 Arthur Street, Louisville, KY. The Kentucky Division of Waste Management approved the renewal of the hazardous waste management permit (KYO-001-012-012) to the EPSC effective on September 30, 2009.

The EPSC receives waste and stores and/or treats it for eventual shipment to a permitted off-site treatment, storage, or disposal facility. The EPSC also manages such non-hazardous wastes as:
•	Mixed waste
•	Polychlorinated Biphenyls
•	Waste Oils
•	Pesticides/Herbicides not specifically listed or characterized in 40 CFR 261
•	Off-spec or out-dated pharmaceuticals
•	Off-spec or out-dated chemicals not specifically listed in 40 CFR 261 or characteristically hazardous.

Several routine operations are required for the proper handling and shipment as well as control of the waste minimization program and disposal costs. Operations utilized at the EPSC may include, but are not limited to the following:
•	Addition of absorbents to containers for shipment.
•	Lab packing of wastes for shipment to an off-site facility for disposal or treatment.
•	Blending/bulking of compatible materials into larger containers for eventual shipment off-site for disposal or treatment.
•	Stabilization of reactives on a case-by-case basis for storage or shipment off-site.

DEHS solicits proposals to effect the contractual packaging, transportation and management of chemical and hazardous wastes which are generated at all UofL sites.  Management of chemical and hazardous wastes is accomplished through recycling plus disposal or disposal (i.e., incineration). The current selected contractor, Pollution Control Industries (PCI) is a company that is familiar with and adheres to all of the federal, state and local regulations pertaining to hazardous wastes. The contract term is for the period on one year beginning on the date of award with an option to renew for up to four additional one-year periods, all parties concurring. The acquisition of these services is made by competitive negotiation procedures in accordance with KRS 45A.085. Contractor evaluation criteria include: previous hazardous waste disposal projects; recycling/disposal facilities owned, operated and controlled by the contractor; actual waste recycling or disposal options, i.e. recycling, fuels blending, incineration, or innovative new technologies; ability to handle all waste streams/use of subcontractors to handle individual waste streams; proven experience with handling wastes at other colleges and/or Universities;  schedule of standard fees; previous regulatory compliance issues, federal and state violations and subsequent corrective actions and outcomes; and  financial responsibility and liability for services.",N/A,"Laboratory waste at the University of Louisville is managed through the Environmental Protection Services Center, which is a unit within the Department of Environmental Health and Safety. Once a laboratory declares a material surplus or waste, the Hazardous Waste Coordinator will determine if the surplus or waste material can be redistributed to another laboratory instead of being disposed of as waste.  The Hazardous Waste Coordinator evaluates the surplus material and attempts to find laboratories that would like the surplus material. The chemical is then provided to that laboratory as long as the material can be beneficially reused.

EHS provides training on materials management to users of hazardous materials, which includes instruction on waste segregation and minimization. Users are encouraged to seek non-hazardous substitutes over their hazardous counterparts whenever possible.

Any unused, but still usable, materials are brought into the EHS Chemical Redistribution Program, where they are kept available for any further University use, and thus are not disposed of as waste.

EHS operates a Mercury Reduction Program, which helps fund the replacement of elemental mercury-containing devices across campus.

Environmental Health and Safety manages universal waste items (fluorescent lamps and recyclable batteries) for all campus properties.  In conjunction with The Office of Sustainability EHS has established over 100 battery recycling collection areas.  

The University Power Plant has substituted biomass fuel for approximately one third of the coal burned, reducing coal ash production by approximately the same fraction.

EHS has operated a chemical recycling program that takes unwanted excess chemicals from laboratories and returns them free of charge to other interested campus researchers. In 2007, EHS recycled 3,600 chemical containers, which had an avoided purchase cost, adjusted for MU discounts, of $199,700. EHS also recycled 960 pieces of lab equipment (mostly glassware) with an avoided purchase cost of $19,600. EHS also removed 10 kilograms of mercury devices from its facilities and replaced them with non-mercury devices at a cost of $1,400.

Hazardous materials are chemicals that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: ignitability,corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. MU generally uses the most restrictive regulatory definition in identifying hazardous materials. EHS works closely with the Hazardous Materials Management Committee to develop campus policies and review campus issues related to hazardous materials.

","EHS collects and manages unwanted hazardous materials. Campus activities are managed through the designation of Principal Investigators and Supervisors as Registered Users, who are responsible for locations where hazardous materials are used or stored. In addition, EHS monitors these locations to assure that hazardous materials are being handled and stored safely.

To accomplish this objective, the USNH Council on Environmental Health and Safety has developed a Waste Minimization Strategy designed to identify and develop opportunities to control chemical use and reduce waste generation. Various methods have been identified and implemented. These include such actions as:

Purchasing Control: Review of chemical purchases to ensure that appropriate materials and quantities are purchased. This helps to prevent purchasing too much of a material or material of the wrong type that could become a regulated waste.

Periodic Inventory Evaluation: Evaluation of laboratory reagents for current use, transfer to virtual stockroom or disposal.

Surplus List: An online system to match on-campus chemicals with university researchers to avoid the disposal of useful materials.

Environmental Management System: The Solid Waste and Environmental Management Plan (SWEMP) is expected to reduce the volume of the solid waste stream, reduce the toxicity of the solid waste stream, increase re-use and recycling efforts, and promote pollution prevention at the University.","In accordance with the 2009 Hazardous Waste Management Plan, hazardous waste is safely disposed of in several ways. Proper packaging of hazardous waste is necessary to ensure safe transportation from point of origin to ultimate disposal. The selection of appropriate containers helps prevent leaks and spills that may result in human exposure or environmental release during material handling, storage and transport. Routine handling occurs on the campus, in transit to the disposal facility or during the disposal process. The selection of appropriate containers is only to be completed by the Coordinator of Hazardous Waste or the Hazardous Waste Specialist.

In 2012, the University recycled 12,565 kg of spent fluorescent light tubes and 13,881 kg of lead and other metals.

Hazardous waste outreach efforts include a poster for lab entrances, showing proper labeling and containment practices.  On a weekly basis, hazardous waste management specialists visit large generating areas to identify and resolve potential compliance problems, enhance awareness, and reinforce proper procedures.

UNCG has multiple programs to reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated on campus. The Orphan Chemical Program serves as a method to redistribute new or like-new chemicals on campus while being a completely free service to faculty. If the EHS office receives chemicals for disposal that are usable, they are offered to researchers on campus. EHS saves money by not having to dispose of the chemical, and the researcher saves money by avoiding the purchase of that chemical. This program was created in 1998. 

EHS has also worked with the Art Department to install parts washers in their teaching studios to reduce the amount of waste generated through their activities. These are similar to machine parts washers where the students use the solvent to clean brushes and other equipment. The parts washers pump ""clean"" solvent off the top of the solvent drum while the art residues sink to the bottom. The service is provided by SafetyKleen, which provides a closed-loop solvent recycling service for their parts washer service. The solvent is picked up from our site, then recycled and reused in their washers. This service has reduced art waste volume by 60%.  

EHS encourages micro-scale experimentation and computer modeling for research on campus when feasible. EHS also promotes chemical substitution (using less hazardous or even non-hazardous chemicals) and purchasing chemicals in smallest amounts necessary.  

Finally, EHS has now implemented recycling of CFLs from on-campus student residences.  EHS purchased several CFL recycling displays and placed them around UNCG to collect CFLs from student use.  This service is a further effort to collect 100% of mercury items discarded on campus.  ","The UNCG Hazardous Waste Management Policy requires all personnel to dispose of chemical waste safely and in accordance with all Federal, state, local regulations. The Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHS) ensures that all chemical/ hazardous waste is disposed of or treated at a Federal Part B Permitted disposal facility (TSDF). Our laboratories operate as satellite accumulation areas. Using this EPA approved tactic, laboratories may only accumulate up to 55 gallons of hazardous waste at any one time. If that limit is exceeded, EHS is required to remove the waste within three days. Some of the larger generators on campus are on weekly pickup schedules to ensure waste does not approach the threshold quantity. 

All waste on campus is required to be stored in secondary containment. EHS operates a state-of-the-art waste storage facility which offers numerous benefits for the safe storage of waste such as complete tertiary containment, separate room segregation, and emergency equipment including a foam suppression system. All hazardous waste is managed by EHS from the point of generation to shipment off-site in accordance with all Federal, state, and local regulations, as well as any TSDF specifications.
 
UNCG uses Federal Part B Permitted chemical disposal facilities for EPA hazardous waste, as well as permitted recycling centers for universal waste. EHS offers hazardous waste training to all generators on campus, and periodically audits the facilities we use for disposal and recycling to ensure compliance on their part. Hazardous waste slated for disposal is stored and managed properly while on campus. EHS performs general environmental inspections of hazardous waste storage areas on campus, as well as weekly inspections of our main storage facility.

Data from 2013-2016 does not report any hazardous release incidents for University of Oregon main campus in Eugene, White Stag in Portland, Pine Mountain Observatory in Bend, Oregon Marine Biology Institute in Coos Bay, or The Shire in Skamania County.","UO Eugene has a hazardous (poisonous) reuse system of chemical reuse database software system.  After logging in using a UO login email, the interested party can check the inventory and check out chemicals. UO has 3000 chemicals in good condition and take an annual inventory, editing things that have not been used.  Chemicals come form all over campus.  When a principal investigator submits a waste request or is a leaving faculty, they are checked if they qualify for a waste reuse program based on demand and supply.  If there is a great demand, is in good condition, and there is room in the program, the chemical has satisfied the 3 factors necessary for approval.  When no longer useful, solid hazardous waste, has to be treated by the DEQ.  They have Treatment Storage Disposal Facility through the state.  They get a EPA identifier and are disposed of in a number of ways (Incinerator, aqueous treatment, solvent recovery, fuels blending for kilns). ",True,True,"UO Eugene http://ba.uoregon.edu/content/disposal . The basic guidelines for Ewaste disposal: 1) If the property is in good condition, other departments on UO campus may need it. Departments are required to post all working surplus property, e-waste and furniture, in good condition on the UO Department Surplus Listing web site for one week. 2) Computers and servers that no longer effectively run a supported operating system version should be transferred to the surplus property warehouse directly without posting to the surplus website.  Materials are segregated and go to Business Affairs, Zero Waste or Campus Waste.  Zero Waste works collaboratively with Business Affairs and sorts Ewaste from recycling. If you still have e-waste property after posting to the surplus listing web site, complete an UO Property Disposition Request Form (PDR) online.  Also do this If an item is not usable. Typical recycling items include paper, cardboard, handbook, materials and go to Zero Waste. Campus operations are paid monthly to pick up office furniture and electronics waste for the Business Affairs office to deliver to their warehouse. Vehicles go to Brasher's auctions NW auto auction and miscellaneous to the warehouse. Ewaste goes through Business Affairs and is defined as property that can be plugged in or has batteries.  A big portion of Ewaste are refrigerators. http://ba.uoregon.edu/content/disposal. As mentioned in the guidelines, it is required to post the item to the self-serve surplus (surplus.uoregon.edu) website by completing a UO Property Disposition Request Form (PDR) online. This does not need to be approved as long as it is a UO item.  A document number is generated Instructions on completing the PDR form.  Instructions include: contact information and item description; disposal reason; date reported the working/usable property; if it has a Banner Number (green barcode to indicate a fixed asset; if property was purchased with Federal (Fed) funds, Gift funds or is a leased piece of property; if 4 working monitors, group them together on the same line; Keep the working and non-working items on separate lines; do not combine e-waste and furniture on the same PDR; Keep a copy of the PDR for your own files;  forward the PDR to BAO Surplus Property/Oregon Hall. The items stay in the department until requested and on the website for 7 days.  The information will be sent out through BAO news if for a business purpose. For several years, the state required all Ewaste be sent to them, but then the administrative rules changed.  It would cost $50,000 a year.  The benefits of keeping things local include supporting local economy, establishing relationships.  The state would then sell the surplus property and the departments had to pay for the service.  Because this new program is free, departments actually use it.  For several years ago used to have to send things up to the state. Used to cost 50k a year.  Contractor Next Step recycling picks up and refurbishes about 90% of the computers. Zero Waste works collaboratively with Business Affairs and sorts Ewaste from recycling. If an item is not usable, a property disposition request is completed. There are public sales offered by Athletics and the Outdoor Program for where to purchase surplus.  GTF’s can utilize the recycle program listed above.  ","Waste is classified and treated by departments on campus that specialize in that type of waste.  Special instructions are in place for handling dangerous items.  Community partnerships are in place with contractors who come to process the waste after an item is not reused through the surplus system.  Appropriate agencies get involved with toxic waste disposal, such as the Department of Environmental Quality or the Environmental Protection Agency.  File cabinets and other metal objects can be sold as scrap metal.  Profits can go back to departments or a revenue fund if sold through the warehouse.",http://ehs.uoregon.edu/hazardous-waste,--
University of Pittsburgh,2016-03-24,2016-03-24 13:00:21,lwzfm1@pitt.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"1) Pitt's primary strategy is to order only the volume of chemicals that are needed. The cost of disposal of chemicals often exceeds the price of purchasing the chemical.
2) Containers are dated when received and older chemicals are to be used first.
3) Use spirit-filled thermometers instead of mercury thermometers when possible.
4) Use less hazardous or non-hazardous chemicals for experiments when possible.
5) Prepare only the amount of solutions/mixtures needed for experiments.
6) Reduce the number of unknowns by labeling all bottles/containers in lab.
7) Scale down experiments that produce hazardous waste.

These guidelines are intended to ensure that chemical users on campus are aware of the
importance of source reduction and waste minimization. Benefits of source reduction/waste minimization include increased safety of personnel, reduced risk of environmental contamination, and a decrease in waste disposal expenditures.
Pitt's Environmental Health & Safety Department has prepared and implemented a source reduction strategy which describes ways to reduce or eliminate the amount or toxicity of waste.

The following minimization activities are utilized to help reduce the amount and/or toxicity of wastes:
 Product Substitution – Use less hazardous or non-hazardous materials. Examples include substitution of enzymatic cleaners and detergents for chromic acid cleaning solutions, replacement of flammable and or toxic solvents with water based materials, replacing mercury thermometers with spirit filled or electronic thermometers, using latex paints in place of oil-based paints.
 Microscale Chemistry – Scale down techniques where possible to reduce waste.
 One More Step – When possible, all reactions should be taken one more step, if the
additional step will result in a less hazardous material without an increased safety risk.
(refer to Destruction of Hazardous Chemicals in the Laboratory by George Lunn & Eric
Sansone, 2nd Edition, 1994 (Wiley)).
 Waste Segregation – Ensure appropriate segregation. Keep non-hazardous wastes out of the hazardous waste streams. 
 Education – All chemical users should attend Chemical Hygiene training. EH&S offers
additional waste minimization guidance through this program.
 Inventory – Maintain an accurate inventory of chemicals. Ensure that all containers are accurately labeled to ensure that “unknowns” are not generated.
 Chemical Redistribution – Utilize the EH&S Chemical Redistribution Program to donate
or request unused surplus chemicals.
 Purchasing Practices – Only purchase in useable amounts.
 Other Techniques – Elementary chemical neutralization, improved inventory control
practices, and good management and training are all techniques which can be utilized to minimize waste.","All hazardous waste, universal wastes, and non-regulated chemical wastes are disposed of via third party vendors who are  licensed to transport, treat, recycle, and/or dispose of the wastes.",None,"The University of Pittsburgh Chemical Redistribution Program provides faculty and
staff with the opportunity to obtain chemicals free of charge. This program is currently
available to University laboratories located on the Oakland campus. The Chemical
Redistribution Program can reduce expenses for both purchasing and waste disposal.
The program emphasizes the University’s commitment to environmental protection by
reducing the overall volumes of chemical waste generated.
Faculty and staff possessing uncontaminated chemicals that are not expired may donate
these chemicals to the program. Donated chemicals can be claimed by University
faculty/staff members on an as-needed basis. EH&S will maintain an inventory of
available chemicals at www.ehs.pitt.edu. ",True,True,"Institution-generated electronic waste is collected by the University's Surplus Property Department. This group assesses the value of the waste, and takes appropriate steps for proper handling. The waste is either refurbished for sale, donated to non-profit groups, or sent to a certified third party electronics recycling provider (ELoop).","In 2002, a letter was sent to all Deans, Directors, and Department Chairpersons. The letter identified the hazards of e-waste and the steps that should be taken to dispose of it properly in a safe manner. Those who received the letter were instructed to make copies and post it around their workplace for the general dissemination of its ideas.

University of Richmond,2016-02-17,2016-02-17 15:17:47,randreje@richmond.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"A Waste Minimization Plan is recommended by EPA for Small Quantity Generators of hazardous waste. Our plan is targeted at reducing hazardous wastes generated by the sciences, and includes the following steps:

A) Elimination of most P-List (Acutely Toxic) materials from the chemical inventory.

B) Mercury article (thermometers, etc.) exchange program where non-mercury
thermometers were provided to researchers, when suitable replacements existed. Additionally, mercury thermometers which could not be replaced with non-mercury ones, are held in the Chemical Stockroom and checked out for use, preventing spills 

C) Chemical Inventory Reduction and Redistribution Program: The American Chemical Society estimates that unused chemicals can constitute up to 40% of the wastes generated by a lab. Therefore, purchasing and inventory functions are vital to reducing hazardous wastes.

a. Purchasing

Prior to purchasing new chemicals, the Stockroom Manager reviews the inventory to determine if the department has an existing supply of the chemical in the Stockroom. While bulk purchasing may seem less expensive per gram of material, studies have shown that eventual disposal costs drive the price much higher when excess chemicals are purchased., Therefore, when chemical purchases are made, the Stockroom Manager purchases only the quantity required for the research project or instructional experiment.

b. Inventory Management

The Stockroom Manager maintains an accurate electronic inventory of all chemicals in the Gottwald Center for the Sciences. Each chemical is assigned a unique inventory number. A bar coded label is placed on each chemical, with the inventory number and chemical’s date of receipt. Chemical stock is rotated on a first in / first out basis to minimize aging.

c. Laboratory Unit Inventory Review

All Faculty and Staff are encouraged to perform an annual inventory review to
determine if:

All chemicals listed on the inventory are present
All bar-coded chemicals in the lab are listed on the inventory
Chemicals have not deteriorated or aged beyond usefulness
Peroxide-forming chemicals are in good condition, and are tested for peroxides
All chemicals have a foreseeable use, or are returned to the Stockroom (see
below)

d. Return to Stock Program

Many chemical reagents can be used by other laboratories. Even those chemicals deemed too old for research use may be useful in teaching laboratories, where a high level purity is not required. All chemicals which have no foreseeable use in the laboratory unit should be returned to the Stockroom for potential redistribution within the department(s). Those chemicals which are no longer usable will be evaluated for redistribution by a vendor (chemical recycling company), or declared a waste and properly disposed through the hazardous waste contractor. We are in the third year of this program, and we have found that approximately 50% of chemicals returned as part of this program, are suitable for use in teaching laboratories.


We have instituted all of these steps, which allowed the University to reduce the generator status to Small Quantity Generator. This not only eliminated an annual $1000/year fee, but it also reduced labor and transportation costs for waste shipments due to longer allowable on-site accumulation times. An added benefit was the reduction in fuel used by the waste disposal company when they were transporting the wastes more frequently.","Hazardous waste contractors selected for Virginia state contract, extend the same pricing to all universities. The University of Richmond uses Veolia Environmental Services, Inc., to take wastes to EPA Permitted Treatment, Storage, and Disposal (TSD) facilities. We utilize a hierchy of disposal options with starting with recycling then energy recovery and finally incineration as a disposal method. The University of Richmond does not typically utilize land disposal.

Universal waste light bulbs are collected by the Electrical Shop, and maintained in sealed boxes until shipped off-site. To minimize storage issues, fluorescent tubes are crushed in a bulb crusher (equipped with HEPA filter) as allowable by regulation. All fluorescent bulbs are sent to a proper reclamation center.

All wastes are disposed of in accordance with Federal, State, and local regulations.  ","10-17-2013 Power washing was conducted at Scott Stadium without proper capture of the resulting runoff.  The runoff resulted in a white discharge, which was detected in Lodge Creek nearby.  The exact volume of runoff is unknown.   Upon detecting the discharge, the appropriate parties were contacted and they were able to determine that power washing had taken place.  All future power washing was ceased until an appropriate plan for runoff capture was in place.  Now all power washing runoff is vacuumed up before it reaches the storm sewer, with appropriate controls at storm sewer inlets.

11-3-2014 During the startup of Boiler 2R at the Main Heat Plant, at most 150 gallons of lime and water slurry were released from the pollution control system.  Much of the spill was contained, but some entered the storm system.  An air bladder was used to block the affected storm drain.  The University’s vacuum truck was used to flush the affected storm drain. The pH of the closest outfall of the storm system was monitored and it stayed within a normal 6.5-7, indicating that the spill was contained.  The exact quantity released is unknown, but the theoretical maximum was 150 gallons based on the data recorded by the plant control system.  The failsafe, which failed and did not prevent the flow of lime slurry, was repaired.  A runoff study and a project to control storm water contamination was already underway.  Heat plant staff was immediately retrained on the operation of the inflatable air bladder.

12-24-2014 During the afternoon of December 24, the line from the lime slurry pump failed, causing the lime slurry to drain from the tank.  Because it was raining, a storm drain that is normally blocked was opened to prevent flooding at the Main Heat Plant.  The exact volume of slurry released is not known.  The University’s vacuum truck was called in and the affected storm sewer was flushed with 2000 gallons of water.  The next morning, it was discovered that some of the affected storm water reached a nearby stream.  The affected outfall was intercepted and pumped to an adjacent retaining BMP.  Elevated pH levels of 8.5 to 9 were found in the stream initially, which dropped upon intercept of the outfall.  Some dead worms and minnows were observed in the stream.  As mentioned, a larger contamination control project was already underway.  The initial storm sewer inlet, which is normally closed, must now be visually monitored whenever it is open.

Laboratories should attempt to substitute non-hazardous or less toxic materials into their processes and experiments whenever possible. Laboratories should periodically evaluate their chemical inventory and dispose of unwanted/obsolete chemicals and purchase only the quantity of chemicals required for specific projects. To the extent that it does not affect vital research or teaching, laboratories should modify experiments to decrease the quantity of hazardous chemicals used and generated. Spilled chemicals and the materials used to clean up the spills must be disposed of as hazardous waste. Labs use good housekeeping practices to minimize the likelihood of a spill, which can reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated.

Wartburg College,2015-04-27,2015-04-27 09:08:59,anne.duncan@wartburg.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"In 1999 a position was created to care for the details and management of hazardous chemical waste in the science building, then Becker Hall.  While chemistry professors understood the laws of RCRA – Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 , it was difficult to simply add this to the chair’s tasks, in my opinion.  Marilyn Kidd organized large scale hazardous waste pickups of items from Becker Hall.  When I began working here in 2001, I took over the management of hazardous waste and the annual pickups by a licensed waste hauler.  For more details see our CHP – Chemical Hygiene Plan and Hazardous Waste Plan in pdf format under the Security and Safety office on our campus website listed below.

http://www.wartburg.edu/security/hazardous.pdf
http://www.wartburg.edu/security/ChemicalHygienePlan.pdf

The main two steps to reduce hazardous and non-regulated chemical waste is maintaining an accurate inventory of the chemicals in the Science Center and having a more centralized ordering of chemicals as well.  I carry out both of these tasks.  Before 2001 it was common for the professors to order what they needed for labs via purchase order, and soon after I began working here I used a campus credit card and ordered all supplies, chemicals, and specimens used in the biology department.  When Denis Drolet became chair of the chemistry department in 2003, I began to carry out this ordering for that department as well. 

In addition, I maintain a chemical inventory of all the chemical storage locations in the Science Center on my computer as well.  This listing is updated annually.  And when professors need a chemical and a different department already has some in the building, I borrow and move it and put it back, instead of rushing to order more.  This rather low-keyed approach just makes sense.  We also have a storeroom of some acids, alcohols, and acetone that are used by both departments and are purchased one time each year in bulk.

As for the universal wastes, my knowledge of these are the used fluorescent lamps, used oil, and devices which contain mercury (switches, etc.).  The maintenance department and John Wuertz and Scott Sharar are responsible for the campus wide disposal of universal wastes. (To my knowledge.)  They also take care of the biohazardous waste from sharps containers and blood borne pathogen waste cleanups as far as a vendor who removes these wastes from campus.
","The annual disposal of hazardous chemical wastes is budgeted for through the security and safety departments (John Myer) and has been carried out every year since I’ve been here in 2001.  (And it was done a few times before then too.)  I am in contact with professors in the biology and chemistry/engineering science departments directly to train them to gather chemical waste from teaching and research labs and contact me.  They label the bottles (with percentages of each chemical) and I will come pick it up or they can bring it to room 242 where we store hazardous chemical wastes until the annual pickup.  I manage the waste by making a waste determination, filling out Wartburg waste label, filling out waste logsheets, and keeping a running list on an Excel spreadsheet on my computer.  In the summer this spreadsheet is emailed to our licensed waste hauler, CleanHarbors, and they let John Myers know the cost for that pickup.  We set a date for the pickup during summer (when the student, faculty and staff populations on campus are low) for safety’s sake. 

Also, during my chemical inventorying process I will remove older bottles of chemicals and question the departments’ faculty members if these items are still needed.  If not, those bottles of chemicals which are hazardous are disposed of at the annual pickup.  (I either know or ask the other department if they want the chemical and will share it, thus reducing waste.)
",None.,"Wartburg has an inventory system of chemicals within the Science Center for both the Biology and Chemistry departments, but does not have a campus-wide system. However, despite not being campus wide, our system still ensures that we follow RCRA regulations from the EPA for hazardous waste management.
