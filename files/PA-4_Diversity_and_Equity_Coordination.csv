This course meets training requirements for employees mandated by the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act (Campus SaVE Act), which is part of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA), and Title IX (whose training mandates apply to schools that receive federal funding for education programs or activities). The course educates faculty and staff members about sex discrimination and sexual violence, as well as how the school prohibits such offenses, and employee responsibilities to respond. 

Service-related

This program examines the role of managers in creating and supporting American University's commitment to service. It is designed to help organizational leaders identify barriers to service excellence and to provide them with five leader practices to create a service culture. This is a four-hour program for supervisors of service providers.

They are the Safe Space Workshop, the Trans 101 workshop, and the Safe Space 2.0 continuing education sessions.

b. Generations in the Workplace: Veterans, Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, and Millennials—groups whose birth years span eight decades—bring unique values, histories, and attitudes to the office, which can sometimes result in a clash of work styles.

communications with one another. In this session, participants will learn fundamental concepts related to intercultural communication, discuss examples of how these concepts demonstrate themselves in the workplace, and identify barriers to communication and ways to overcome those barriers. 

d. Valuing Diversity and Inclusion
The differences people bring to the workplace can promote tremendous creativity and innovation. Those same differences, however, also can contribute to misunderstandings as we bump up against each other with our different styles and work ethics. This course
creates awareness of how to recognize and appreciate differences leading to more options and better problem solving.

e. Creating Inclusive Communities
Through this reflective workshop, participants will explore how diversity and inclusion impact us personally and interpersonally, as well as at the community and institutional levels. Additionally, participants will develop strategies to incorporate inclusivity into their daily lives.

One group of community members focuses on students, another focuses on faculty.  The college now has a Diversity Council, that was established this spring and is currently developing its mission statement. The Council will focus on qualitative diversity issues that will address climate and retention. ",True,4.0,True,--,True,True,**,"The Dean of the College/Senior Diversity Officer established our Diversity Council, which is broadly representational. One of the charges given to this Council is to deepen the awareness and valuing of human differences throughout the college community; the Council will be responsible for diversity-related programming, as well as for supporting recruitment and curriculum-building.  The letter inviting individuals to become members of this council states the following:  

“The goal of the diversity council will be to address areas of qualitative diversity.  That is, while we will monitor the quantitative results of recruiting and hiring efforts, our focus will be primarily on retaining those individuals who join our community and on educating the larger community about the value of diversity on our campus as a whole.  Our mission will be twofold: to make sure that there is a climate at Connecticut College that allows us to continue to attract and retain students, staff, and faculty from underrepresented groups and to appreciate fully the contribution that these groups make to our College.”

The Dean of the Faculty ensures that Department Chairs receive some programming in diversity-related topics, often at meetings for chairs and program directors or at their annual retreats.  Recently Darald Wing Sue was a keynote speaker at an annual retreat, talking about the topic of his recent book—microaggressions.  There have also been programs on stereotype threat.  Furthermore, the Dean of the Faculty offers a program called faculty@work, a series of lunches during which faculty members present to their colleagues about their recent research.  At times these presentations relate to cultural and other human differences.  All faculty are invited; the typical audience ranges from 15 to 30, and approximately 16 presentations are given each year.

As is true for most colleges and universities, there is a wide gamut of programming on campus, and faculty and staff are invited to attend.  Many speakers present on topics related to diversity and the sites around the world in which different identity groups are engaged in some level of conflict.  Academic departments, our Unity House Multicultural Center, the LGBTQ Resource Center, the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, the Office of Student Engagement and Leadership, the Office of Arts Programming, the Office of Volunteers for Community Service, the Office of Spiritual and Religious Life, and the President’s Office all sponsor programs to expand and deepen cultural awareness and appreciation on campus.

Our Human Resources Office is in charge of professional development for staff; every year there is a series of programs that staff members are invited to participate in.  While some of the workshops are focused on developing computer skills or finding healthy work/life balance, others are focused on cultural competence.  One program in particular that is required for staff, the “Civil Treatment” program (by ELI), includes intensive (8-hr) training sessions for supervisors and separate (4-hr) sessions for employees, with a follow-up “roundtable” session for supervisors held about 6 months after their training.  These sessions are designed to build a civil workplace; they acquaint the participants will anti-discrimination laws and college policies and teach respect for human differences.  Civil Treatment is designed not only to inform, but also to change behavior.

Since its founding, Cornell University has encouraged a culture that provides for the full participation of all members of our campus community—this keeps us at the leading edge in education and in our fields and practices. Cornell University is a place where intercultural skills are developed and enacted among diverse campus constituencies, with community partners, and within room and workplace.
President Elizabeth Garrett reaffirms the university's commitment to diversity regularly in messages to faculty, staff and students. This commitment, is ""central to the university's founding vision,"" ""remains a core value of Cornell and is a key goal of the university's ongoing strategic plans.” She and Provosts Mike Kotlikoff and Laurie Glimcher, dean of Weill Cornell Medical College, are responsible for directing and reviewing annually explicit diversity goals -- through the University Diversity Council (UDC) -- across all university populations to which units and departments will are held accountable.

The UDC has been restructured to represent a wider breadth of the campus community and to incorporate a new approach called ""Toward New Destinations."" It allows colleges and units to tailor their diversity initiatives, based on institutional goals, to their particular needs. 

The restructuring of the UDC includes a new emphasis on measuring results and accountability. A wide range of initiatives and goals have been developed that will help guide the colleges and units in their endeavors. These goals and initiatives represent the full reach of Cornell's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

The university's deans and vice presidents are now required to choose five diversity initiatives annually that best suit their needs and strategic plans and to report on their progress at year's end.

The approach includes diversity initiatives grouped by the core principles of: 
• composition, which refers to the demographic makeup of a unit, such as strategies for attracting and/or retaining more members from underrepresented groups; 
• engagement, which refers to the personal, social and professional commitment to institutional goals and activities, such as developing activities and events that ""promote opportunities for engagement across difference""; 
• inclusion, which involves strategies to improve the campus's multicultural climate and interpersonal relationships; and 
• achievement, which reflects levels of attainment for underrepresented individuals or groups, through, for example, leadership training, honors, awards and other milestones. ",True,9.0,True,http://www.diversity.cornell.edu/,True,True,**,"Cornell University has numerous opportunities on and off campus for individuals from diverse backgrounds to connect with others with the same background or with totally different backgrounds to develop cultural competence. In terms of activities, faculty, staff, students, and community members engage in and host social events, networking groups, and organizations during the course of the academic year. The university and the local community also host events together, such as the Finger Lakes International Dragon Boat Festival, the Annual Sister-Friends Luncheon, and the annual Ithaca Juneteenth Celebration. In addition, Cornell has a number of offices to support diverse communities who sponsored events during the academic year. Offices include: Africana Studies and Research Center; The American Indian Program; Cornell United Religious Work; Cornell Women’s Resource Center; Feminist, Gender, & Sexuality Studies Program; International Students and Scholars office; Latin American Studies Program; Office of Inclusion and Professional Development, Office of Faculty Development and Diversity, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Resource center; Asian and Asian American Center  and Alumni Diversity Programs as well as Diversity Programs in Engineering; the Office of Academic Diversity Initiatives; and the Einaudi Center for International Studies. Cornell Latin America Student Society (CLASS), the Latino Graduate Student Coalition (LGSC), and the Cornell Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) hosted a private screening of the movie: “Cesar Chavez” as part of a fundraising event. Cesar Chavez was a significant Latino civil rights leader who fought for farm worker’s rights to higher wages and person. The Cornell Latin America Student Society (CLASS), along with the Emerging Markets Institute and the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs hosted the event: “Demystifying Public Private Partnerships: A Cornell and World Economic Forum Perspective.” Faculty Institute for Diversity brings tenured and tenure-track faculty together to engage in complex discussions about aspects of diversity creates a network of teachers and scholars who can serve as a resource to one another on matters of diversity and education, and supports faculty in incorporating diversity elements into new or revised courses. Center for Teaching Excellence Diversity Institute (CTE) is offered three times a year, and CTE also provides year round workshops on inclusive practice in classrooms.  Many events are hosted by over 600 student organizations in addition to living learning residential programs such as Ujamaa, Akwe:kon, the Latino Living Center, and the Multicultural Living Learning Unit.
Cornell offers programs to develop cultural competence in both supervisors and employees through the Inclusive Excellence Academy, and regularly assesses the effectiveness of the presentations and workshops.  

The College of Agricultural and Life Sciences requires all students to complete a diversity and inclusion course and many other colleges have distribution requirements that expect cultural fluency.  The Intergroup Dialogue Project idp.cornell.edu has expanded is courses offered to over 200 students every semester to include programs for faculty and for staff members and is taking national leadership in the field.

In terms of training programs, the Supervisory Training Program for Academic Staff has a module dedicated specifically to inclusion and intercultural understanding.

Cornell Interactive Theatre Ensemble (CITE)  is a group of professional actors and facilitators who use theatre to explore diversity and Inclusion.  Their programs create safety around highly charged workplace issues, facilitating honest dialogue, self awareness and organizational learning on four levels: personal, interpersonal, group and institutional/community.  As a part of the university's commitment to inclusion, this year CITE created and ran several sessions of Your Story, My Story, an interactive session aimed to create a deeper understanding of what it means to work in an inclusive workplace, for large units on campus.  Many Cornell employees and work groups have benefited from attending CITE programs (http://www.hr.cornell.edu/life/career/cite.html).

Cornell has established Employee Skills for Success as well as Leadership Skills for Success.  Diversity & Inclusion are included in both sets of skills for success.  These skill sets are at the corner stone of Cornell's performance management process as well as integrated into the design of programs available to all Cornell employees.  In particular, the employee program Turning Point and the Leading Cornell Program, includes these skills for success in their curriculum.

Respect in the Workplace is a simulated on-line training program focusing on real-life situations in the workplace on avoiding harassment and discrimination at Cornell and understanding Title IX. Many units and divisions are making it mandatory for their staff to take the course and departments are being tracked in their completion against the university and other departments.  As of May, 2015, 9,705 individuals, including 72% of our staff, completed the course.  A recently released revised version of this program, titled Building a Culture of Respect, additionally now includes important information on how faculty and staff should respond if they learn a member of our community has experienced any type of sexual violence or stalking. It also lets faculty and staff know how to file a complaint.  

With a focus on the development of multicultural fluency, Cornell University’s Inclusive Excellence Academy, offers programs and access to subject matter experts to advance an inclusive educational environment and workplace. The Academy features customized courses and workshops designed for senior leadership, administrative/college diversity councils, human resource professionals, supervisors and program managers, university constituent leaders, faculty and academic teaching staff, graduate students and postdocs, community partners, and extended community members.

Associate Provost for Diversity and Intercultural Education - Reporting to the Provost, the Associate Provost leads efforts to enhance diversity and intercultural education on Denison’s campus and promotes an institutional culture that values and supports diversity and intercultural education.

Center for Cross-Cultural Engagement - Assumes an active role in developing cross-cultural competence in all students at Denison University. Includes:

Director of Multicultural Student Affairs 
Director of International Student Services
Director, Center for Women & Gender Action

Campus Climate Team - Represents different constituencies of the campus in monitoring and reporting on matters that influence the climate experienced by members of the University community.

Title IX Coordinator


Diversity Strategy Team - The goal of the Team is to help Denison move from a place that is simply diverse to one that embraces difference, intercultural understanding and inclusion as core values.  The team, made up of faculty, staff and students, has been charged with coordinating the production of a report that does three things:

1.   Analyzes and articulates the state of diversity, equity and inclusion at Denison University.

2.   Lists priorities.

3.   Creates an action plan that includes short- and long-term goals.

The initial work of the team will be two-fold: 1) review recently collected student data to assess top priorities and recommend immediate actions and 2) conduct a campus climate study focused on faculty and staff. We want to discern where Denison's efforts toward diversity, equity and inclusion stand. We will ask:

•     What are we doing well?
•     Where are we struggling and need to improve?
•     What changes in the external environment create new opportunities?
•     What changes in the external environment present challenges?

From this analysis, we will determine what priorities for Denison should be at this moment in our institutional history. We will then activate issue-based teams to address specific topics that we deem of highest priority.

Diversity Advisory Committee (DAC) -Mission Statement of the Diversity Advisory Committee:

Through a primary focus on matters pertaining to faculty diversity, the Diversity Advisory Committee seeks to assist the College in conceptualizing a clear vision for diversity at Denison during each stage of the College’s history and institutionalizing this vision in the structural arrangements, policies, procedures, programs and daily life of the College.  It is critically important that faculty play a meaningful role in assisting the College in pursuing its Mission to “educate critical thinkers, discerning moral agents and active citizens of a democratic global society” (Denison Mission Statement).   The importance of diversity to this mission is well articulated in Denison’s statement on the educational value of diversity, adopted by the faculty in 2007.  It states: “Denison is committed to the idea that our community should include people from a wide range of religious, cultural, ethnic, racial, gender, sexual orientation and socio-economic backgrounds in order to realize the goals of a liberal arts education . . . Diversity in all facets of the university has educational value for all students and benefits all members of the campus community”.  (Diversity at Denison:  http://www.denison.edu/about/diversity.html.  The establishment of the Diversity Advisory Committee links the faculty’s distinct understanding of and contribution to the academic mission of the College with the Provost’s Office to inform, advise, and assist in the formulation and implementation of the College’s commitment to developing and sustaining a community where 1) faculty of all social identities can participate, contribute, and thrive; 2) core values of learning in the liberal arts context are promoted through a diversity of faculty identities, perspectives, pedagogies (See Diversity at Denison:  http://www.denison.edu/about/diversity.html); 3) The tensions that arise in any diverse community are met pro-actively and compassionately—informed by the multiple intellectual traditions that constitute the College; and 4) where, we not only address conflicts with insight and courage, but we vigorously affirm and celebrate the many ways we learn from our diversity and that of the society.

Purpose:

To assist the Provost’s Office by working regularly with the Associate Provost, designated to have primary oversight with respect to faculty diversity so that there is a broad spectrum of faculty perspective and insight available to the Provost’s Office for the purpose of formulating, planning, and implementing faculty diversity initiatives at Denison.

This work will include, but is not limited to: 

--Making recommendations to the Provost on matters pertaining to faculty diversity.

--Working with the Associate Provost to guide and offer recommendations regarding hiring, recruitment, and retention of faculty as it relates to diversity

--Assisting in the development of programs, policies, procedures and initiatives relating to faculty diversity

--Interfacing and collaborating with other faculty, committees and governance bodies on campus on issues pertaining to faculty diversity.

--Developing, facilitating or engaging in program implementation pertaining to Faculty Diversity

--Developing or linking the institution to appropriate consultants, experts, and consultative processes and tools (e.g. diversity assessment processes, intervention strategies, etc.)

--Developing approaches to acknowledge, affirm, and recognize the work that we do toward building a thriving community that honors diversity.

Mentoring Matters:  Intentionally Learning with and from Our African American Male Students. Co-Sponsored by the Office of the Associate Provost for Diversity and Intercultural Education; the Center for Learning and Teaching, the Center for Cross Cultural Engagement, the Office of First Year Programs, the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, and Men & Mentoring at Denison.

Purpose:  To provide a one-day workshop dedicated to helping faculty and staff 
better understand ways to effectively mentor Denison’s African-American male students, giving special attention to issues and questions around teaching, learning, and creative/research collaborations (either in small pods or one-to-one) and the ways these collaborations present distinct opportunities to intellectually (and holistically) support and affirm college-aged African-American men. 

Intended Outcomes:
•	To invite participants to reflect critically on and initiate the process to re-frame potential assumptions, biases, and/or cultural/social blind-spots that may negatively affect the development of potential mentoring relationships/collaborations with Denison’s black male students;   

•	To help participants develop familiarity with research-based insights into African American males’ cognitive processes and cultural experiences and the ways these may impact students’ understanding of and engagement with “college”;

•	To model for participants ways to connect research-based learning and teaching practices to holistic issues (social, cultural, spiritual) in order to provide a fuller picture of the kinds of motivation that might positively affect black males’ learning in college; and

•	To prompt participants to identify and begin to imagine executing initiatives to promote and sustain on-going, genuine intellectual mentoring relationships between faculty/staff and black male students (i.e., Summer Research, Senior Research, Research Pods/Teams, Other Models/Contexts).

The Human Resources Department offers diversity training every three to five years.  The trainings are conducted by Career Growth Associates.  These trainings are open to all employees of the college.  Cultural awareness and respecting a diverse work environment are the foci of these trainings.

The Black Studies Program at Denison offers diversity trainings on a yearly basis for faculty with the main emphasis being on pedagogy, race, and sexual identity.

In addition, the Committee on Race and Diversity is charged with fostering better relations among diverse racial and cultural groups at MIT and helping the community realize the benefits of its cultural and racial diversity.

-Stimulate and coordinate a systematic action agenda for improving race relations within the MIT community, including programs, events, and activities that foster appreciation of the many races and cultures at MIT (inside and outside the classroom), and/or that are designed to help eliminate bigotry or prejudice on campus.
-Develop, maintain, and promote a monthly calendar of campus activities and events directly involving or relating to issues of race relations, and serve as a clearinghouse of information on such activities.
-Develop and distribute a resource guide containing information on various services, programs, individuals and organizations that can be of help in promoting positive race relations for the MIT campus.
-Administer a modest grants program to support projects and activities that promote multicultural understanding and positive race relations within the MIT community.

The Mills College Diversity and Social Justice Committee (DC)  promotes diversity and social justice within every aspect of the academic, co-curricular, residential, and administrative life of the College. To that end, the DC works to create proactive, sustainable strategies to generate and institutionalize attention to diversity in relation to race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity, religious, and spiritual beliefs, class, age, color, sexual orientation, ability, immigrant status, and national origin. The DC also works to address inequalities arising from any differential distribution of power, resources, and privilege at Mills, and to support initiatives that enable students, faculty, and staff to engage in social change leading to a more just and inclusive society.

Diversity and Social Justice Statement

Mills College embraces diversity and social justice as key components of academic, co-curricular, and residential life. The College encourages every member of our community to embrace this vision and to work to attract, support, and retain students, faculty, and staff who reflect the diversity and social justice values of Mills.

Diversity refers to the variety of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity, religious and spiritual beliefs, class, age, color, sexual orientation, disability, immigrant status, and national origin. Social justice refers to a commitment to challenging social, cultural, and economic inequalities imposed on individuals arising from any differential distribution of power, resources, and privilege at Mills and in the larger society.

Since its founding, Mills College has remained committed to empowering women to overcome the social barriers that have excluded them from educational and career opportunities. In the 20th century, Mills recognized the importance of extending this access to women from diverse backgrounds, including resumer women, parenting students, and first-generation college students. In addition, Mills graduate and professional programs are designed to provide a coeducational environment that values women's leadership and promotes gender equality. Because the College aims to educate all students to acquire the knowledge and skills to effect thoughtful changes in a global, multicultural society, we seek to create opportunities for engagement in activities that promote equity and justice.

Mills honors freedom of expression and respectful discourse as fundamental educational cornerstones. We recognize that students learn best in an environment that is safe for disagreement, recognizes and addresses diverse learning styles, and values holistic growth and wellness.

Mills recognizes that diversity and social justice are inextricably linked to academic excellence and innovation. Critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, creativity, and collaboration are all enhanced when a diverse faculty and student body interact and learn from one another. By offering a traditional liberal arts curriculum while engaging new pedagogies and diverse perspectives, Mills provides a transformative educational experience that prepares students for excellence and effective leadership in their careers, professions, and in graduate education.",True,6.0,True,http://www.mills.edu/diversity,True,True,**,"Programs implemented and planned include workshops on transgender inclusion practices, a listening session for students to share their experiences with faculty, a campus forum on our journey from a diverse community to an inclusive community, and a panel discussion on social change through student activism.

Office of Equity Concerns
Oberlin College is committed to creating an institutional environment free from discrimination and harassment for students and employees. Thus, discrimination and harassment based on the following categories are prohibited: race, color, sex, marital status, religion, creed, national origin, disability, age, military or veteran status, sexual orientation, family relationship to an employee of Oberlin College, and gender identity and expression.1

The Office of Equity Concerns recommends policy, practices, and programs that serve to ensure that services and quality of campus life are supportive of the mission of the college. The office provides information on college policies, practices, and grievance procedures to any member of the campus community and makes referrals to other appropriate offices and committees.

For information on resources, reporting, and grievance procedures related to sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and intimate partner violence, please see the Sexual Offense Policy. For information on reporting and grievance procedures related to discrimination and harassment, please see the Policy on Discrimination and Harassment.

Meredith Raimondo serves as the Special Assistant to the President for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and Title IX coordinator.

1. In affirming the prohibition against discrimination and harassment on these bases, Oberlin College also affirms its compliance with applicable laws. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older.

Priorities include developing curricula, assessing campus-wide policies and programs, and improving access to rich and holistic academic and student development programs.

In terms of community outreach, members of the PCD have participated in events held at the Plymouth United Congregational Church and the Independent Lens Community Cinema, among others.

As a public university, PSU has a special responsibility to work for equity and social justice and to make PSU programs truly in conjunction with our diverse constituents. The DAC was formed to support these overall goals. The charge of the DAC is to:  (a) Advise and report to the President and Provost on issues related to diversity.  (b) Recommend to the President and the Provost the allocation/redirection of resources that support diversity initiatives and commitments.  (c) Support curricular and pedagogical efforts to incorporate diversity and equity.  (d) Foster research on issues related to diversity, equity and tribal sovereignty.  (e) Create a welcoming and safe place for all persons.  (f) Strengthen linkages with communities of diversity in the region.  (g) Promote significant structural changes at PSU to support service to diverse constituents.  (h) Seek outside funding sources to supplement and enhance the activities and programs of the DAC.  (i) Design and oversee an assessment process to monitor progress on implementing the Diversity Action Plan.  (j) Promote activities throughout the campus effectively addressing issues related to diversity.  (k) Recognize and honor exemplary actions that contribute to a campus climate supportive of diversity.

Our mission is guided by three simple and powerful truths:
1.	We are educating global citizens. Students in the 21st century live in the global world and must learn to think beyond the boundaries of the nation state. Consequently, we have a responsibility to prepare students to become citizens of the world. By enabling students to successfully participate in a diverse society, we can achieve a global community that's equitable and just for all.
2.	Diversity contributes to critical thinking skills. Students who develop the ability to understand alternative perspectives tend to show greater empathy and have a better capacity to solve complex social problems. They're also better prepared to take on leadership roles as decision makers and facilitators by negotiating different perspectives. That's why it's important for us to create both formal and informal environments where students can learn the issues related to diversity. 
3.	Knowledge Serves the City. The first two truths serve the third, which is the foundation for Portland State University's motto Let Knowledge Serve the City. We're proud to be an active and contributing partner with the city we call home. It's why we're committed to connecting with diverse communities and serving our greater urban society.”
",True,5.0,True,http://www.pdx.edu/diversity/,True,True,**,"PSU Faculty, staff and students made clear they are eager to embrace efforts to create a climate that values diversity and exemplifies mutual respect.
At the same time, many pointed out that it can be difficult to know how best to respond to sensitive situations involving workplace and campus behavior – and asked for additional learning tools to assist you in that regard.  We now have such a tool:  an on-line education learning module available for all employees entitled: “Creating a Culture of Respect: Preventing Prohibited Discrimination and Unlawful Harassment.”
All faculty, staff and student employees have been asked to complete the learning module in order to advance our efforts to make Portland State University a more inclusive place to work and learn.”

Rice University’s Mission Statement, which establishes the basic framework for diversity and inclusion in all of Rice’s endeavors states, “As a leading research university with distinctive commitment to undergraduate education, Rice University aspires to path breaking research, unsurpassed teaching, and contributions to the betterment of our world. It seeks to fulfill this mission by cultivating a diverse community of learning and discovery that produces leaders across the spectrum of human endeavor.” Thus, in order to be successful in fulfilling its mission of inclusive excellence, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion commits itself to acknowledging differences within Rice’s campus, seeking critical mass for underrepresented populations, and enriching Rice’s learning environment.

The program focuses on encouraging students to speak up against prejudice and some of the thoughtless things people tend to say, with an eye towards maintaining relationships and Rice’s much-valued sense of community. 

(2) Sexual Harassment Training and other Discrimination: 
Rice's Office of Diversity and Inclusion has an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action/Human Resources working group that has offered a number of cultural competence training events for students: 
-They administered online sexual harassment training to an increasing number of the Rice community. Last summer they were able to send invitations to the entire freshman class resulting in a 100% participation rate.

ADVANCE seeks to create an environment at Rice that emphasizes unity by embracing individual differences and is committed to providing a safe space to students interested in dialoguing on the often divisive issues of the day. 

(4) Culture Fair: The OMA and ADVANCE sponsor Culture Fair each spring.  The fair enjoys huge support each year and averages about 300 attendees each year.

The Panel on Faculty Equity and Quality of Life (rotational membership, comprised of faculty members from different schools) administers the Faculty Quality of Life Survey, and also collects and assesses data from the university’s seven schools concerning non-salary forms of compensation and support.

In addition, the the Diversity & Access Office was created to advance Stanford University's equal opportunity and affirmative action goals and commitment to diversity. Our office ensures University compliance with federal, state and local regulations concerning non-discrimination and disability access. 

To accomplish our mission, we work collaboratively with Vice Presidents, Deans, Department Chairs, Administrative Managers and Human Resources staff who have direct responsibility for achieving the University's objectives.

Our office provides an array of services and resources designed to ensure equal opportunity and address bias and discrimination prohibited by law or official University policy, as well as assists individuals with disabilities who have requests for accommodations in the workplace and to access Stanford facilities, programs and activities.

STUDENTS:

Stanford University was originally founded as a tuition-free institution and has a history of supporting the education of first generation and/or low-income students. The Office of Financial Aid keeps this spirit alive with its generous need-based financial aid packages.

In April of 2011 Stanford created the Diversity and First Gen Office to support the campus life of first generation and/or low income students. It uses office initiative and campus partnerships to promote a supportive academic environment. It also offers leadership in the integration of socio economic issues into campus diversity programs. Here at the Diversity and First Gen Office we continuously seek ways to foster a successful and collaborative university setting.

The Diversity and First Gen Office's mission is creating an interconnected Stanford community.

Specifically, the Diversity and First Gen Office builds student capacity and confidence to become interconnected with people from different backgrounds.  Our contribution to Stanford’s diversity landscape is to provide campus leadership in addressing life with multiple identities and inter-group relationships that overlap with social class.  Within this mission is a special focus on enriching the experience of first generation college students by supporting their transitions, empowerment, and community building.

Instead, the training offers abbreviated insight into LGBTIQ issues and an introduction to the tools necessary to be an effective LGBTIQ ally.

Upon completing the training, participants have the option of agreeing to be an ally and thus are identified by an ALLY decal displayed on their office or residence hall doors. The symbol provides a message to members of the LGBTIQ community that the person displaying the symbol has completed the training, has decided to be an active and visible ally, can be trusted to maintain confidentiality, and will respond to the individual with understanding, support, and empathy.  

Undoing Racism
Student Organized Against Racism (a student Organization ) works with several offices to cosponsor  the Undoing Racism™/Community Organizing Workshop (twice a year).  This  unique workshop is offered by The People’s Institute, a national, multiracial, anti-racist network dedicated to ending racism and other forms of institutional oppression. The People’s Institute moves beyond a focus on the symptoms of racism to an understanding of what it is, where it comes from, how it functions, why it persists and how it can be undone. The workshop’s systemic approach stresses learning from history, developing leadership, maintaining accountability to communities, creating networks, undoing internalized oppression, and understanding the role of organizational gate-keeping in perpetuating racism. Students and members of students organizations are encouraged to attend the workshop. SOAR can be contacted via email: SOARTU@gmail.com.

Although their names are similar, their missions are distinct. Both offices are concerned with diversity and fairness, but each office works to achieve these goals in a different way.  

The office of the Vice Provost for Equity and Inclusion plans, coordinates and monitors UB’s efforts to institutionalize the culture of equity and inclusion university-wide.  The office does this by promoting excellence in all aspects of UB’s operations by facilitating processes that remove barriers to access and advancement on the basis of race, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or veteran status for students, faculty and staff. Excellence—embracing and exhibiting the highest level of quality in research, teaching and service—can be achieved only when diverse perspectives are engaged. 

The Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion ensures UB's compliance with policies covering discrimination, harassment, accommodations, equal opportunity and child protection.   They do this by working to:
-Provide assistance in the University’s goal to promote diversity and a climate welcoming of a diverse faculty, staff, student body and the University community.
-Effectively oversee policies governing discrimination, harassment, reasonable accommodation, religious accommodation, child protection and recruitment.
-Ensure that issues of harassment, discrimination and accommodation are addressed in a timely and effective manner that does not tolerate retaliation.
-Assist the University in its commitment to foster and sustain a working and learning environment where each member of the community can succeed.


In addition, The Equity & Inclusion Council is composed of faculty, administrators, staff, students and alumni, and supports the diversity and inclusion work in several important ways.  The Council:
-Represents a broad cross-section of the University Community, and can therefore assist the VPEI in communicating effectively across UB’s campuses and constituencies
-Ensures that the VPEI’s priorities reflect the consensus of those invested in equity and inclusion on campus
-Broadens the scope of discussion of equity and inclusion initiatives at UB beyond a single individual
-Partners with the VPEI to seek input from a range of relevant stakeholders whose activities need to be coordinated

It was specifically created in response to a charge issued by Chancellor Paula Allen Meares to serve as a foundational course and one that would support UIC’s diversity strategic plan (Goal 3: states that UIC will have a climate of diversity and equity in which individual students feel welcomed in their identities, valued for their contributions, and feel their identities can be openly expressed). Eight undergraduate colleges have endorsed/supported this course an elective for their students, while one has accepted it as a requirement for all entering freshmen.  UIC's First-Year Dialogue Seminar (1 credit hour) is a diversity course focusing on the development of critical thinking skills and learning from diversity and dialogues. The course introduces students to theory and empirical findings from a variety of disciplines concerning diversity, culture, identity, and intergroup dialogue. The course also provides a formal introduction to UIC diversity initiatives, campus resources and programs (e.g., UIC Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change).

",http://diversity.missouri.edu/learn/training/,"The University of Missouri (MU, or Mizzou) has made great strides in increasing the diversity of our campus community and nurturing an inclusive campus climate for faculty, students and staff.  The broad range of life experiences, values, cultural practices and perspectives in our community establishes an institutional foundation for innovative learning and discovery.  It further expands the university’s ability to become a globally-recognized epicenter for education, research and entrepreneurship.

As a comprehensive research university, it is essential for our scholarship to reflect our commitment to diversity.  Faculty all across campus are actively engaged in research that contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of human experiences, and integrates academic research with the world of policy and action.  Researchers are tackling such issues as: Black women’s working-class activism and the politics of urban decline; lottery funded scholarships and their effect on access and retention of minority students; designing adaptive clothing for individuals with disabilities to decrease stigma; and creating technology to enhance aging in place.  Diversity research is enriched by the work of faculty in the Black Studies and Women’s and Gender Studies departments, as well as research centers such as the Cambio Center, Center on Religions and the Professions, the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, the Afro-Romance Institute for Languages and Literatures of the African Diaspora, and the Vietnam Institute, among others.  Diversity in Action, a program of the Chancellor’s Diversity Initiative (CDI), showcases new diversity research in a monthly seminar format.

We believe that our curriculum must offer courses that will prepare all of our students for the increasingly multicultural 21st century. Our schools and colleges are committed to infusing discipline-relevant diversity into the curriculum.  This has resulted in such groundbreaking efforts as the Trulaske College of Business’ Global Mindset and Multicultural Learning Map and the College of Education’s Personal Transformational Pathways. And our students actively seek out a diversity curriculum: an estimated 8000 undergrads are currently signed up for MU’s Multicultural Certificate program which gives credit for a multitude of courses, including, for example:  Global Animal Agriculture, Blogging the World: the Web in Cultural Context, African Diaspora Folklore, and Theory and Practice of Theatre of the Oppressed.   The MU International Center offers more than 300 study abroad programs; and a record 1,371 student studied abroad in 2012, making the University one of only 66 campuses in the country to send more than 1,000 students abroad annually.

Diversity extends to our student body and to the many co-curricular opportunities we offer.  The Disability Center, Multicultural Center, Black Culture Center, Women’s Center, LGBTQ Center, and Veterans Center provide support and leadership development for the growing number of demographically diverse students and allies we enroll.  Student organizations run the gamut from professional organizations (National Association of Black Accountants, National Association of Hispanic Journalists), to affiliation groups (Triangle Coalition, Legion of Black Collegians, Muslim Student Organization) to service organizations (Peer-to-Peer, Enhanced Leaders Inspiring Through Excellence).  These student organizations greatly expand our diversity programming and events on campus.

At MU, inclusion and equity are more than a matter of compliance.  The University of Missouri is dedicated to creating and maintaining an environment in which no individual is discriminated against based on their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, age, disability, or status as a veteran.  But that’s our floor, not our ceiling.  We want all members of our community to feel welcome at Mizzou and to understand their responsibility for making our institution a welcoming place for others.

We are pleased with our progress in improving the ability of members of our community to function successfully in a multicultural climate given that often people are not prepared to deal with others whom they perceive as different from themselves.  The Chancellor's Diversity Initiative offers such innovative programming as Diversity 101, a four-week interactive web-based class; Workplace Diversity, a monthly brown-bag skill-building workshop; and superb online professional development modules on conflict resolution and respectful workplaces.  We reach into the classroom to improve instructors’ cultural competency through our Difficult Dialogue fellows, Guide to Religions (with dates for necessary classroom accommodation), universal design and teaching tips for an inclusive classroom.

In 2009, the committee was asked to identify two to three initiatives based on the data collected from two years of panels and open forums. The Chancellor requested that this group submit recommendations in the form of a proposal with a budget for her review and approval. In addition, the Chancellor requested this group to consider carefully the title for a senior position that would provide leadership for the Office of Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion. Finally, this group was requested to determine what current programs on campus might be ideally placed under the administration of this office.  

The 2012-13 committee was charged to work on completing a more comprehensive Inclusive Excellence/Diversity statement that could be supported by the university. It was agreed upon that the statement would include the following: request that diversity/inclusive excellence be infused into class syllabi through diverse scholarly materials, diversity workshops, scholarly projects engaging inclusive excellence linked to the university mission and QEP initiative, and learning communities. Chancellor Brady reaffirmed her full support and commitment to the inclusive excellence /diversity initiative for the entire campus. She proposed three additional items to the committee for consideration in the 2012-13 academic year:

1. Consider town hall conversations clustered around disciplines about why diversity and inclusion is important in recruiting, the nature of climate, etc.  One approach would be to conduct four (4) town hall sessions (one area each session) social sciences, sciences, arts and humanities and the processional schools – talk through challenges and opportunities with faculty. The critical topic is infusing diversity and inclusion in to the classroom and across disciplines to ultimately weave inclusiveness into the fabric of the university;
2. Invite someone well known in the area of diversity and inclusion to do workshops with faculty, particularly, someone with experience and success in this area; and 
3. Climate/Customer Service – figure out a way to present a more welcoming approach when engaging with students and visitors to our campus. Implement the “rule of two”, students and visitors should not engage with more than two people to get an answer. Customer service should not vary based upon color, age, etc.  

The Chancellor closed with two important statements:  “We must address the curriculum piece…imbedding diversity/inclusive excellence in the academic structure, in order to see change. Anything short of this and we will continue to chip away at the edges and never advance the initiative."" Her closing comment sums up her commitment to this initiative “…inclusive excellence is not an add-on, it is important for the future (of the university). We have to work with faculty and help everyone understand why this is important, and bring them to the table for serious discussion related to this topic.” 

Beginning with the 2013-14 academic year, the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee for Equity, Diversity and Inclusive Excellence established their own goals and objectives for the year. This was a shift from the standard process in which the Chancellor charged the committee to review and report on different matters with recommendations for implementation. A major initiative developed and implemented in 2013-14 by the committee was the “Campus Community Dialogues” the first of which was focused on “Hate Speech”.  This dialogue was the result of an incident that occurred in the library and the subsequent campus community concerns and desire to come together to openly address this issue and create two annual forums one per semester to engage the campus in dialogue. The goal of the committee was to provide a safe venue where faculty, staff, students and the surrounding community could gather to voice their opinions and reactions in a positive manner in hopes of creating change on our campus. This forum proved to be very successful as it not only garnered support from the campus community, we also had community leaders and other institution’s staff and students in attendance. 

Sub-committees Research Objectives 2013-2014
 
The 2013-14 committee was also divided into three sub-committees charged to conduct a final review and provide recommendations on the following areas: 

1)  Employee Recruitment and Hiring Process; 
2)  Faculty Recruitment, Retention, and Promotion and Tenure; and 
3)  Undergraduate and Graduate Student Recruitment, Retention and Graduation.

Shades of Color Conference: An annual event that aims to create a safe, empowering, inclusive space for all community members of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to discuss, reflect on and mobilize around issues of multiculturalism. A sense of awareness about intersecting social identities and the relationship between campus and other communities are both central to the goals of the event. We strive to proactively create change through motivating, informing, and challenging individuals to address social justice issues, both personally and within their communities.

Contemporary Issues Forums: These provide an avenue to participate in discussions around ""hot topics"" in a multicultural society. Discussions are led by faculty and staff from across the university and serve to introduce people to a particular topic as well as engage in in-depth analysis of its most important issues. Past topics include: ""Is This a Post-Racial America?"", ""Post-Feminist America?"", ""American Indian Mascots: Why All the Hype?"", and ""Conservative Blacks and Black Conservatives: There are Differences.""

Human Rights Week: This event is an opportunity for the UNCG community to focus on human rights issues domestically and abroad. The week is organized by the Office of Multicultural Affairs in partnership with various student organizations, academic departments and community organizations. The most recent week of events addressed issues of immigrant health outcomes, tribal sovereignty, human trafficking, and LGBT equality.

Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration: The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is celebrated every year with a week of events offered to inspire and challenge the university community to continue to strive towards the ideals of peace and justice. The highlight of the week is the annual MLK Celebration in which an invited speaker delivers a keynote address in the spirit of Dr. King’s legacy. Past speakers include Rev. Al Sharpton, Angela Davis, and Dr. Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel in space. During the same event the MLK service award is presented to a member of the UNCG community who has gone above and beyond their role at UNCG and has truly lived Dr. King’s vision. 

UNCG's Human Resources Department also offers workshops and training opportunities (please see: http://workshops.uncg.edu/). Examples of cultural competence topics include ""Intercultural Sensitivity: Looking Through Other Eyes"" and ""Ouch! That Stereotype Hurt.""
