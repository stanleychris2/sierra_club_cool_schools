UC Supports Work Standards
The University of California intends to join the Fair Labor Association while continuing its membership in the Worker Rights Consortium, two organizations that maintain oversight of working conditions for the manufacture of various products, announced the Office of the President.
The action is part of UC's ongoing effort to improve labor practices in companies that produce consumer products bearing the University's logos and trademarks, said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance. The University has licenses with more than 200 companies, including Adidas, Gear for Sports, Jansport, and Nike.
Since August 1998, UC has followed a code of conduct for trademark licensees that manufacture consumer products bearing University logos and trademarks. The code specifies for University licensees and contractors minimum workplace standards and practices related to legal compliance, ethical practices, and employment standards. In January 2000, the University strengthened its code as a result of suggestions from an advisory group of faculty, students, and administrators.
A copy of the UC code of conduct is available at http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/policy/1-05-00code.pdf.
""Assuring compliance with our code requires open and honest dialog with manufacturers and workers, and a system of monitoring workplace conditions,"" Mullinix said. ""Currently, there is no fully developed monitoring program on which the University can rely to assure licensee compliance with the code.
""However,"" he added, ""the University is committed to work energetically towards a system that provides an assurance that compliance is being achieved….The University is looking forward to working with both the Worker Rights Consortium and Fair Labor Association on these important issues,"" said Mullinix.

Dear Mr. Nova:

	The University of Louisville is committed to conducting our business fairly and in a socially responsible manner.  We understand that part of our mission involves educating the next generation of leaders as well as standing up for those in our community and around the world who face challenges in life.  This mission includes advocating for fair labor practices, a commitment we share with the WRC and the Fair Labor Association.

	The University of Louisville also supports the principles of the Designated Suppliers Program.  Specifically, we support the concept of acceptable working conditions, living wages and freedom of association for workers who manufacture university apparel.  While we support those principles, UofL shares the concerns of other institutions regarding the ongoing economic, logistical and possible anti-trust challenges facing the implementation of the DSP.

	The University of Louisville looks forward to hearing more about the future of the DSP and may ultimately adopt the program providing the challenges noted above are addressed to our satisfaction.  Thank you for your efforts to promote fair labor standards across the globe.  UofL stands ready to assist in this effort.

Sincerely,
