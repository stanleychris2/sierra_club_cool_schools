Relevant workshops:

307: More Than a Scenic Backdrop: The AU Campus as a Teaching and Learning Resource: The AU campus is a natural treasure. It is an accredited arboretum and recognized as one of the most beautiful and well-tended college campuses in the country. This landscape is more than a scenic backdrop: It can be an exceptional resource for experiential learning. This panel brings together faculty and staff in an imaginative and interactive discussion about how AU’s Arboretum and Gardens can be, and have been, integrated creatively and effectively into classes. The campus environment lends itself well to exploring such topics as biodiversity, water management, sustainable development, and urban agriculture. Memorable moments in the University’s history also can be revisited in the arboretum: for example, President Kennedy’s 1963 commencement speech. Following the presentations, panelists and the audience brainstorm about opportunities and connections that can serve to enhance faculty and student familiarity with the campus and enrich the classroom experience.  

407: Teaching Environment and Sustainability across the Curriculum: This session seeks to engage and collaborate with faculty who want to learn about incorporating issues relating to conservation, climate change, and/or sustainability into their courses. These are key challenges of our times and teaching these issues enhances students’ knowledge and capacity to make a difference. Attendees learn strategies for including environmental examples, topics, speakers, projects, assignments, current events, and site visits in any course. Participants who have never taught these topics before but who are interested in interdisciplinary teaching are encouraged to attend. The session focuses upon sharing ideas and discussion of opportunities for including environmental topics across the curriculum.

Due to the workshops at this annual conference, interest has been increasing among faculty, and there has been growth in participation in this program. Discussions about how to expand the offering are underway.","Faculty receive professional development training, free of charge, in this subject area. The Office of Sustainability staff is available to all faculty to provide sustainability tours, data, and other benefits as requested. ",http://www.american.edu/ctrl/conference.cfm,--
Appalachian State University,2016-02-01,2016-02-01 13:37:35,balllf@appstate.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The department of faculty and academic development runs the Learning Communities Leadership Institute, a faculty training program that is held every semester. The workshop aims to help develop learning communities on campus through faculty involvement. Learning communities are trans-disciplinary groups of persons who share a common interest and through a process of collaborative inquiry, learn, develop, and share ideas relevant to accomplishing a specified goal.  An important characteristic of a learning community is that it exists, in large part, to maximize and promote the individual and collective learning of its members. As such, an effective learning community not only illuminates and advances a topic of interest, it also enhances the professional capacity of its members as teachers, scholars, and leaders. It is democratic, inclusive, and collaborative, and genuinely dedicated to fostering learning and community.  

One of the four learning communities at Appalachian State is Sustainability. Through faculty education of the sustainability learning community more classes have incorporated sustainability topics and issues into their lessons. Faculty are made more aware of sustainability programs and how to connect them into their department. Faculty are made more aware of sustainability goals and how to obtain them. Faculty are more equipped to carry out the Strategic Plan which has focuses on increased sustainability throughout campus.",Faculty that are selected receive a $300 stipend upon completion of the five day workshop and all lunches are provided. ,http://fad.appstate.edu/events/2014-learning-communities-leadership-institute,--

Arizona State University,2016-02-29,2016-02-29 15:08:45,corey.hawkey@asu.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability launched its solution-oriented program in academic year 2008-2009.  The goal of this program is to engage students, faculty and community members (e.g., representatives from businesses, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations) in collaborative research on pressing sustainability issues in order to identify joint problems and explore solution approaches to them.  The program incentivizes faculty to develop new sustainability courses or to develop hands-on projects in existing sustainability courses.

Since the creation of the solutions-learning program, the program has grown quickly and has developed both at the undergraduate and graduate level.  In total, there have been 82 solutions-learning courses that have involved 46 distinct faculty members and 2,746 students.  The program and its relevant outcomes have been describe and published as a peer-reviewed article (Wiek, A., Xiong, A., Brundiers, K. & van der Leeuw, S. (2013).  Integrating problem-and project-based learning into sustainability programs—A case study on the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University.  International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education).

Positive outcomes of these collaborations include for instance, the creation of a pilot program for food waste composting on the ASU Tempe campus (SOS 494/594: Urban Composting Systems – Applied Case Studies for ASU, Spring 2011); or the creation of form-based codes for transit-oriented development for the City of Phoenix (SOS 594: Sustainable Solution Options for Phoenix, Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013); or the implementation of a playground design fostering children’s physical movement and cognitive learning for Mountain Park Health Center, providing affordable health care in underserved, low-income communities.
","Through the solutions-learning program, faculty have the support of a “Community-University Liaison”.  This half-time staff position was created to assist faculty in working with local community organizations relevant to their research and teaching areas (in government, for profit, and nonprofit domains), and in designing and implementing real-world projects in sustainability (e.g., project design, coaching students, co-instruction of classes).  To respond to requests for training from faculty, the Community-University Liaison also organizes annual half-day training workshops as well as a lecture series to facilitate faculty exchange about best practices in teaching solutions learning in collaboration with community partners.

Additionally, the School of Sustainability has also funded a half-time research assistantship position to assist faculty with the development of solutions-oriented projects.  For example, this position is assisting with a global classroom experience on urban sustainability that brings together students from ASU and Leuphana University in Germany.  Using videoconferencing and face-to-face exchanges, students from both countries engage in collaborative learning to develop solutions to sustainability challenges in cities in Germany and the U.S.  Given the logistical challenges, the assistantship position has been critical for this program to be successful.

The incentives above are offered to School of Sustainability faculty, but often result in collaborations with faculty in other colleges/schools and courses are cross-listed so that a wide-range of students have access to the courses.

The President of Arizona State University also rewards innovative and socially embedded teaching techniques fostering sustainability competencies with the “President’s Award for Sustainability”.  In the past, this award has been given to faculty for their development of sustainability courses that have had a positive impact on not only students in the course, but the community.

_____Immersive Learning Project Guidelines

• Preference will be given to projects that meet all or most of the characteristics of immersive learning.  See: http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/UndergraduateStudy/BeyondtheClassroom/ImmersiveLearning.aspx
• While preference will be given to new proposals and activities, successful projects previously funded by the Provost’s initiative may apply for funds where need exists and unduplicated students will be served.  New proposals are not necessarily new courses.  Faculty members are encouraged to consider how their existing courses may be made more immersive.

• We will not fund “immersive coordinators” nor new faculty lines. We will not fund overloads.  We will fund buyouts for release time.

• Preference will be given to projects that can become self-sustaining. This is only temporary money. If the project is requesting equipment, please address why new equipment is needed and how it will be maintained. Equipment purchased specifically for immersive learning projects will be turned back to the Provost’s Office if the project is not sustained.
 
• Interdisciplinary proposals involving multiple departments and colleges are encouraged. Proposals should address how students will be recruited and how credit will be assigned.

• Preference will be given to projects that work with one or more community partners.  Letters of support from said partners should be attached to the proposal. Projects involving international travel should provide a signature of support from Dr. Kenneth Holland, Dean Rinker Center for International Programs.

• Projects should involve primarily undergraduate students.  Funds for graduate student support may be available, but the learning outcomes and project activities are to be for undergraduate students.

• All full-time faculty (tenured, tenure-track, and contract) are eligible to apply.  Professional Personnel in collaboration with faculty are also eligible.

• Proposals must be signed by appropriate chairs and deans.  

• Proposals must be accompanied by a brief statement of support from the Department Chair(s) or Center Director(s) that addresses if and how the proposed project a) contributes to the department’s curriculum, b) if the department can meet its curriculum obligations if the faculty member(s) is funded for the project, and c) if the proposed project will be perceived as an appropriate scholarly or creative endeavor for the faculty member(s).

• Proposals will be evaluated by the Immersive Learning Advisory Committee with recommendation to the Provost.  Committee members are available for consultation.  Contact J. Trimmer for information. 

• The proposal is limited to 6 pages, not including the cover memo, letters of community support, or letter of chair support.  Please be succinct and direct.

• Faculty receiving funds are expected to provide a mid-grant report and provide a public presentation of the project upon its completion.

• Faculty will be asked to provide assessment data at the conclusion of the project.  Faculty members who are funded will be asked to use an experimental evaluation form for assessment purposes.

Beloit College,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 13:47:42,chapmanlr@beloit.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Beloit College supports the Pathways to Sustainability Leadership Program.

The aims of Pathways to Sustainability Leadership include:
1) embedding sustainability in the liberal learning of our students;
2) preparing our graduates to exercise environmental leadership in their careers through the development of expertise and individual capacity for action around sustainability;
3) linking learning opportunities—including those associated with campus operations, residential living, and the greater Beloit community—with the creation and implementation of solutions in pressing areas of sustainability; and
4) through this synergy, promoting an intentional long-term approach to sustainable living more broadly and deeply among our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the larger community.

Consistent with the developmental approach taken by Beloit College’s Liberal Arts in Practice curriculum, Pathways to Sustainability Leadership seeks the intentional development of students’ capacities by establishing three tiers of increasingly sophisticated project-based student learning pathways, Sustainability Citizens, Sustainability Fellows, and Sustainability Leaders.

I. Sustainability Citizen opportunities include courses, course modules, residential practices, and work/study opportunities that inspire students to care about sustainability and to develop the tools necessary for responsible citizenship as they assume capacity for action with respect to sustainability.

II. The Sustainability Fellows Program gives students the opportunity to contribute their expertise to a sustainability project on campus or in the Beloit community. Fellows are full-time interns for two months during the summer.

III. Sustainability Leaders Teams are three- or four-member collaborative teams charged with completing a sustainability project that is full-time for two months in the summer or part-time for an entire academic year. Student team members consult regularly with their Faculty and Staff Mentors to discuss their projects, including their ethical, creative, economic, and political dimensions, as well as how others may be persuaded to pursue their recommended solution(s).
During the 2014-15 academic year, the following courses were created or modified to include facets of sustainability, with financial resources from the Pathways to Sustainability Leadership Program.

Professor Linda Sturtz: Topics in North American Environmental History
In this course we will investigate the environmental history of North America, focusing on how humans have interacted with the natural world and how the natural world has shaped human endeavors. We will also analyze how humans have understood their roles within the natural world from the colonial period to the present. In addition to considering classic themes and texts in American environmental history, we will study the history of extinction, focusing on the extermination of the Passenger Pigeon which was once abundant in Wisconsin but became extinct when the last Pigeon died in 1914.

Professor Paul Stanley: Environmental Physics
Students will study how physics can be used to understand environmental issues, how to develop reasonable ""back-of-the-envelope"" estimations of physical phenomena associated with the environment, and how to develop a coherent, critical, physics-based assessment of the environmental impacts of technology. Students will engage in research design and implementation projects related to environmental physics; including lab and field work to verify manufacturer's claims on performance and impact of light bulbs, insulation, and air conditioners as well as doing energy audits. By the end of this course students will have been exposed to the tools to enable them to effectively use physics to address environmental concerns and to have meaningful reasoned dialog with peers and non-scientists on the role of physics in sustainability proposals.

Professor Chris Fink: Writing Wilderness 
This course includes two weeks at Beloit College, reading and writing about wilderness—as a place, a concept, and a state of mind—and a one-week “field work” experience, canoeing, camping, reading and writing in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, on the US and Canadian border in northern Minnesota.

Professor Gabriela Cerghedean: Intermediate Spanish:  Readings in Spanish Civilization, The Culture of Water in Medieval Iberia 
The Culture of Water in Medieval Iberia explores the role and traditional use of water in everyday life, from its material to its symbolic functions. The course explores the innovative techniques used in irrigation, the impact of the hydraulic systems on architecture, landscaping, agriculture and organic farming methods. Another goal is to analyze the main factors, the social relations, values, and ideologies that prevailed, governed, and shaped the ultimate success of al-Andalus in achieving a sustainable way of life. Moreover, we will reflect on alternative views or solutions to present-day sustainability issues.  

Sustainability Leader Teams during the 2014-15 academic  year include:
Professor Jo Ortel, Contemporary Art in an Age of Global Warming
Jo Ortel’s Sustainability Leaders Team will work together to enhance “Contemporary Art in an Age of Global Warming,” a course that explores the potential and efficacy of art to engage meaningfully with substantive, real-world problems. The Leaders Team will develop lab and fieldwork units to complement and augment understanding of the scientific dimensions of specific environmental art interventions made in the last thirty or so years. Our goal will be to expand and enrich the course in ways that challenge students and the community to think about how the creative arts might work in tandem with creative scientific thought to increase environmental sustainability.

Lynn Vollbrecht: Getting Over Posters
As a campus, we seem to be growing increasingly addicted—to paper. In researching the various ways that departments, groups, clubs, and offices get the word out about their events, staff in the college's Communications & Marketing Office have reached the conclusion that there’s a huge reliance on paper posters. A lot of posters means a lot of wasted paper, incurring a lot of expense. Students on this team will tackle the issue this summer, employing research, implementation, and plans for educating campus about any potential reforms and policy recommendations regarding the use of paper/posters in marketing campus events.

Professor Dan Bartlett, Linda Sturtz, Christy Clancy: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Teaching and Learning about Extinction
The centennial of the extinction of the passenger pigeon is September 1, 2014. To commemorate this event, an interdisciplinary team of faculty, staff and students from the fields of history, writing, science, and museum studies will develop and implement interpretive programs and resources for exploring the history of the passenger pigeon locally and examining how the bird’s extinction informs contemporary sustainability issues.

Professor Daniel Youd, Pablo Toral: Rivers in Transition
Over the course of the 2014-15 academic year, this leadership team will create a learning community of students, faculty, and staff who will meet biweekly to develop an interdisciplinary approach to the study of water security with a dual focus on the Yellow River basin in China and the Mississippi River basin in the United States. 

Lindsay Chapman: Planning for Earth Week
Every year, Earth Day is a time of reflection on our interaction with our environment and community. Without planning and programming, this day is often an afterthought. This team will plan an integrated week (or more) of events that generate intentional awareness about our relationship to our environment and our community. ","Successful faculty applicants for Beloit College Sustainability Citizen Course and Sustainability Leaders Team projects will receive various levels of support, as follows:

Within these priorities is $5 million for faculty chairs, both intended to foster the mission of women’s leadership and preparing students to succeed in an interconnected world through community engagement and sustainable practices. 

For the 2012-13 academic year, 5.6% of the institution’s operating budget ($703,000 of $12,438,000) was allocated to supporting institutional engagement with the community. These allocations were derived from tuition and endowment revenues and are permanent to the extent that they are mission and strategic initiatives of the institution. Funds allocated to faculty for course and program development include Global Focus ($25,000) to partner with the annual community partner specific to the selected region of study, as well as for funding internal incentive grants for faculty such as Mim Seidel’s urban garden project with Larimer Green Team ($35,000), and faculty fellow awards for work with a variety of community partners ($20,000). 

Faculty and staff are regularly funded to attend events and conferences related to community engagement activities. Engagement activities are supported through faculty sabbaticals and research funding. For example, an internal grant of $2000 was provided to Ms. Miriam Seidel to conduct a feasibility study for engagement of identified community participants in a community garden project. In partnership with the Larimer Green Team, Ms. Seidel’s study explored whether subjects recruited for an evidence-based group diabetes program would concurrently participate in a community garden when given the opportunity and encouragement to do so. As a result of this grant, a similar project was conducted in Pittsburgh's Hazelwood neighborhood in Summer 2014. Research for both projects was conducted by students in the FST (Food Studies) 613 Community Research: Food and Health course. 

The institution regularly funds international travel for developing partnerships with global institutions. A contingent of university administrators and board of trustee members traveled to EARTH University in Costa Rica to develop ongoing sustainability partnerships between the institutions. As a result, the university received funding to develop courses in conjunction with EARTH. In Summer 2015, Falk School of Sustainability faculty members Nadine Lehrer and John Taylor led a two-week, three credit Global Agriculture course to Costa Rica taught at EARTH University and on nearby farms. ","Community engagement is recognized as one form of scholarship. As the majority of Chatham’s graduate programs are applied in nature, engaged scholarship is frequently substantial in the faculty reviews for promotion and are routinely assessed and rewarded. 

The University recognizes that faculty teaching and research interests are enhanced through planned travel, whether it is to a professional meeting or to consult with research colleagues at other institutions, or another type of travel activity that leads to professional development. Consequently, the University invests in faculty’s broad involvement and activities and makes available, through the Office of Academic Affairs, reimbursement of partial expenses for these purposes for interested full-time faculty. For the 2012-13 academic year, the University supported over $87,000 in faculty travel. ",--,--

Columbia University,2016-01-13,2016-01-13 14:27:28,as3215@columbia.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"The University offers various types of incentives to develop new courses. In certain programs, instructors are paid a financial incentive to develop new courses ($5,000 for the M.S. in Sustainability Management). In other cases, faculty are encouraged to develop new courses as part of their responsibilities with the Earth Institute (as opposed to their ""home"" department). These courses are offered through Earth Institute programs and typically open to multiple education programs. In other cases, research scientists (who are on soft money not faculty lines) may develop and teach new courses, which provides base salary support for their positions, reducing the amount the must raise through grants. This also attracts scientists who might not otherwise teach.

Much of this activity is led by the Earth Institute. The Earth Institute is a centrally administered (University wide) research & education organization that represents a unique model for academia. Faculty are associated with both the Earth Institute and another school or department at the University (i.e. the School of International and Public Affairs, the Engineering School, etc.). Because of this unique model, faculty are encourage to develop courses for interdisciplinary programs. For example, Columbia launched its PhD in Sustainable Development in 2004, and its M.S. in Sustainability Management and undergraduate Sustainable Development degree programs in the fall of 2010. Enhanced teaching opportunities were created by the university with 49 new courses to date having been created for  these degrees alone. As sustainability degree offerings continue to expand, more faculty are incentivized to participate. 
","As additional degrees, certificates, and concentrations are added faculty are encouraged to design courses to fulfill the changing needs of students. With these new courses, there is additional funding for instructing courses in sustainability and for professional development. The Earth Institute expands research, and ducational activities in conjunction with Columbia University schools and departments. The Earth Institute faculty coordinates undergraduate and graduate education programs and oversees the developments of new degree programs.These programs open up opportunities for researchers who don't have faculty lines to gain teaching experiences, which aside from financial incentives, provides important professional development.

One program is a faculty workshop on sustainability that has been offered to faculty every year since 2011.  This program, taught by sustainability faculty and sustainability professionals provides faculty the opportunity to learn about sustainability and resilience and see examples of it in different disciplines and courses.  It is open to all faculty, and the faculty are provided a stipend for participating in the entire workshop.  They are also asked to edit a current syllabus they will be teaching for the next year and integrate sustainability projects, principles, etc into the course.  One of the positive outcomes is that faculty who have participated in the previous year and integrated sustainability into their course are invited back to present to the new faculty about their experiences, results and outcomes from the process.  Many faculty have quantitative and qualitative data they are able to share about their integration.  

The second program is an environmental mini-grant program that all faculty have been allowed to apply for to receive funding to integrate a sustainability-related project or activity to their existing disciplinary courses or programs.  For example, a faculty member could apply for funding to receive software for a statistics course that would track energy usage for a particular building so the students would be able to analyze the data as a class project.  The funding amounts vary per application, but the written application is reviewed by a faculty grant administrator and, if approved, the faculty member completes the projects and provides a report back to the grant administrator expounding upon how sustainability has been integrated into the course/program they were working on.

These fellowships are competitive. While the curricular area for development is open, proposals to develop sustainability courses are welcome.

The Fellowship provides reassigned time (course release) from teaching for one, two, or three courses. Additionally, faculty may be awarded a budget of up to $2,000.

Oberlin College's research fund programs, which are awarded competitively, can be used to fund sustainability research projects. The most significant faculty research funding opportunity is Research Status. Research status awards are made by the President acting on the advice of the divisional faculty councils. The faculty councils give their advice based on the evaluation of the merit of the proposals by the Research and Development Committee. Faculty members may be placed on Research Status for up to one year. They are relieved of all regular teaching duties and committee work for the term of the award. The primary criterion to be used in making Research Status appointments is the quality of the proposed scholarly work. Additional criteria include the proven ability to bring a substantial scholarly or artistic project to conclusion, the value of the proposed project to the applicant's professional development, and the feasibility of the project and the likelihood of achievement of the proposed outcome within the time available.

Faculty may also apply for student research assistants, either for summer research or for research assistance during the academic year. Awards are competitive. The projects are selected based on the quality of the faculty research proposal, but the projects should also meet the intellectual needs of the student assistants.

Three additional LIASE faculty-development workshops will be held in spring 2015, on ""Art to Survive Disasters By,"" ""Papermaking in Asia as Sustainable Practice,"" and ""Sustainable Energy and Environmental NGOs in China."" Oberlin faculty who participate in the LIASE faculty-development workshops will be eligible to apply for summer 2015 curriculum-development grants to incorporate new content on Asia and the environment in their courses.

In addition, the first LIASE study tour – ""Environment and Environmental NGOs in China"" – will take place during Winter Term 2015, led by Associate Professor of Chinese Qiusha Ma, Professor of Geology and Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences Steven Wojtal, Associate Professor of History and East Asian Studies David Kelly, and Professor of Geology Dennis Hubbard. The six students joining the trip include two first-year and four second-year students.  Four are likely EAS majors, one is a likely ENVS major, and one intends to double major in EAS and ENVS. Through meetings with NGOs and environmental scholars, site visits, and cultural activities in Beijing, Chengdu, and Taigu, the study tour will enable students and faculty to explore firsthand the connections between Asian studies and environmental studies.

Sustainability 101 :
As the world’s population grows and consumption rises, human and natural systems are becoming increasingly stressed, some on the verge of collapse. Solving this crisis requires a change in perception. No longer can sustainability be viewed as an add-on, rather it must become an integral consideration in every discipline and within our daily lives.

A multi-disciplinary task-force, including faculty members from Parks College of Aviation and Engineering, the School of Social Work, and John Cook School of Business, worked together to develop the unique, inter-disciplinary curriculum offered through the Center. 

In 2012 the Center expanded its program offerings when it became the new home for SLU's Urban Planning and Real Estate Development (now just Urban Planning and Development) masters program and the University's graduate certificate program in Advanced Remote Sensing and Geographic Systems.

Beginning in 2013 the Center partnered with the Business School and the Law School to develop two new dual degree programs: (1) Master of Business Administration & Master of Science in Sustainability and (2) Juris Doctor and Master of Arts in Urban Planning and Development. Both programs went online in the Fall of 2014. The Center is currently working with the business school on plans for a dual degree in Sustainability and Supply Chain Management.

Expansion and enhancement of the Center's academic offerings have provided unique opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration across the University. Center have faculty and staff have worked closely with colleagues in other schools to develop unique curricula that serve the various dual degree programs.","The core, interdisciplinary task force that developed the Center's initial curriculum received significant financial bonuses, outside of typical university pay grades, as an incentive to work outside of their primary schools to help launch the new degree program. The Center continues to offer competitive financial contracts to faculty members across the University who are interested and able to develop and teach courses for the Center.

Center faculty members also collaborate with faculty members in other departments and at other University's on research and interdisciplinary grant proposals.To solve complex sustainability problems, requires teams of experts both within the university, across disciplines, and outside of the university across sectors. For example, the collaborative research that Dr. Damon Hall is involved with integrates biophysical research with social science for the purposes of applying knowledge to decision making that fosters transitions towards sustainability. These efforts have united faculty from biology, earth and atmospheric sciences, sustainability, sociology, communication, ecology, geography, natural resources, forestry, anthropology, and information sciences departments around the country for the purpose of addressing society's most pressing problems. These problems include managing urban streams, urban sustainability design, crowd sourced hydrologic models for predictive decision making, floodplain management, drought impacts on water quality and its mitigation, and public-private partnerships for urban pollinator conservation throughout North America. The aim is collaborative contribution to methods that help shape transformational sustainability science.

Stanford University,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 01:14:07,mbhafer@stanford.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"Stanford provides incentives for developing sustainability classes through multiple departments and institutes, including the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, Precourt Institute for Energy, and School of Earth Sciences. Affiliation with these organizations offers faculty who teach sustainability courses numerous professional development and other incentives.

The Stanford Woods Institute was founded in 2004 as part of The Stanford Challenge, a university-wide initiative to address the world’s most pressing problems of the modern era, including the Initiative on the Environment and Sustainability.  The Woods Institute supports environmental research, teaching, and learning at all levels of the university.

The Precourt Institute for Energy (PIE) serves as a hub for a number of centers, programs, and projects related to interdisciplinary energy research and learning at Stanford.  PIE provides funding and associated support for cutting-edge energy research, creates and maintains avenues for effective communication and intellectual exchange among scholars and others seeking energy solutions, and develops energy-literate leaders and communities through educational programs and the dissemination of research results.

Stanford’s School of Earth Sciences houses two of the university’s largest interdisciplinary sustainability programs: the Earth Systems program and the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.  Both of these programs seek to educate the next generation of environmental leaders and scholars.
","The Stanford Woods Institute and PIE have the ability to appoint their own faculty fellows. Faculty who accept affiliation with one of these programs have access to a range of resources and incentives for creating sustainability courses, including complimentary TAs for sustainability courses and professional development. PIE administers the ongoing Energy Seminar, a weekly lecture series in which professors and researchers are invited to speak about sustainability issues. Through the weekly Environmental Forum series, the Woods Institute holds  academic interdisciplinary talks for Woods Faculty and Woods Affiliated Faculty throughout the academic year on a weekly basis.

The Woods Institute recently standardized the teaching of sustainability courses by creating its own course catalog designation, ENVRINST.  Now, sustainability courses at Stanford need not be confined by the designation of a particular department, but instead can be taught under the Woods Institute designation.  This enables and incentivizes non-traditional faculty, such as staff and Institute Fellows, to teach sustainability courses.

Throughout 2010 and 2011, the university launched the Study of Undergraduate Education at Stanford, which sought to re-evaluate how the undergraduate curriculum and requirements are determined.  The full text of the report, which addresses sustainability courses, can be found online: http://www.stanford.edu/dept/undergrad/sues/SUES_Report.pdf. 

Over the past three years, Stanford has created university-wide momentum for teaching more sustainability courses.  As stated in President Hennessy's 2011 Annual Report, ""the Stanford Challenge also provided essential facilities to support groundbreaking research and teaching.  By the campaign’s conclusion, 26 new buildings — including 10 that support multidisciplinary research and teaching — had been constructed. Many replaced buildings that were more than 50 years old and completely unable to support modern research or teaching."" An opportunity to teach in a world-class facility has incentivized faculty members to develop sustainability and other multidisciplinary courses.

Finally, faculty members who develop and teach classes above and beyond the typical schedule are financially compensated for their additional effort. Therefore, there is a financial incentive to develop and offer new courses at Stanford, and some faculty have developed sustainability courses in order to take advantage of this incentive. For example, two new Thinking Matters courses, ""Sustainability and Collapse,"" and ""A Transition Towards Sustainability"" qualified for this financial incentive.

The ultimate goal of the TELI program is to increase the exposure and knowledge of all Tufts students to enable them to effectively engage with the issues that will shape their generation. Emphasis is placed on recruiting faculty participants from a wide range of disciplines. Past workshops have included interactive presentations by a variety of experts in the field of environmental science and policy, field-based learning experiences, access to a range of resources for course development, and opportunities to share creative teaching experiences with other faculty.

TELI is advertised to all of Tufts' campuses and is open to any Tufts faculty or teaching graduate student. The intention is to make teachers more familiar with environmental issues and to give them the tools to integrate them into their curriculum - irrespective of which department or school they teach in. The participants apply through a registration form, and to date we have never turned anyone away. 

The Tufts Institute of the Environment (TIE) funds the faculty facilitators' stipends, participant stipends, and other course needs. TIE also provides logistical support of the program: TIE staff organize the rooms, the food, coordinate the people who oversee each day, etc.

TIE specifically allocates $10,000 - $15,000 towards the development of new content and curriculum for courses related to sustainability.

The WSSS program, Water: Systems, Science and Society, an interdisciplinary certificate program for graduate students, is given money every year to further develop their program and courses.

The university provides funds and resources for the development of new sustainability courses and programs. For example, over the last 5 years:

A masters program in conservation medicine was created with $100,000.
An engineering course in water resource management was created with $8,000.
A course on climate change and health remote sensing was created with $15,000.

This Seminar will draw graduate and upper-level undergraduate students together to develop interdisciplinary perspectives on one of three pressing global health issues: the emergence of infectious disease, the pursuit of sustainable agriculture, and the loss of biodiversity.  Faculty from all three campuses will provide expertise and guidance for individual and group teaching and learning. Students will examine and represent their discipline's  perspective and tools to other group members; learn and incorporate other disciplines into their own thinking; and collaborate with others on the development of new, synthesized solutions. The course will prepare students and faculty to address complex global health challenges from an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach and set a framework for similar cross-school collaborative learning and teaching experiences at Tufts. Topic for 2011 Seminar: Anticipating disease outbreaks in a globalized world.

With the human population expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050, how will we meet the increasing demand for food in an ecologically sustainable way? Historically, rapid increases in yield have been a result of advances in three main technologies: (1) genetic improvement; (2) use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers; and (3) expanded irrigation. Each of these technological advances, however, has limitations or has led to significant environmental degradation. There is an urgent need for new approaches to food production without destroying the environment. In this interdisciplinary course, we will examine the pros and cons of divergent approaches to meeting this food demand.  Using crops grown in developing and industrialized countries as case studies, we will evaluate: (1) how ecological knowledge makes food production more sustainable; (2) what existing and emerging approaches can, in the face of climate change, contribute to a reliable supply of nutritious food; and (3) the political and economic drivers that shape who has access to these technologies. We will also explore stakeholder-specific perspectives (growers, advocacy groups, industry, governmental agencies), as well as develop important communication skills for negotiating these different perspectives.

UC Davis Dining Services Go Green Grants provide funds for individuals or teams of University of California, Davis (UC Davis) students, staff, and faculty to research, develop, implement, and design solutions to campus sustainability challenges. Grants are awarded for projects fostering a more sustainable campus.

Funding examples:

Education for Sustainable Living Program
Education for Sustainable Living program (ESLP) is a collaborative interdisciplinary effort to realize a sustainable community throughout the University of California. This student-facilitated course is structured as a two-unit seminar series – hosting guest lectures by renowned educators, authors, environmentalists, and progressive thinkers. Lectures are open to the public free of charge to encourage collaboration between campus and local community members. The course encourages reflection upon and analysis of the principles of sustainability, and is designed to encourage dialogue between students, faculty, staff, administration, local community and the University of California community.

The Field Guide to Sustainable Living
The field guide to sustainable living in Davis project is a unique course offered twice a year where students will not only learn the mechanics of sustainable behaviors in Davis (and the major concepts behind sustainable living), but also learn how to engage those around them in these same behaviors. The course is a hands on field-trip based course intended to introduce student to issues in sustainability and connect them to sustainability-related resources on campus. The course is planned and facilitated by students with experience in sustainable living on and around campus to provide a unique, non-stressful atmosphere which can be conducive to self-initiated learning.

Biological Orchard & Garden
In the campus-wide effort to move towards a landscaping genre that embraces lawn reduction and increases native garden atmosphere more suitable to the teaching, outreach and research missions of the University of California, Davis, and also creates garden places more suitable to the region, the Biological Orchard and Garden project is poised to join the effort and add three Mediterranean-themed garden plots to an existing orchard.

Relevance: The ESLP and Field Guide classes are both sustainability-centered academic classes directly funded by the Go Green Grant. Funding goes to honoraria for speakers, stipend for class organizers and seed funding for ESLP's community Action Research Teams (ART). The purpose of the Biological Orchard Garden is to enable a space for research on drought resistant and Mediterranean orchards to be used for independent studies in conjunction with the College of Biological Sciences Biology 2B course.

The goal of the New Leaf Grant Program is to catalyze the infusion of sustainability in courses across disciplines at UCSB. Those applying may consider integrating sustainability by asking students to:
• Identify one or more serious environmental problems and examine its underlying causes and possible consequences.
• Explore the conceptual foundations of our environmental attitudes, values, and challenges from a variety of cultural perspectives.
• Examine humanity’s role as the planet’s ecologically dominant species and how that affects the continuing viability of habitats for life on Earth.
• Demonstrate the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and social systems.
• Investigate how our relationship to the natural world has been shaped historically, politically, and/or economically.
• Examine the controversies surrounding questions of values and ethics as they relate to creating a sustainable future.
• Utilize tools to communicate effectively about sustainability issues


Successful proposals seeking to infuse sustainability into undergraduate courses will encompass one or more of the following:
•Service learning experiences that make use of the university or local community as a “living laboratory”:  There are ample demonstration sites (solar panels, bioswales-biological filtration for stormwater, organic gardens, and farms, etc) which could be used as teaching tools in academic courses. With each of these locations, there are opportunities to use campus staff and community members as guest lecturers or mentors for student projects. 
•Opportunities for the broader campus or community to learn from student research/projects:  Class assignments/projects that are structured such that they can be shared with a larger audience, by students, or instructors (or both).
•Community building: Provides an opportunity for community outreach or community building around environmental issues.
•Demonstrated Learning Outcomes: Student learning of sustainability is measured/demonstrated. 
•Interdisciplinary: Collaborative projects which involve faculty and/or students from different disciplines to explore cross-cutting themes, such as environmental justice, human food systems, and scarcity of natural resources (water, air, soil, etc.).

Faculty can also apply for a grant to develop sustainability “modules” that can be used by a wide range of instructors within their department or campus-wide.  These modules should be in a format that is easy for instructors to use (such as video, with chapters, study questions, and project ideas) and should relate to “core topics/questions” related to sustainability).  

There is an interactive workshop hosted by Instructional Development for those interested in infusing sustainability into their courses. 

Examples of positive outcomes:
- (2012-13): To incorporate sustainability awareness into Religious Studies 185, ""Food, Religion, & Culture in the Middle East."" Revisions include developing the following topics: the Neolithic Revolution and its impact on the environment; environmental impacts of irrigation systems; sustainability and Bedouin culinary culture; the Medieval Arab ""Green Revolution"" and its environmental impacts; agricultural sustainability; politics of food sovereignty; ecological factors and their impacts on the Arab uprisings of 2012-13.
- (2012-13): To incorporate sustainability awareness into Sociology 134EC, ""Earth in Crisis."" Revisions include making a digitalized film of approximately 45 minutes that documents in a compelling fashion the climate crisis faced by human society, and focuses on a global social movement composed importantly of youth from around the world, devoted to working on the issue in a variety of ways, including movement organizing, dissemination of information, and direct pressure on the national delegations seeking to negotiate a climate treaty by the time of the 2015 meetings of the U.N.

The initiative is designed to encourage the sharing of courses among the four UM campuses to increase options for students, provide opportunities for faculty development leaves, or even expand departmental offerings.  In the past, one of the major barriers to sharing courses has been that when students from one campus take courses from another UM campus, the home campus loses tuition fees.  Based on the work at other universities, this initiative is designed to promote course sharing and collaborative programs and overcome that barrier.","Grants will be awarded to develop and offer “shared courses” where courses are available to students on at least one other UM campus.  The courses could be delivered through conferencing software (e.g. Adobe Connect, WebEx), as a blended or hybrid class, a fully online class, or through other similar methods.  A total of $250,000 is available and awards will be made in the spring of 2014.  Proposals will be funded for up to $10,000* per course.  Preference will be given to proposals that tie multiple courses together that can be shared across at least two campuses – thus increasing the overall impact.To promote the cross-campus course sharing, UM Academic Affairs will provide an incentive of $300 to the host campus for each student who enrolls in the course from another UM campus.  For example, if UMKC offers a course that has capacity of 20 students and only 10 UMKC students enroll, but five enroll from other UM campuses, the UMKC campus would get an additional $1,500.  This arrangement would provide incentives for campuses to offer courses in the “cooperative” and share courses with the other campuses.

CEREO’s bottom-up approach to institutional transformation has actively involved faculty, chairs, deans and central administration in the shaping of a center unique to the culture of WSU and the expertise of its members.  As a result, CEREO has been able to identify areas where its efforts will complement rather than conflict with those of academics disciplines and existing programs.","See website for details regarding incentives in research, education, and outreach.",http://www.cereo.wsu.edu/,--

Western Michigan University,2016-02-24,2016-02-24 12:21:51,jeffrey.spoelstra@wmich.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,"WMU's Office for Sustainability conducted a survey of faculty, in January 2012, to help identify and prioritize the types of initiatives and policy changes faculty believe are important for facilitating the infusion and integration of sustainability into research and teaching. The result of this survey was the creation of the Sustainability Across Research and Teaching (StART) Initiative, a ground-up, faculty-driven effort in the form of a new University-wide learning community. The intent of the learning community was to build understanding, develop skills, and promote conditions to improve quality of life for all through sustainability teaching and research.

After a very successful series of four StART-I luncheons with faculty in 2012, the Office of the Provost, the Office of Faculty Development, and the Office for Sustainability launched StART-II in early 2013. The StART-II Initiative offered opportunities for a cross-disciplinary group of participants to study pedagogical topics of shared interest in an in-depth, ongoing, scholarly, and systematic manner. StART-II participants met once every two weeks for two hours, delved into existing research on their common area of inquiry, then reviewed examples of sustainability infusion as a working group.

The StART Initiative luncheon series built new relationships in an expanding group of faculty dedicated to the infusion of sustainability and climate change-related issues across all colleges. While we could not identify new courses or content that directly resulted from the Faculty Learning Community/StART-II effort, several new course requests referenced the StART efforts as foundational to course updates in areas from behavior, to business, and to food systems administration.

During this same time period, the Office for Sustainability established an annual university-wide Sustainability Event Series. The annual Spring event focuses on the infusion of sustainability across the curriculum. Dr. Mitchell Thomashow was the inaugural visiting scholar and keynote. He also participated in a workshop for faculty and administrators.

Finally, though it is not specifically called out as a topic or focus area, the Office of Faculty Development offers Instructional Development Project Grants, which support instructional and curricular development projects at WMU.  The maximum level of award is $5,000 each, with up to approximately $50,000 awarded annually. Group, department, and interdisciplinary projects are given priority.   ","The StART-II community had faculty co-facilitators, knowledgeable in the field of sustainability, and a small operating budget to invest in materials and resources to promote the actions of the community. StART-II participants furthered their individual professional skills, and actively promoted curricular development in the area of sustainability across the curriculum and within their colleges. Participants reviewed foundational policy, university and departmental strategic plans, and other initiatives in sustainability outside of academics and research at WMU.  Incentives ($1,000) were offered by Academic Affairs for faculty who submitted revised sustainability courses before October 13, 2013.

The Sustainability Event Series and Instructional Development Grants provide community and financial support for faculty interested in sustainability infusion.",http://www.wmich.edu/sustainability/research/resources/start-ii-flc,--

Under the auspices of the Faculty Sustainability Academy, Steering Committee, faculty members from the Huxley College of the Environment, College of Business and Economics, College of Science and Technology, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Fairhaven College, and Woodring College of Education, collaborated in the winter 2009 through fall 2010 to design a series of three sustainability literacy courses. With a professor from Huxley serving as course coordinator, 12-16 different faculty members from the various departments and prepared lectures as a series of guest instructors. The classes are intended to serve as “feeder” courses to the majors found in each of the colleges.

The faculty received financial and staff support from the sustainability institute initiative to fund this program.
