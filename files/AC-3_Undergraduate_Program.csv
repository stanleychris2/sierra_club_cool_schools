Albion College,2016-02-25,2016-02-25 15:18:50,mfrever@albion.edu,2.0,Pursuing,True,Sustainability Studies BA,"The major in sustainability studies at Albion College is a joint venture between Albion College and the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (UVSQ), in France. UVSQ is located less than a half hour from Paris and is among the top research universities in the world. This collaboration offers an opportunity for Albion students to participate in an international, interdisciplinary program that is grounded in the social sciences and designed for students who are engaged in today's and tomorrow's sustainability challenges.

Courses in the curriculum are categorized as theories, tools, and terrains. Theories include the framing concepts and scientific principles of sustainability studies, while tools are the methods of analysis and communication. Terrains are specific fields of sustainability challenges, using the theories and tools that students will have already mastered.

Through this integration students are invited to explore, on the one hand, the relationships between the economy, lifestyle, and politics and, on the other hand, the physical environment, natural resource use, pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss. In this way, the interdisciplinary and international character of the major in sustainability studies complements the disciplinary foundations of traditional degree programs.

The major in sustainability studies is obtained by following a four-year program of study offered on a collaborative basis through the UVSQ/Albion partnership. During the first, second, and fourth years of study, courses are offered through UVSQ and Albion College, on the Albion campus, while the third year includes a semester of study abroad at UVSQ.

During the semester abroad, students in the program will complete upper-level courses in both theory and tools categories, as well as preparing research papers in selected terrains (case studies and specialized topics). They will be introduced to European culture and the European ethos of sustainability, and visiting international collaborations.

After successfully completing the major in sustainability studies, and upon graduation from Albion College, students will receive the B.A. in sustainability studies from Albion College along with a certificate of sustainability studies from UVSQ. They will also be eligible to enter the second year master's program at UVSQ (taught in English) in sustainability studies.",http://www.albion.edu/academics/programs-of-distinction/center-for-sustainability-and-the-environment/majors-and-concentrations/sustainability-studies-major,Environmental Studies BA,"Students completing the environmental studies major will gain a deep understanding of the complex relationships among natural and social systems, as well as a proficiency in the analytical, rhetorical and creative skills necessary to perceive the wonders of the natural and human worlds and to solve the environmental challenges we face in the twenty-first century.

",True,Minor in Environmental Science ,"The primary mission of the environmental sciences minor is to prepare students in the Mellon College of Science for careers or postgraduate education in the diverse fields of environmental science. We feel strongly that these endeavors must be grounded in strong fundamental science; consequently, the program extends majors in the Mellon College of Science. We also award minors to students from other colleges, provided that they can build a course of study with sufficient scientific rigor to meet the standards of the program.

As a capstone program, the minor is built around advanced courses that extend as well as broaden the specialized education associated with the major programs. Environmental sciences are highly interdisciplinary in nature, and while it is necessary that students have an exposure to introductory courses in several of these disciplines, it is by no means sufficient; in-depth knowledge is required. We encourage all students to
pursue generally broad studies, including subjects that encompass human interactions with the environment, and will provide guidance to all students interested in the area. We encourage those students who intend to devote focused attention to environmental sciences to pursue this minor.

Environmental Sciences are broadly defined as pursuits designed to develop fundamental understanding of the natural environment and human interactions with the environment. Research problems are frequently motivated by perceived problems (air, water and soil pollution, reduction in biodiversity, global climate change, etc...), but inevitably extend to the fundamental mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Research can be highly specialized (focusing for example on the biochemistry of a
particular enzyme or the synthesis of a particular catalyst) or highly general (focusing for example on the complex, nonlinear interactions of populations on complex ecosystems). Our program is designed to ensure that students of the field are conversant with questions on all of these scales, from the microscopic to the global.",http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/previous/1213_catalog.pdf,Minor in Environmental Studies ,"Human activities can have large-scale and long-term consequences for environmental quality.

The goal of the major is to equip students with the knowledge, intellectual tools and learning experiences necessary to understand the causes and consequences of our environmental challenges. The Program seeks to develop in students the creative problem solving skills necessary to design and develop a more sustainable relationship between humans and the rest of the natural world. Core courses in the program build a foundation in natural and social sciences and the humanities; these provide the lateral rigor necessary to understand and analyze issues from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Students then select from a broad range of intermediate and advanced courses to develop a focused course of study or “curricular pathway”. Many ES majors augment their experience at Oberlin by participating in study away programs and summer internships. The ES major at Oberlin prepares students for graduate work and careers in a broad range of professional and academic fields. The Adam Joseph Lewis Center, which houses Oberlin’s ES Program, is an internationally recognized facility that is designed to showcase environmentally responsible architecture, and to serve as an integrated component of the curriculum.  

Those interested in the major are encouraged to begin the social science component of the major with Environment and Society (ENVS 101) during their freshman year and to complete Nature, Culture and Interpretation (ENVS 201 or 202) and core introductory science requirements during their first two years.

We live in times in which our urban and built environments are undergoing unprecedented change. The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Environmental Design degree provides students with the skills to understand, analyze, and solve problems associated with such change, with a view toward community vitality, social fairness, and the design of sustainable environments. Environmental design, offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, applies knowledge of social and behavioral science to plan and design community environments that affect, and are affected by, human behavior.

While concerned about humanity's use, misuse, and abuse of the natural environment, environmental design is also concerned with the planned environment which humans build - the ""artificial"" or designed physical environment - and its ability to meet community needs. More subtly, environmental design includes issues from our cultural, economic, physical, political, and social environments. 

Environmental design practitioners develop long- and short-term plans and designs to use land for the growth and revitalization of urban, suburban, and rural communities, while helping local officials make decisions concerning social, cultural, economic, physical, and environmental issues.

The Global Sustainability minor is listed under Interdisciplinary Studies and receives academic oversight from the Departments of Earth System Science, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, and Planning, Policy & Design. The minor is open to all UC Irvine students. 

The interdisciplinary minor in Global Sustainability prepares students to consider the challenges of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, with emphasis upon addressing the extreme poverty that afflicts at least 20 percent of the world’s current population. The Earth is a complex system comprised of interactions between its various physical, biological, social, and political components, and human populations have initiated many global trends that cannot be sustained indefinitely. Some of these trends are physiochemical or biological in nature (the depletion of fossil fuels, the accumulation of ozone-depleting chemicals, the destruction of wildlife habitat, and high rates of species extinction), while others are social and political (accelerating urbanization, population displacement, and regional economic imbalance). As a result, the vitality of the Earth depends on interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches that draw on the strengths of multiple fields. 

In this program, students will become aware of the main drivers of climate change, both natural and human-induced, the intrinsic as well as the resource values of species, ecosystems, and communities, and how the loss of cultural diversity and a growing income gap between nations leads to additional pressure for biological resource exploitation. Students will become familiar with foundational sustainability concepts in social practice, governance and allocation, the physical sciences, and the biological sciences to better understand and effectively deal with contemporary environmental and social equity crises.

There can be little doubt that in the twenty-first century the global human community is facing a substantial growth in the environmental consequences of providing food, energy, materials, and basic services to a population of more than six billion inhabitants. The Environmental Systems Program recognizes the growing demand for environmental specialists and is designed to prepare undergraduates to enter a broad spectrum of environmental careers and graduate programs in, for example, the natural sciences, the social sciences, public policy, law, and business.

This interdisciplinary program recognizes that local, national, regional, international, and global environmental problems do not fit neatly into traditional academic departments. A measurable part of society’s inability to effectively manage complex environmental problems stems from the lack of specialists who can apply analytical tools that cross disciplinary boundaries. Many environmental specialists possess little training in the natural sciences including both the fundamental ideas and methodologies of the earth and environmental sciences. The environmental systems major was created to address both of these shortcomings.

Upon completion of the bachelor’s degree, graduates of the Environmental Studies program at Warren Wilson College are prepared for both advanced studies and various environmental related jobs.

The Department of Environmental Studies at Warren Wilson College was established in the late 1970’s by members of the Biology Department, who began leading the campus community in conservation efforts and offering new courses related to energy and conservation. With the understanding that the solutions to modern environmental problems require the collaboration of many disciplines, the department has grown to include faculty members from across Warren Wilson’s academic community. This collaboration provides students with an environmentally focused, interdisciplinary major that investigates environmental issues from a natural science, social science, and humanities perspective.

The mission of the Environmental Studies Department, an interdisciplinary learning community, is to prepare leaders who are able to critically assess, develop, and promote sustainable futures for life on Earth.

The Environmental Studies major, through academic courses, abundant natural resources on and near campus, and related work crews, balances theory, first-hand knowledge, and field experiences. Internships are also strongly encouraged as a way to acquire experience and to apply academically acquired knowledge. This program aims to graduate students with a strong foundation in the natural sciences and an understanding of the social, political and ethical implications of environmental problems and solutions.
