General education at Appalachian is anchored in the ideals and practices of liberal education and aims to prepare students to fulfill the responsibilities and meet the challenges presented by a changing world.

The goals and outcomes of the Gen Ed program ""promote broad based, interdisciplinary knowledge, higher level transferable skills, the connection between local and global issues and environments, and a sense of personal and social responsibility as applied to problems.""

Every degree seeking student has to take a minimum of 6 hours in ""Local to Global.""  The rationale of this perspective is:
""Appalachian State University is both in and of the southern Appalachian region, and it is also part of a world that is globally connected.  Life in the twenty-first century requires an understanding of the connections and multi-layered interactions among diverse local and global human cultures, as well as between humans and the natural and physical environments.  In this context, the general education program helps to cultivate an active understanding of global change and the effect of human agency on both natural and cultural environments.  Students should understand the importance of biodiversity, ecological integrity, and the need to achieve sustainable benefits for communities.  Knowledge of other cultures, diverse cultural frames of reference, and alternative perspectives are essential to thinking critically and creatively and to understanding the responsibilities of membership in local, regional, and global communities.  The cultivation and maintenance of intercultural relationships require active cultural understanding, which is achieved by exploring multiple strategies for interacting with other peoples and cultures.""

The spirit of the UCC emerges from the kinds of intellectual attitudes the University strives to develop in students. The central purpose of the UCC is to enable students to live rich, satisfying lives and to undertake the broad responsibilities of citizenship in a free society. 
In addition to the UCC classes, all students must complete WISER+ courses, which ask students to engage in issues related to: 
    W	   Writing 
    I	   International Awareness
    S	   Service and Civic Engagement
    E	   Environmental Awareness and Sustainability
    R	   Respect for Human Liberty and Diversity among Peoples and Cultures

    T	   Technological Literacy
Courses with WISER+ designations may also be used to satisfy UCC and/or major requirements. 
The purpose of WISER+ is to integrate 21st Century skills into all our curricula.

WISER offers ‘E’ for sustainability. The WISER web site lists the criteria and related outcomes needed to qualify as a sustainability ‘E’ course.
"," UCC-21: WISER Guidelines 
Tier 2 courses must carry at least one WISER designation. Any other university courses, with the exception of those in the foundation, may be approved as WISER courses. All WISER courses must have category-specific learning objectives and associated assessments.

 For a course to be given an ‘E’ designation, course descriptions must: 
1. Clearly show how environmental awareness or environmental sustainability will be a substantial unit or a continuous thread of the course. 
2. Clearly state how environmental awareness or environmental sustainability achieves some of the learning objectives of the course. 

Examples of Possible Learning Objectives for Environmental Awareness and Environmental Sustainability 
Below is a list of possible learning objectives for an ‘E’ course. This is not an exhaustive list, nor must a course include all—or even most—of the topics below to carry an ‘E’ designation. Any of the topics below could be developed into a substantial part of an ‘E’ course. 
Students can: 
1. Explain fundamental environmental concepts using appropriate vocabulary. 
2. Articulate and apply the scientific method and its role in scientific inquiry concerning the environment. 
3. Explain the co-evolution of humans with their environment and the limitations of human interactions with it. 
4. Analyze environmental problems in a structured way and develop strategies for solutions that indicate how scientific principles interact with ethical, political and/or economic principles. 
5. Describe the state of the environment in relation to the social structure and human health. 
6. Analyze the complexities of phenomena that link economics, politics, culture, history, biology, geology, and physical processes. 
7. Engage in dynamic, vigorous exchange across the traditional disciplinary boundaries within and between natural and social/human sciences. 
8. Work with specific communities to facilitate self-conscious, reflective engagement with linked socio-environmental processes.

Appalachian Studies 
Learning Goals for Appalachian Studies 
Affirming the College’s four pairs of learning goals outlined in Being and Becoming, course work in Appalachian Studies at Berea College provides scaffolding for understanding cultures in Appalachia as well as insight about the relationship of Appalachia to the rest of the United States and other global regional cultures. A multidisciplinary endeavor, Appalachian Studies (APS) courses examine various aspects of Appalachian heritage and culture, including a choice of course work concerned with creative expression, health issues, sustainability, natural history, contemporary issues, gender, race, and other approved courses relating to Appalachia. Appalachian Studies courses as well as the minor complement and enrich any major program at the College (an independent major in Appalachian Studies is also available for interested students). 
APS majors and minors, as well as those students who take several APS courses, should, through classroom learning, service-learning, internships, independent learning, and other experiences: 
1. Think deeply and broadly. This includes thinking critically, analytically, and creatively about Appalachia; 
2. Strive for a big-picture understanding. Integrate diverse knowledge about Appalachia, including digital, biological, sociological, cultural, and historical sources as well as archival and field-based material to achieve a holistic understanding of Appalachia and its people and systems; 
3. Compare Appalachia across time and place. Articulate and appreciate the ways in which the Appalachian region has been and is connected to national and international development and history and how regions influence one another; 
4. Seek out interdisciplinary. Acquire a range of knowledge about Appalachia, including Appalachian prehistory, history, settlement, and industrialization; ethnic and racial diversity; natural history; the use of resources and the effects on natural and human ecologies; economic development; cultures (including religion, folkways, literature, musical, and artistic expressions); exploitation and stewardship; and the creation and manipulation of images and stereotypes; 
5. Apply. Put knowledge and practical skills to work proactively with Appalachian households and communities to build on strengths and to meet challenges in order to contribute to sustainable, just, and peaceable communities. 

APS students will thus have knowledge of Appalachia’s history and development; will work toward a comprehensive sense of the Appalachian region from a variety of cultural, social, and artistic perspectives; will gain skills and passion to work with communities in the mountains; and will be able to see Appalachia as a model for regional study in other parts of the nation and the world.

While the first goal is important, the second is fundamental.

In focusing on the students’ development as whole or “educated” people, a university distinguishes itself from a trade school. The goal of a university education is not simply the acquisition and application of knowledge, but the creation of people who firmly grasp the worth of clear thinking and know how to do it; who understand and appreciate the differences between peoples and cultures as well as their similarities; who have a sense of history and social forces; who can express thought clearly and have quantitative ability; who know something about the arts as well as how to enjoy them; who can talk and think intelligently about the physical and life sciences, the humanities, and literature; and, above all, who have the desire and capability for learning. This goal is why a university degree is so highly valued by individuals, employers, and the community at large.

The Sacramento State General Education Program is designed to educate in this holistic sense. Thus, it is not simply a series of courses to complete or hoops for students to jump through as they complete the courses in their major. Rather, general education lies at the heart of what a university education is all about.

Therefore students should carefully select courses and actively seek subject areas that are new and may challenge their world views or cherished assumptions and offer new experiences, such as inquiry-based or community-based learning. In short, students should not take the easy way out. This is their opportunity to lay the foundation for the rest of their lives, and to define themselves as educated members of the human community. Their time at the university is precious and the General Education Program has been designed to help them begin the process of becoming truly educated people. In deciding to pursue a university degree, they have chosen well and should make the best use of the opportunities open to them.

Objectives

Upon completion of the General Education Program requirements, students will be expected to:

• read, write, and understand relatively complex and sophisticated English prose;
• construct a non-fallacious verbal argument, recognize fallacious arguments, and follow the verbal arguments of others;
• find and use common information resources, engage in specialized library research, use computers, and seek out appropriate expert opinion and advice; and
• use mathematical ideas to accomplish a variety of tasks.

In addition to these basic skills, courses in the sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences have been selected to provide students with:

• an understanding of the workings of the physical universe, which will refine their science-based conceptual problem solving skills and develop a first-hand acquaintance with the methods of science, including a general understanding of hypothesis formation and theory-testing;
• knowledge of current theories about the origins and varieties of life on this planet, focusing on the basic principles of life processes, the interdependence of creatures in ecological systems, and the effects of changes in the environment;
• an exposure to the historical and cultural influences that have played significant roles in the evolution of the values, beliefs, and ideas of Western and non-Western societies, through the study of significant literary, philosophical, and artistic works;
• a familiarity with the theories and methods of the social sciences in order to enhance their understandings of the major institutions in our society, and the roles that both individuals and groups play in shaping experience;
• perspectives on people from various cultures and backgrounds, including awareness of the contributions of non-Western cultures, women, and ethnic groups to the rich diversity of human activity; and
• an understanding of the current theories and methods used to expand our knowledge of the processes of mental and physical development throughout the human life cycle.",http://catalog.csus.edu/12-14/first%20100%20pages/ge.html,"Our rationale for choosing degree programs with sustainable learning outcomes was strongly influenced by the technical manual's definition of sustainable learning outcomes as follows ""Sustainability learning outcomes are statements that outline the specific sustainability knowledge and skills that a student is expected to have gained and demonstrated by the successful completion of a unit, course, or program. Learning outcomes do not necessarily have to use the term “sustainability” to count as long as they collectively address sustainability as an integrated concept having social, economic, and environmental dimensions. For example, an institution may have adopted a set of sustainability learning outcomes for its general education program that cover systems thinking, interdisciplinary capacities, social responsibility, and an understanding of the carrying capacity of ecosystems. Each outcome does not have to include the term “sustainability” for the set to be considered sustainability learning outcomes. Likewise, however, none of those outcomes would be considered a sustainability learning outcome on their own."""

Stewardship is a core virtue that is an expected learning for every student of every program at Calvin. How to best assess this learning outcome by program is a consistent challenge that programs face.

From ""An Engagement with God’s World: the Core Curriculum of Calvin College:""
(found online here: https://www.calvin.edu/admin/provost/documents/core-curriculum.pdf)

5.9 Stewardship
The world and all it contains has been entrusted by God to the care of the human race. We are to cultivate it, tend to it, learn from it, delight in it, develop its manifold potentials, and manage it in ways that benefit the entire human community and other living members of the bio-sphere. We are not to waste it, spoil it, or use it up for ourselves at the expense of others. Yet there are many forces in our culture that would prompt us to squander the time, talent, and resources that God has graciously placed at our disposal. We often treat our natural environment as if it were infinitely resilient; we sometimes spend our days as if we had all the time in the world; we discard our things as if there will always be more; we expend our energy on frivolous activities as if there will always be time for the important things later; we let our talents lie fallow as if
there will always be someone else to take up the slack. The community at Calvin College should strive to set a good example in the wise management of time, talent, energy, and resources. Students at Calvin should become aware of the irreplaceable value of the gifts God has given them and the responsibilities attached to those gifts, and thus come to see themselves as stewards, not mere users, of the creation. Where appropriate, issues of stewardship should be addressed in our classrooms; where possible, students should be invited to participate in activities on and off campus that manifest care for God’s creation--mending what is broken, cleaning what is soiled, nurturing the frail, conserving the scarce, saving the valuable. ",All.,https://www.calvin.edu/admin/provost/documents/core-curriculum.pdf,"The Calvin Core curriculum virtue of ""Stewardship"" is nearly identical to the use of the term sustainability. It is a learning outcome for all Calvin Students, but currently there is not an explicit list of college-wide learning outcomes that are routinely assessed."

Through strategic academic, government, industry, and practice partnerships, we have defined an innovative and collaborative pedagogy enabling our students to succeed in a variety of careers. The School of Architecture holds a deep appreciation of its diverse community by cultivating an intellectual climate where individuals are nurtured to act as agents of change, improving both social and environmental conditions nationally and internationally.""

The mission statement of the Department of Engineering and Public Policy includes the following language (website below),  ""The Department of Engineering and Public Policy (EPP) is a unique engineering department, whose overall objective is to enhance undergraduate engineering education with the perspectives and skills that enable the engineer to understand and work at the interface between technology and society. Society is largely responsible for setting the goals and framing the problems that engineers work on. However, technologies designed by engineers profoundly change the societies in which they operate.""  Undergraduate EPP students develop ""an understanding of ideas and analytical tools in economics, decision science, and other social sciences through several required courses and a group of ""social analysis electives.""

Throughout these required competencies, there are 42 courses with sustainability learning outcomes. To capture an accurate number for this credit, Institutional Research calculated the number of graduates in Spring 2014 who took at least one of these 42 courses during their time at CSU. 

Graduates students do not have All University Core Curriculum so we calculated the graduate student numbers by identifying sustainability learning outcomes at the college or degree level and sustainability-focused graduate programs (per AC-4, indicated on Worksheet two of the attached document), again using 2014 graduates as a data point.

In addition to sustainability learning outcomes, the School of Global Environmental Sustainability at CSU has made a formal commitment that ""Every student will have a transcriptable experience (course, seminar, field experience, internship) related to environmental studies before graduating from CSU.""  

","The following provides examples of learning outcomes which ensure that students are prepared to think critically and engage with contemporary issues around sustainability and the environment.

College of Business:
""An understanding of the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability and how to measure, report, and manage sustainability in organizations.""

College of Engineering:
""The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.""

""Demonstrate a mastery of ecological concepts and fundamental principles and techniques to manage and conserve fish and wildlife populations, and how they apply to current natural resource management issues""

Environmental Horticulture: ""Management and leadership skills necessary for a successful career in the green industry. Technical competencies in their understanding of growth and development of horticultural plants and landscapes, including development as influenced by manipulation of horticulture technologies, such as fertility and water management, and integrated pest management for all aspects of landscape horticulture. Skills to assess site issues, provide creative environmentally sound solutions and manage designed and built landscapes""

Environmental Engineering:
""The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.  A knowledge of contemporary issues.  An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.  A recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in, life-long learning.""

Agricultural and Resource Economics:
""Successful [graduating] students will demonstrate...an ability to solve real world problems beyond the pedagogical context.  Students will be able to identify a problem and its scope, evaluate resources available to address the problem, formulate alternative solutions, and select the solution(s) most consistent with a stated objective.""

Colleges may also have college-wide learning objectives or course requirements.  For example, all students in the College of Business are required to take ""global and cultural awareness"" and ""social, regulatory and ethical issues in business.""

Nicholas School of the Environment: Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sciences and Policy - The A.B. degree is designed for students interested in the interdisciplinary study of environmental issues. The major permits students to combine studies in natural sciences and engineering with courses in social sciences and humanities to develop particular focus areas or themes relevant to students’ individual interests.

Solving the world’s environmental problems requires an understanding not only of ecological systems but also of the cultural, social, economic, and political forces that act on those systems. The A. B. degree in Environmental Sciences and Policy provides students with this background.
Students who receive the A.B. degree in Environmental Sciences and Policy are well positioned for careers where the ability to think across traditional boundaries is valued. Possible careers include:
    * Environmental advising on Capitol Hill or in other local, state or federal government agencies
    * Environmental consulting
    * Research assistant
    * K-12 teaching
    * Environmental writing or publishing
    * Curriculum development
    * Education at museums or other outreach settings
    * Majors may also choose to enter a professional graduate program in law, business, public health, or public policy, in which their undergraduate major will provide the basis for specialization.

The A.B. degree stresses a firm foundation in basic natural and social sciences. The central core course, ENVIRON 101, relies on case studies to demonstrate the inherent interdisciplinary nature of environmental problems. Other requirements include a course in probability and statistics, a course in environmental policy, and an independent study, field experience or internship. The remaining required courses in the upper-level curriculum are selected in consultation with the student’s advisor to address a specific theme, area of interest or career objective. At least two courses must be selected from each of the approved lists in natural sciences/engineering and social sciences/humanities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chemistry: Majors with a concentration in Environmental Chemistry must enroll in either ENVIRON 360 Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology, which includes the chemistry of pollutants and case studies focused on human health and ecosystem protection, or CE461L Chemical Principles in Environmental Engineering, which includes study of applied environmental systems such as water treatment, soil remediation, air pollution and green engineering.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Civil & Environmental Engineering: Our goals for the CEE program are to position our graduates to: use their knowledge and understanding of engineering sciences and design to advance their professional career; think critically when solving and managing tasks; communicate effectively in multidisciplinary, professional environments; exercise professional responsibility and sensitivity in the context of the social, economic, ethical and environmental implications of their engineering work; function effectively and efficiently as an individual and as a part of a team; and pursue life-long learning to earn relevant professional credentials (for example, licensure, professional or graduate degrees).

Fuqua School of Business: excerpt from website - Connecting Disciplines – exploring how health, the environment, law and public policy are colliding with business. GLOBAL COMMITMENT - To remain true to our mission and produce global leaders of consequence, we are rethinking traditional geographic and intellectual boundaries. The world we now live in is multi-centric, globally interdependent, and dynamic. In order to play our part in addressing tomorrow’s business challenges, we are becoming the world’s first legitimately global business school, based in the economic and cultural hubs of world regions. These cities are in the countries that write their region’s rules and set its cultural tone:
• Dubai, United Arab Emirates
• London, United Kingdom
• New Delhi, India
• Shanghai/Kunshan, China
• St. Petersburg, Russia
This global expansion is supported by the interdisciplinary culture and resources of Duke University. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Global Health Institute: Opportunities within the field of global health are expanding as the world becomes more interconnected.  Recognizing that many global health problems stem from economic, social, environmental, political, and health care inequalities, Duke has designed a new paradigm in global health education and training... A required course for the certificate ""introduces major global health problems and social, behavioral, economic, biomedical and environmental determinants of health in resource limited settings. Topics include communicable diseases i.e. HIV, malaria, tuberculosis and common childhood diseases; chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mental health; and determinants of health associated with these diseases, such as poverty, gender imbalance, culture, poor environmental sanitation, malnutrition, tobacco use, and climate change. Other topics may include health promotion, reproductive health, maternal and child health, and disaster preparedness.""
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
History: *Concentration in Race & Ethnicity: At Duke, we are interested in what W. E. B. Du Bois so famously dubbed “the problem of the color line,” as well as how race and ethnicity intertwine with other collective identities such as community or nation, class or gender.  Although embodied and experienced individually, racial and ethnic identities have served to shape social interactions, set the boundaries of inclusion and exclusion, and guide allocations of resources and power... Coursework in racial formations, imperialism, social movements, and policy and political history all explore how race and ethnicity have been made in particular locales and historical moments, as well as how being racialized and ethnicized subjects has affected people’s lived experience and material circumstance. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Integrated Toxicology and Environmental Health Program (ITEHP): Research areas of ITEHP faculty are encompassed by three broad, intersecting themes:
*Human Environmental Health and Disease. This theme focuses on the impact of environmental influences on human health. Core focal areas include: (a) Cardio-pulmonary health and disease, (b) Development and children’s health, (c) Neurological health and disease, (d) Cancer and the environment, and (e) Global environmental health.
*Exposure Science. This theme focuses on the impacts of environmental exposure on human health. ITEHP faculty have expertise in detection of organic pollutants including endocrine disrupters, pharmaceuticals, hydrocarbons, and flame retardants, inorganic pollutants including trace metals and metalloids, and organic and inorganic nanomaterials.
*Environmental Toxicology. The focus of this theme is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of action for toxins and other environmental influences on human health.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
International Comparative Studies: The gateway core course examines capitalism and neo-liberal globalization and their relationships to culture, politics, economics, and other social forms and outcomes; considers the workings of transnationalism “from below”; explains and challenges linear and Western-centric thinking about progress and modernity; focuses a historical lens on a range of political discourses, institutions, and projects (nationalist, statist, colonialist, imperialist, anti-colonialist, fundamentalist, and so on) in order to understand them contextually; demonstrates how cultures and identities are dynamically constituted in interaction with historical, material, political, and situational factors; considers how different kinds of inequality and contestation inflect most social formations and dynamics. The capstone seminar uses scholarship, literature and film to revisit some of the key critical transnationalism concepts and themes introduced in the ICS gateway course.  Unifying critical transnationalism themes and topics are selected from the following: neo-liberal globalization and its consequences; inequality, power, and social justice; cultural and discursive formations; obstacles to and limits of constituting transnational or global communities in an interconnected world; interactions between identities and institutions on various scales; law, human rights, and memory projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
School of Medicine: A required course in the MD program includes the following learning objective: Outline measured differences in access, quality and use of health care services for various local, national, and global populations, and outline the role of healthcare providers in contributing to disparity; explain the clinical and social implications for the disparate populations; be knowledgeable about the social determinants of health and social influence on health outcomes, including education, socio-economic status, race, gender, and other social influences; discuss the variety of challenges entailed in achieving health care parity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
School of Nursing: A required course for the BS in Nursing includes synthesizing the core public health functions while examining contemporary issues--locally, nationally, globally-- that increase risk or promote, maintain and restore health.  Contemporary issues include health of immigrants and refugees, nursing care in disasters, person-health-environment interactions, and nursing's role in promoting social justice.

Sanford School of Public Policy: excerpt from School goals/learning outcomes-- As a liberal arts major, public policy studies teaches students to read critically, think analytically, and write concisely. Through rigorous coursework in multiple fields, including economics, statistics, political science, history and ethics; through electives in substantive areas; and through a policy oriented internship, PPS students learn how knowledge gained through research can be used to address domestic and international problems.

Mission Statement: A major in public policy studies aims to teach students how to make a difference in the complex policy issues of today. The curriculum provides students skills in political and economic analysis, knowledge about how to lead people and organizations, and a strong ethical foundation for decision-making. 

The broad intellectual goals of any major should relate in some way to the goals of a liberal arts education. The Report on Yale College Education (April 2003), produced by a committee chaired by Richard Brodhead, listed the skills a liberal arts education should deepen. The public policy major at Duke encourages students to work toward the goals outlined in visions of a liberal arts education, which are also reflected in the Philosophy of Trinity College. 

The goals of the major in public policy studies are both pedagogical and policy specific. First, we aim to create a learning environment in which students 1) draw on skills from multiple disciplines, 2) learn to write concisely and clearly, and 3) consider the ethical implications of their actions. 

Second, the topics explored in the major should lead students 1) to think in terms of global problems and international relations, 2) to analyze the policies surrounding new advances in science (i.e., genomics) and technology (i.e., intellectual property and the Internet), and 3) to engage in solving important social problems. 
In 1971, with the help of Professor Joel Fleishman, Sanford launched Duke’s public policy program in order to educate a new kind of pragmatic, ethical leader prepared to contribute in any work sector. An equally important goal was to make it possible for scholars and policymakers to interact with, and learn from, each other. 

Nearly 40 years later, our public policy program continues to grow in remarkable ways. This maturation led to Sanford becoming Duke’s tenth School in 2009. The change is attracting creative scholars to our faculty, which has grown by 50 percent in the last four years.

These scholars deepen our capacity to teach core analytical skills. They also expand our depth of expertise in environmental and energy policy, global governance and development policy, communications policy, child policy, social policy, and global health and population. Our leadership program, our visiting journalists program and numerous active research centers in areas such as philanthropy and civil society are bringing in fresh, outside perspectives. Students are benefiting from increased research opportunities and financial aid, and closer mentoring.

In 2013-2014, 70 students graduated with degrees from multiple programs with sustainability learning objectives, including 38 undergraduates, 28 masters students, and 1 PhD student.

Several programs have been added to Duke's inventory of programs with sustainability learning objectives since our last submission. These programs existed -- likely with sustainability learning objectives -- at the time of our previous submission. They include the following:

*Chemistry AB or BS with a concentration in Environmental Chemistry
*History AB with concentrations in Human Rights & Social Movements and Race & Ethnicity

Environmental Studies
Sustainability Learning Outcomes include:
•	Develop a critical understanding of environmental issues
•	Develop an understanding of systems and multi-perspective thinking
•	Examine environmental issues particularly through the lenses of justice, power, and ethics


Environmental Science
Sustainability Learning Outcomes include:
•	Ability to apply scientific thinking (i.e. the scientific method) to environmental problems, with understanding of the complexities and constraints human cultures and societies impose on solutions to those problems
•	Understanding of the complexity and inherent multidisciplinary nature of environmental issues
•	Ability to view life decisions through a ‘sustainability filter’, especially those involving transportation, food, and housing

Biology
Ecological Biology is a required course for the major and minor and includes the following learning goals:
•	Develop global awareness, including an understanding of the natural world as a context for humanity. We will focus on several sustainability issues, and how population and community ecology principles can be applied in problem solving
•	Heightened your awareness of one’s self and others as biological and ecological beings thereby engendering a sense of the responsibility that comes with that knowledge.
Biological Diversity is a second course required for the major and minor and has the following learning outcomes:
•	Be able to interpret evolutionary relationships (phylogenies)
•	Be able to identify organisms to major taxonomic groupings, especially common local organisms
•	Be able to recognize “function” from “form” for an organisms’ anatomy and physiology
•	Be able to reconstruct the evolutionary history of major adaptations and syndromes.
•	Become aware of the conservation concern for various taxa, and how we can mitigate their decline

Peace and Global Studies
Global Dynamics and World Peace is a required course for the major and includes the following in its description and outcomes:
Course Description:
What does ""peace"" mean? Is sustainable peace possible? How can we contribute to peacebuilding? This course addresses these questions by examining current global dynamics, including violence, environmental destruction, and ""globalization."" The word ""globalization,"" in turn, is used here as shorthand to refer to another set of dynamics present in the global system today, including poverty, efforts at poverty
reduction, free trade agreements, and international migration flows. How best can we understand what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. referred to as ""the interrelated structure of reality?"" Using a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary lenses (including but not limited to history, sociology, political science, philosophy, and economics), we will look at different perspectives concerning the ways these dynamics are (or are not) related and what can be done to address the complex set of problems humanity faces today.

Course Objectives:
This course is primarily designed for sophomores who are majoring in Peace & Global Studies. …The objectives of this course are the same as one of the principal sets of objectives I have for PAGS majors generally. I want PAGS majors to be clear-eyed regarding the constraints that face liberation movements and postcolonial societies and to have an analysis of the source of those constraints. PAGS majors should have reasoned understandings of what constitutes peace and of what constitutes justice, an analysis of ways of moving toward greater justice and peace, and of the kinds of problems that arise in that movement.

To acquire the breadth in educational experience that characterizes liberal education, develop intellectual discipline, discover their interests and build a foundation for specialization, students must successfully complete courses fulfilling a prescribed set of general education requirements. General education courses include: core requirements in empirical studies; human cultures; mathematical and formal reasoning; foreign language; ultimate questions; body and mind; and global awareness offerings focusing on humans and their natural environment and world cultures.","Furman maintains general education requirements for all undergraduate students in order to graduate. Two of the general education requirements fall under a sustainability learning outcome: Humans and the Natural Environment Requirement and the World Cultures Requirement. 

Through the General Education Requirments, the university requires all students to complete a set of courses designed to:
- Invigorate and stimulate intellectual curiosity
- Broadly prepare students in a diverse set of disciplines, including the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, and the fine arts
- Encourage intellectual inquiry in sufficient depth to allow one to contribute to a greater body of knowledge
- Develop expressive capabilities in writing, speaking, and the arts
- Cultivate world citizenship—an understanding of those not like oneself
- Integrate knowledge into a meaningful synthesis


The spefifics of the Humans and Natural Environment Requirement and World Cultures Requirement is as follows: 

A course addressing humans and the natural environment (NE)
Humans are affecting the dynamics of the planet; they are changing the composition of the atmosphere, the currents in the oceans, and the productivity of natural ecosystems. Because modern societies require more energy, food, and materials than ever before, we are increasingly dependent on stable, productive, and sustainable natural systems. Ironically, our societies are becoming increasingly urban and increasingly insulated from nature just as these ineluctable dependencies are becoming increasingly important. In order to foster an appreciation for these dependencies, courses will emphasize some aspect of the interactive relationships between humans and the natural environment.

A course focusing on world cultures (WC)
World cultures courses will help students achieve a heightened awareness of the diverse cultures and traditions that have formed our world, and to reflect on the relationships between their own and other cultures. Courses will focus on the traditions, beliefs, experiences, and expressions of peoples of, or originating from, Asia, Africa, Latin America, or the pre-colonial Americas.",http://www.furman.edu/academics/UES/Documents/Catalog/General_Education_Requirements_Desc.pdf,--

https://www.fivecolleges.edu/sustain/fcss_certifcate

","Division I in ESSP
Division I at Hampshire is accomplished mainly in the first year. By taking problem and issue-based courses, students begin the process of asking their own questions and building on the progress of other professionals before them.

Through their courses students might work on an electrical generating windmill at the Farm Center, assess concentrations of arsenic from historical spraying in our apple orchards, count and observe migrating birds from our aerial walkway, or assess environmental justice issues in nearby postindustrial cities.

Division II in ESSP
Students accomplish their concentration, Division II, during their second and third years, and they design their concentrations with the guidance of a faculty committee. Each Division II is unique and includes courses, internships, and projects. ESSP students especially interested in the sciences might focus on geology, chemistry, biology, ecology or agriculture.

Students focusing in social sciences may study economics, environmental politics and planning or historical aspects of sustainability. Others might choose a more interdisciplinary path and integrate the social and natural sciences or humanities and sciences. Most ESSP concentrations are by nature interdisciplinary.

    Programs, both international and national, are often central to students’ ESSP concentrations. Through the many and diverse opportunities available literally world-wide, students gain authentic experience critical for Division III (the senior thesis).

Some example Division II titles in different areas are:

    » Environmental Science: Conservation Biology; Geology With Focus on Climate Change; Environmental Chemistry
    » Agriculture: Creating a Sense of Place; Agriculture: Bioregionalism and Sustainability; Ethnobotany
    » Design and Technology: Alternative Energy Design and Implementation; Solar and Wind Engineering
    » Sustainable Communities: Land Use and Development in Hadley, Massachusetts: Helping Diverse Ideas Lead to Healthy Decisions; Cultural Ecology; Sustainable Community Design

Division III in ESSP
Division III includes an in-depth project that students work on during their final year at Hampshire. Many ESSP students do summer field projects or internships on and off campus and then return to campus to write a thesis under the supervision of their Division III committee.

Environmental Studies minor
Sustainable Community Development minor","The Environmental Studies programs expect students who are majoring or minoring to demonstrate that they have gained the following skills and competencies from each respective subset of courses below: 
1.     Competency in understanding the interdisciplinary relationships between humans and their environment.
a.     From the Introductory Course: Students will appreciate the interdisciplinary nature and implied complexities of an environmental issue.
b.     From the Natural Sciences Core: Students will demonstrate the ability to interpret quantitative data (maps, charts, graphs, spreadsheets and equations) and utilize scientific inquiry to formulate hypotheses, gather and analyze data.
c.     From the Social Science Core: Students will demonstrate an understanding of the relationships between humans and economic, social, and political thought that affect the natural and human environment.
d.     From the Humanities Core: Students will demonstrate an understanding of philosophical, spiritual, literary, and artistic traditions that affect the natural and human environment.
e.     From the Tools Requirement: Students will demonstrate an understanding of maps and geographic display of data, statistical analysis or writing competency to support their arguments on any environmental issue. 
2.     Ability to identify the multiple dimensions of environmental issues, using the tools and ways of knowing specific to the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.
3.     Competency in being able to locate and access information on environmental issues.
Sustainable Community Development minor is an interdisciplinary program that leverages existing strengths in the departments of environmental studies, architectural studies, economics, biology as well as the Finger Lakes Institute, HWS Office of Sustainability, and the Center for Community Engagement and Service-Learning. One of the main goals of this innovative curricular program is to help undergraduates build real world skills while assisting the Finger Lakes region in becoming more economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable. For instance, students in the Sustainable Community Development Planning and Methods capstone course worked on a collaborative project to assess and revitalize a former brownfield site in the East Lakeview neighborhood of Geneva, N.Y. The students engaged neighbors and a wider group of community members from the East Lakeview Neighborhood Association throughout the semester. In smaller teams, the students studied different aspects of the site to understand the neighborhood context. After phases of site analysis, listening sessions, and preliminary design ideas, the students produced detailed design proposals to convert the brownfield property into an active park and recreation center with many sustainable features for consideration by the East Lakeview Neighborhood Association. 
The Finger Lakes Community Development Center (FLCDC) is the major co-curricular arm of the Sustainable Community Development program and is based at the Finger Lakes Institute. The FLCDC connects Finger Lakes communities seeking sustainable approaches to issues with well-prepared students and faculty and staff members who actively study, research, and present alternatives. Some of our activities include research and analysis on behalf of municipalities, community leaders, agencies, and organizations regarding community sustainability strategies; green business and infrastructure development; guidance for sustainable practices in tourism, food systems, and urban area management; regional environmental resilience planning; conservation and renewable energy issues; and land use policy guidelines to meet pressures for growth while preserving the desired atmosphere.

We are counting graduate students that would have sustainability learning outcomes in their programs. Additionally, we are count that may 2015 students would have graduated via the improved core requirements as they would have had to meet the learning objectives listed below. 

Undergraduate
The Core encourages students to value 
learning and to carry that love of learning 
into their future lives. Valuing learning has  two key components: a distinctively Catholic, humanistic vision of intellectual 
inquiry as well as the cultivation of 
particular skills. Both are necessary for 
students to be thoughtful, critical, and 
engaged citizens of the world.
The Core educates and values the whole 
person. The LMU University Core therefore 
emphasizes the formation of students as 
whole persons, integrated in thinking, 
feeling, and action. As such, the Core 
includes intellectual, creative/artistic, and 
moral development. The Core invites 
students to analyze their relationship to others, to the world, and to 
God. The Core serves faith by bringing students to a critical 
and appreciative understanding of religious 
traditions, and to see the search for God as 
intrinsic to the human condition.
The Core recognizes LMU’s special role in 
creating women and men who will be  discerning and active 
members of diverse communities local and global. The Core 
includes the study of ethical theories and 
moral development, through which students 
come to recognize the value of acting rightly 
and using knowledge mindfully in the 
promotion of justice. 

Integrations courses are meant to serve as 
culminating experiences for the Core 
Curriculum, encouraging students to 
develop a more mindful engagement with 
the world. In these courses, stu dents will 
integrate the knowledge and skills gained in 
the Foundations and Explorations courses 
and their major courses.. For example.. Ethics
and Justice reflects LMU's commitment to the promotion of justice  as a hallmark of the Core by exploring major philosophical, theological and spiritual traditions of ethics, and then engaging students in applying these theories to the ethical 
analysis of situations in a specific 
applied area, such as business ethics, 
war and peace, ecology, and the 
challenges of economic justice.

another example is in the exploration courses students take requirements to fulfill
Nature of Science, Technology, and 
Mathematics engages students to develop the scientific literacy 
necessary for them to become 
knowledgeable citizens of the modern 
world and understand the impact of 
science and technology on society.

To have a foundation in the principles and philosophy of education our minors should be able to understand and apply multiple lenses to examine, debate, and write about critical issues in education policy and practice, that include content and/or discipline specific issues as well as issues of power, privilege, social dominance, and social justice. 

Learning Goals for The Program in Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies:
Our courses are interdisciplinary in nature and students examine the questions raised by the scholarship on gender, sexuality and feminist studies; they learn to critically understand how class, ethnicity, sexuality, and other constructions of difference are influenced and informed by gender.  We draw upon scholarship from the humanities, the social sciences and the natural sciences to highlight the possibilities of social transformation and change.

Learning Goals for American Studies include:
Students who major in American Studies should be able to culturally and historically contextualize a range of identity categories (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, and class).

Learning Goals for Sociology/Anthropology include:
To complete the major, students choose four electives which respond to the sundry agendas that they bring to SOAN. These include international development and human rights work, environmental studies, primary and secondary schoolteaching, medicine and public health, law and advocacy, psychology and social work. Because SOAN comprises two disciplines and attracts majors with such a wide array of interests, our learning goals must be formulated in broad terms.

We expect our students to learn:

    -basic sociological and anthropological concepts;
    -the centrality of class, race and gender in most situations;
    -the value of comparative analysis;
    -the need to evaluate all sources of information critically;
    -the value of questioning received wisdom or common sense;
    -research techniques that will enable them to pursue their own investigations in whatever field they choose.

-       Define sustainability
-       Explain the “Triple Bottom Line” (Economic, Environment, Social)
-       Understand the importance of responsibility for/stewardship of resources (personal and corporate)
-       Consider the three major forces (population, intensity resource usage, climate) that drive all approaches to sustainability
-       Explain intensity of resource usage by applying the “Tragedy of the Commons” to sustainability
-       Understand population statistics and their impact on sustainability
-       Consider the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s impact on corporations

One of our program educational objectives is that early career Biological Engineering graduates will be expected to: ""Effectively identify, analyze and design sustainable solutions to address issues and opportunities throughout the world""",--,"A list of degree programs with sustainability learning outcomes was developed in the following manner: 
(1) A survey was sent to all undergraduate and graduate program officers in 2011, asking them to identify academic programs that focus on sustainability, and additional programs that have specific sustainability learning outcomes.  Programs that met either or both of these criteria were included on the list.
(2) This initial list was reviewed and updated in 2014 by searching though the online University Bulletin, which provides detailed descriptions of all Undergraduate and Graduate degree programs.

Our value for the number of students graduating from programs with sustainability learning outcomes is a conservative one, because it does not include graduates of minor programs, since we lacked sufficient information to avoid double-counting.  Also, we lacked information on degrees awarded by specific inter-college programs, which include several graduate-level sustainability programs.

Interdisciplinary: Environmental Analysis
Majors and minors","Requirements for the Major in Environmental Analysis

The major consists of three sets of requirements:
An Introductory Core set of three courses (EA 010 PO, EA 020 PO, EA 030L JS)
A Concentration: There are two Concentrations in EA from which a student must select one in which to develop a “course plan:”
Environmental Science
Society and the Environment
There are two options for course-plan development within any given Concentration: (1) Select a pre-designed Concentration or Course Plan. (2) Design with your advisor your own Course Plan, including 7 but not exceeding 11 courses total, in addition to the Core and Capstone courses. Individually designed course plans must show depth in some foundational discipline, or set of closely related disciplines, and must be approved by the Steering Committee.
Senior Capstone:
Seniors may fulfill this requirement through either of two options:
Complete a senior thesis (EA 191 PO) in the fall semester for possible Honors if the student achieves an A in the course. In special circumstances the thesis can be extended to a yearlong course.
Enroll in the senior seminar (EA 190 PO) in the spring, and complete a major written project.
Seniors also may choose to complete both of these options.

Pre-approved Concentration Plans:
1. Environmental Science Concentration
(Advisor: Richard Hazlett)

Introductory Core: EA 010 PO, EA 020 PO*, EA 030L JS
Introductory Biology: BIOL 041E PO

",http://assessment.uci.edu/assessment/assessment-of-undergraduate-majors/,"NOTES
UC Irvine’s Academic Senate Assessment Committee has established a policy that departments should (1) establish learning outcomes for each of its undergraduate majors and update learning outcomes as needed (2) assess these learning outcomes on an ongoing basis (3) use results of these assessments to improve teaching and learning and (4) write a report of the results. While the Assessment Committee expects each department to continuously engage in these activities, each department is responsible for submitting an assessment report every five years. Submitted assessment reports are reviewed by the Academic Senate Assessment Committee and the Campus Assessment Coordinator, and learning outcomes are posted for undergraduate degree programs. Since 2008 the Division of Undergraduate Education has sponsored the Assessment Grant Program to support faculty-based activities to assess student learning in undergraduate majors and in general education. The program provides funding for Senate faculty members to either advance a department’s assessment program for an undergraduate major or develop an assessment program for one of the general education student learning outcomes. Because departments are required to submit assessment reports every five years, departmental program descriptions were also reviewed to determine learning outcomes.

In responding to this credit, UC Irvine elected to focus on the undergraduate degree programs. The numbers of graduates reported for this credit reflect degrees awarded in the 2014-2015 Fall-to-Summer Degree Year as described below: 
•  Aggregated number of students awarded a Bachelor’s degree year from a program with at least one sustainability learning outcome (i.e., students awarded degrees from the programs listed above); 
•  Total number of graduates awarded a Bachelor’s degree from all UC Irvine degree programs in the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, the Francisco J. Ayala School of Biological Sciences, The Paul Merage School of Business, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences; the Schools of Humanities, Physical Sciences, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences; and the Programs in Nursing Science, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Public Health. 

As part of a broader effort to ensure that the graduate programs are cutting edge in both content and form and to maximize student success, UC Irvine is developing and assessing Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) for all graduate programs.  In doing so, UCI is committed to several principles:  (1) one size does not fit all, that is, each department or program should develop its own PLOs and assessment mechanisms, (2) an incremental approach in which assessment focuses on the areas that are of greatest interest to program faculty and students, and (3) good faith effort that enables programs to strive for improvement rather than to showcase areas in which they are already excellent.  During the 2011-2012 academic year, a PLO pilot project was launched and the Graduate Council developed guidelines to assist in development of specific learning outcomes for each graduate program, along with evaluative measures. Five departments developed PLO documents and assessment plans that could serve as models for the rest of the campus. In 2012-2013, the Graduate Council required all graduate programs to define program learning outcomes while the pilot working group moved forward with assessment. In 2013-2014, graduate programs were asked to begin to assess PLOs, with an eye to gathering data that will allow programs to make targeted improvements.

UCSD's undergraduate education is organized into six colleges. Each college has its own distinctive educational philosophy and programmatic theme, general education requirements, neighborhood within the UCSD campus, and active student life.

Along with general education course requirements in the sciences, mathematics, fine arts, and humanities, students at UCSD's Marshall College must complete a 3-quarter (1-year) core sequence called Dimensions of Culture (DOC), which explores the development of American society through a complex tapestry of issues related to asymmetries of power associated with gender, class, racial, ethnic, and other hierarchies. All 3 courses address the social and political implications of inequality and the various collective movements that have struggled to gain access to rights and resources. http://admissions.ucsd.edu/colleges/marshall/index.html

UCSD Warren College students must take ethics and society courses. Warren College designed Ethics and Society, PHIL or POLI 27 and PHIL or POLI 28, to help students learn how to make moral decisions, engage in moral reasoning, and understand the positions of others in the great moral conflicts of our time. http://warren.ucsd.edu/academics/ethics-and-society.html

GRADUATE
- Environmental Science and Management (MESM): The program focuses on application and problem-solving and has three parts: the first-year core curriculum, the second-year work in one of seven Specializations, and the Group Project or Eco-Entrepreneurship Project. The Bren School MESM degree involves core curriculum that provides a solid foundation in coupled human and environmental systems. The specializations offered by Bren School include Coastal Marine Resources Management, Conservation Planning, Corporate Environmental Management, Economics and Politics of the Environment, Energy and Climate, Pollution Prevention and Remediation, and Water Resources Management. Lastly, students complete a Group Project or Eco-Entrepreneurship Project focused around coursework that develops skills and experiences that help them pursue new technologies and strategies for addressing society's environmental and resource challenges.
- Environmental Science and Management (PhD): The Bren School’s PhD program is designed to develop the broad knowledge, analytical powers, technical skills, and creative thinking demanded of leaders in Environmental Science & Management. The program is also designed to accommodate a wide range of research interests, from those highly focused in a particular discipline to strongly interdisciplinary ones. All courses offered by the Bren School are open to PhD students. Courses are also available in such other departments as Geography; Earth Science; Economics; Political Science; and Ecology, Evolution & Marine Biology; as well as others. PhD research topics can be as focused or interdisciplinary as the courses. Current research projects include ""Economics of water management, including markets, pricing, auctions, and payments for ecosystem services""; "" Using computational numerical methods to develop a better understanding of energy and material resource management problems that are dynamic over space and time""; and ""Environmental impacts of energy technologies and agricultural systems, approaches for regionalizing life cycle inventory, and China's environmental issues.""
- Global Studies (MA): Graduate students will acquire a basic understanding of major ideas and writings and acquire an in-depth knowledge of the kinds of subjects, issues, and problems that constitute the three broad interdisciplinary specializations that comprise our M.A. curriculum: global political economy, sustainability and the environment; global culture, ideology, and religion; and global governance, civil society, and human rights",http://www.sustainability.ucsb.edu/slo/,"We focused on program-level learning outcomes because this was the level where we had the most complete set of outcomes.

The above calculation includes the number of students who graduated from a program with at least one sustainability learning outcome over the past three years (2012-13; 2013-14; 2014-15). This total number of graduates from all degree programs is likewise calculated over the past three years (2012-13; 2013-14; 2014-15).

We likely double-counted on double-majors, due to the difficulty in separating that data out.

Learning outcomes were mostly pulled from the Assessment of Student Learning, completed as part of the WASC Accreditation process (http://assessment.ucsb.edu/plo). We used the WASC outcomes to justify undergraduate learning outcomes.

We could not find specific program-level outcomes at the Graduate level; the WASC outcomes were more general and did not adequately address each specific program. For this, we used information from credit AC 4 (Graduate Programs). More information about the PhD and MESM in Environmental Science and Management can be found below, respectively:
http://bren.ucsb.edu/academics/phd.html
http://bren.ucsb.edu/academics/MESM.html

In reporting, we ensured that we only included degree programs with learning outcomes that addressed all three components of sustainability: environment, economy, and society, or that at least included environmental issues and broadly addressed “impacts to society” (which we counted as the social/economic side).

The courses are taught by senior tenured professors from the Social Sciences, Physical and Biological Sciences, and Engineering Divisions of UCSC. The goal of the core course sequence is to provide students with a solid scientific and policy foundation for environmental citizenship. Since its creation in 1972, College Eight has been a crucial component of the university's world renowned Environmental, Ecological and Sustainability programs and initiatives. The College also offers a minor in Sustainability, available to students in any major.

College Nine. The core course (required for all students) and classes offered through College Nine provide students with hands-on learning opportunities to engage in discourse around Global Themes. Students have the opportunity to explore their interests through classes like the Community Garden, a hands-on sustainable agriculture experience focusing on building community and ecological systems. 

College Ten. College Ten's theme and required core course is on Social Justice and Community. Our corresponding motto is ""justice for all."" Through the frosh seminar (for all students), optional workshops, and co-curricular activities, we pay special attention to individuals and groups who are denied opportunities offered to more privileged members of society. Some of the issues we consider are racism, sexism, ageism, and other forms of discrimination. Other matters that are addressed include poverty, greed, ethnic hatreds, violence against the queer community, and environmental injustices.

For 2014-2015 academic year, this included Bachelor’s degrees from the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the School of Engineering, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences as well as various diplomas and certificates from various other schools with academic coursework in the departments listed below. These departments are all part of colleges with sustainability learning outcomes described in their mission statements (found in link below) and with sustainability focused and related courses as part of their department. Also in the link below are the remaining Associates, Doctorates, Masters, and Bachelors awarded with sustainability learning outcomes that were not within the parameters said earlier. 

http://www.ecohusky.uconn.edu/docs/ecohusky/Learning%20Outcomes.pdf","List/sample of sustainability learning outcomes associated with degree, diploma, or certificate programs: From the current University Academic Plan:
""Members of the University community are committed to freedom of academic inquiry and expression and dedicated to excellence as demonstrated in the national and international recognition of our faculty, students, and programs. We create and disseminate knowledge by means of our scholarly and creative achievements, graduate and professional programs, and outreach to the community. 

“Through teaching and learning, we help students grow intellectually and become contributing members of the state, national, and world communities. Through research, teaching, and service, we embrace diversity and cultivate leadership, integrity, and engaged citizenship in our students, faculty, staff, and alumni. And through our work as a land and sea grant institution, we promote the health and well-being of Connecticut’s citizens and enhance the social, economic, cultural, and natural environments of the state and beyond.""

UConn’s brand new Academic plan outlines the mission statements of colleges. Our interns read through these statements and determined that the following college descriptions closely related to the terms of sustainability in the Earth Charter. The colleges included were College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources, School of Nursing, School of Business, School of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the School of Nursing.

CAHNR: CAHNR has identified two major areas of strength and opportunity that contribute to improving quality-of-life issues and supporting economic growth in the 21st century:
a)	Food, Nutrition, and Health
b)	Environmental and Agricultural Sustainability.
These areas of strength are intimately connected because healthy and sustainable environments are the foundation for healthy individuals, families, and communities. Connecticut has a strong and vibrant agricultural economy delivering food, forest products, and plants and plant products to citizens across New England and the Northeast.  CAHNR provides the science, technology, and educational outreach needed to promote healthy lifestyles, sustain a diverse and resilient agricultural economy, protect the natural resource base in Connecticut, and guide sensible and sustainable development that will help citizens and communities adapt to climate change.
The College of Agriculture and Natural Resources offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in eight academic departments, and has an increasing presence in health-based programming, economics, environmental sciences, and food safety. The College is highly engaged in programs and centers focusing on food, nutrition and health, and environmental and agricultural sustainability. These areas of strength are intimately connected— healthy and sustainable environments serve as the foundation for healthy individuals, families, and communities. Connecticut has a strong and vibrant agricultural economy delivering food, forest products, and plants and plant products to citizens across New England and the Northeast. UConn provides the science, technology, and educational outreach needed to promote healthy lifestyles, sustain a diverse and resilient agricultural economy, protect the state’s natural resource base, and guide sensible and sustainable development. The College is the second-fastest growing college of agriculture in the nation, and has several programs that rank in the top one-third nationally.
School of Business: The School of Business offers numerous master’s and doctoral programs including three MBA programs—full-time, executive, and part-time; three specialized masters programs —accounting, business analytics and project management, and financial risk management; and a full-time Ph.D. program. It also offers a broad set of undergraduate majors in its BS degree program. Among its research strengths are a cluster of creativity, entrepreneurship, and organizational behavior scholars in the management department; a cluster of analytical scholars who will contribute to our big data and complex systems thrust in the marketing department, which is also highly rated by the Association of American Universities; and a strong body of analytical scholars in the operations and information management department. The School is developing strengths in its healthcare administration and insurance groups, both important for the economy of the state of Connecticut and Next Generation Connecticut.

The School of Engineering: The School of Engineering offers undergraduate and graduate degrees across engineering disciplines in seven departments, including the newly established biomedical engineering department that integrates science, engineering, and medicine to improve the quality of life. The School has exceptional students, strong scholarship in terms of knowledge generation and application, and vibrant publicprivate partnerships with major economic impact on the state and beyond.

The College had more than $43 million dollars of research expenditures in 2013, with significant external funding across the behavioral, life, environmental, and physical sciences. The College has enhanced its life and physical science faculty in the areas of genetics and genomics to collaborate with the UConn Health Center and The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine facilities in Farmington. The College has been at the forefront of environmental research, teaching, and outreach, with strong expertise in the natural and social sciences as well as ongoing interdisciplinary research initiatives related to environmental sustainability, biodiversity, and global environmental change. With ongoing interdisciplinary work on cognitive science between philosophers, linguists, behavioral scientists, and neurobiologists, we have a unique capacity for understanding language and the human mind. The College is the University’s home for research in the humanities, and includes strong programs in history, including early American and Latin American history, American and English literature, medieval studies, and world languages and culture. The College also supports a collection of programs and institutes focusing on race and gender with a vision of studying the relevant regions of the world and the populations from those regions as they have migrated across the globe.

The School of Nursing: The School of Nursing offers prelicensure and graduate programs with many advanced practice nursing specialties at the master’s and doctoral levels. The School is designated as a National League for Nursing Center of Excellence in Nursing Education based on the pedagogical expertise of its faculty. It offers a well-regarded interdisciplinary certificate in health professions education and is the largest provider of nurses and nursing faculty in Connecticut. Research expertise in the School has a long-standing and international reputation in maternal-infant health, including postpartum mood and anxiety disorders and high-risk infant development. Gerontology and aging research, particularly with vulnerable populations, is another area of strength. The School also hosts an emerging center in correctional health managed care. The School is known for its clinical partner collaborative relationships, where faculty hold joint appointments designed to enhance patient care and health outcomes.

Additionally, all UConn students are able, in any given day, to take classes in subjects ranging from puppetry to linguistics to digital marketing to Renaissance art. They can conduct research in a genomics lab or pursue funding for a “UConn Idea” grant in an interdisciplinary area that integrates social sciences, humanities, and technology. They can choose to study and intern abroad in Heidelberg, Germany, or participate in a social entrepreneurship experience in Guatemala. They can select from more than 800 student activities or service initiatives. These programs will continue to be refined and updated to ensure an undergraduate educational experience that prepares our students for lives of impact and leadership in an increasingly diverse, globalized world by emphasizing problem solving and the capacity to translate knowledge and curricular content into real-world experiences.

Master's and PhD programs in Earth Sciences, Natural Resources, Resource Economics, and Environmental Education","Discovery in the Disciplines
Biological Sciences

Biology is a branch of science that investigates the structure and function of living organisms. Scientists investigate ideas and observations that solidify our understanding of the diversity of life from single cells to complex organisms. Biology has deep relations with agriculture, chemistry, psychology, and many other fields of study, and it is the foundation of our knowledge regarding health and diseases. Individual courses under this category deal with the basic structure and function of medicine. Courses under this category deal with the basic structure and function of organisms, the interaction of organisms with their environment, human health, biotechnology, and the concepts and mechanisms of evolution as a fundamental biological paradigm. All courses will provide some understanding of the methods of scientific inquiry as it seeks knowledge about the living world.

Environment, Technology, and Society

The exponential growth of the sciences and engineering has bred an equally dramatic growth in technological advances. From the flint arrowhead to the latest communication, device or weapon, human beings have been inventing things and transforming their lives, their societies, and their environments as they do. But they seldom foresee all the transformations and consequences their inventions bring about. This category stresses the interplay between at least two of these three realms: environment, technology and society. Topics might include, but are not limited to, the history of a particular kind of technology (such as transport, fuel, writing, or weaponry), how technological change comes about in general, the scientific and/or social bases for a given technology, its impact for good or ill on human society and the natural environment, the effects of a changing environment on the arts and literature, and/or the ethical questions these topics raise.

Fine and Performing Arts

The arts communicate through the intellect, the emotions, and the body, sometimes all at once, in ways simple and subtle, direct and subliminal, gentle and soul-shaking. Understanding and appreciating them enriches our lives and preserves our cultural heritage for the future. Through its performances, publications, and exhibits, UNH offers many artistic experiences for students and the larger community, some of which are linked to courses under this category. Such courses, which may be about painting, sculpture, architecture, music, dance, theater, or film, will often include learning through practical experience.

Historical Perspectives

Even though we are faced daily with evidence of change in our social world and technology, we easily forget that how we live, where we live, and what we see around us are transient states of affairs. It is important to be able to look on one’s own world with an imaginative grasp of its history and the forces behind that history. Courses under this category will give students the opportunity to learn about major historical developments and how these developments have shaped contemporary life in all its complexity. Through the study of particular periods and places, students will gain both “historical perspective” and some skill at the methods of historical inquiry. Common to all courses in historical analysis is the presumption that the categories of social analysis are themselves historical and historically contingent, and that to understand the past requires entering imaginatively into languages, institutions, and worldviews quite different from those of the present day.

Humanities

The humanities arose in Renaissance universities as an alternative to theology and consisted mainly of Greek and Latin literature, which dealt with any and every aspect of human life; they became central to the liberal arts. Since the nineteenth century, the humanities have also embraced modern literature, the creative arts, philosophy, and history. They focus on questions about meaning, ethics, aesthetics, and the foundations of knowledge; they are as concerned with form as with content. Courses under this category explore major works, ideas, and traditions that have shaped our understandings of the world and our sense of self at different times and places while examining the distinctive methods of humanistic inquiry.

Physical Sciences

The physical sciences seek to discover the components, structures, properties, and laws of the material world from subatomic particles to the entire universe. Through them, we appreciate both the wondrous complexity of the world and its order. The traditional domains of chemistry, physics, astronomy, cosmology, and earth sciences are the foundations of knowledge in numberless arenas of human activity, while the intersections between these domains and the biological sciences yield astonishing discoveries about living organisms. All courses will provide some understanding of the methods of scientific inquiry as it seeks knowledge about the physical universe, as well as evaluate claims about it in both technical literature and popular media.

Quantitative Reasoning

Quantitative reasoning refers to the ability to think critically and analytically using abstract formal methods with broad application. Mathematics is the foundation for the physical sciences and, increasingly, for the biological sciences. Its principles and processes illuminate significant aspects of the social sciences as well. In its most precise forms, it enables the design of bridges and the orbiting of satellites. Mathematics discloses invisible truths about the world, makes sense of patterns of which we may or may not be aware, and introduces some order to chaos. In its purest form, it creates its own world of beauty and logic. In its more applied forms, it attempts to make sense of individual and collective human behaviors and complex systems. Many courses listed under this category will help students appreciate the principles of mathematics and gain some skill in its applications to realistic situations, while other courses will introduce kindred subjects including symbolic logic, information theory, statistics, and computer science.

Social Sciences

The social sciences investigate human beings and their societies from the smallest bands of hunter gatherers to huge nations and global institutions. Everything from marriage and kinship to law and crime, from ceremonial gift giving to mortgage derivatives, from witchcraft to health insurance, from ancient ritual to modern communication, is a subject of a social science. As the world grows more interrelated and complex, the tools of the social sciences grow in importance. Courses under this category will explore different theories, methods, and data-gathering techniques as they apply to different social issues. They also will examine how individuals create, interact with, and are shaped by, social groups and institutions, including those associated with politics, economics, religion, family, the arts, health, and education.

World Cultures

Living in a world of many cultures has created both cooperation and conflict across borders, among and between nations. This category, which includes intermediate language courses and approved study abroad programs, encourages students to become cosmopolitan citizens by gaining knowledge and understanding of cultures other than those of the United States. Students will learn to recognize others' values and, ultimately, accept the many ways in which we all are human. They are thus encouraged to see their own culture with fresh eyes and know the sheer diversity of human outlooks.",http://unh.edu/discovery/category_descriptions,See also http://www.sustainableunh.unh.edu/curriculum.

Environmental studies integrates the study of interactions among physical, chemical and biological components of the environment. Students take many courses in the natural sciences, but not at the expense of courses in the social sciences and humanities. The field has grown substantially since the 1960s, as public awareness of environmental problems grew. The public began to rely on informed scientists to recommend practical public policies and environmental standards. Today, environmental scientists study issues like climate change, conservation, biodiversity, pollution, natural resource usage, waste management and sustainable development. Environmental studies is an applications-oriented field, and courses in the program prepare you to approach environmental problems from a wide variety of perspectives and disciplines. The courses all tend to be intensely interdisciplinary; students are being prepared to use the methods and theories from many branches in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to interpret and solve environmental problems. Since there are rarely any easy answers to environmental problems, students in environmental studies courses also learn to think critically and analyze environmental issues from the perspective of a variety of competing stakeholders. Professors emphasize clear and jargon-free communication so that the results of student research can be presented in a manner accessible across the disciplines. The Environmental Studies Program requires that all majors participate in some kind of experiential, or active, learning opportunity before graduating. To help students quantify their experiences and guarantee that they’re ready for graduate study or careers in environmental studies, the program requires at least two elective hours of experiential learning, either through taking ENVR 388 or ENVR 320. The most standard ways to earn credit include participating in an environmental internship or doing supervised, independent research on an environmental topic.

Geography and the Environment - Geography cultivates informed and engaged global citizens through an emphasis on integrative problem solving, spatial analysis, and communication skills. Our department bridges the natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities to provide a better understanding of the earth's cultural and biological diversity. The discipline of geography seeks to understand the transformation of the earth in relationship to both human and environmental processes and serves as a bridge between the natural and social sciences. Spatial theories (scale, location, place, and connectivity) allow geographers to critically analyze change in the cultural, physical and economic landscape. Students find geography’s interdisciplinary nature combines well with other programs and fields of study such as international studies, environmental studies, biology and economics. All Geography majors must fulfill an experiential learning component to supplement their classroom instruction at the University of Richmond. Examples include an approved semester of study abroad, an internship or volunteer position equaling approximately 100 hours of service, a summer field course (e.g., master naturalist), or another educational and hands-on initiative agreed upon by the student
and faculty supervisor. Ideally, this experiential learning involves significant outdoor or cross-cultural experience and is not a laboratory, classroom, or office-based activity.",Human relationship to natural world; Inter-relationships; Awareness of environmental issues; Environmental problem solving; Critical thinking; Analytical thinking; Communication skills; Active citizenry.,http://environmental.richmond.edu/,"Geography and the Environment: http://geography.richmond.edu/

Students should be able to define basic concepts and principles in environmental and sustainability studies, across disciplines. 
Action Steps to Achieve Intended Outcome
The core course ESST 2300 will include basic concepts and principles in environmental and sustainability studies across the disciplines.
Assessment Methodology Description
The Director of the ESS Minor will ask the instructor of the core course, ESST 2300 to fill out a form assessing students’ abilities to define and apply basic concepts and principles in environmental and sustainability studies. The instructor will base this assessment on the student’s final exam or final project performance. The instructor will send the data to the Director of the ESS Minor who will report it as required. The criteria for success is that 80% of the students will have scored 4 or 5 on a 5 point scale, ranging from 1 (no ability to define basic concepts and principles of environmental and sustainability studies) to 5 (excellent ability to define or apply basic concepts and principles of environmental and sustainability studies.)

Results:  0% rated 1;  8% rated 2; 58% rated 3; 17% rated 4; 17% rated 5. 
Less than 10% received a below average score; most of the students scored in the middle, and 34% received a high score. This is a solid outcome, yet the high standard we set for success—80% of students receiving a 4 or 5—has not yet been met. There is room for improvement. 

Proposed Changes:  Instructors of ESST 2300 will emphasize core concepts in environmental and sustainability studies throughout the course, requiring students demonstrate their understanding of them. The Director of the ESS Minor will communicate this goal to the instructors of the core course.

Global Studies - Environments + Sustainability Major
The program prepares students to understand, innovate, and lead efforts to sustainably transform the physical environment.

Master of Architecture
Among the learning outcomes of the professional degree is:
Develop the next generation of civic and professional leaders through...Ecologically and culturally sustainable practices as a foundation for design.

Global Development Studies Major
An interdisciplinary undergraduate major
An interdisciplinary major with a focus on social justice, sustainable economic development, public health, global interconnection, and public service.

Environmental Thought & Practice
Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Major
""The objective of the Environmental Thought and Practice program is to produce students who can:
1. comprehend and think critically about scientific information, economic analysis, and the various ethical constructs that enter into environmental decisions; and,
2. appreciate how political and social context, historical events, and cultural expectations shape the way we perceive and solve environmental problems.""

Sustainability Minor
Undergraduate Minor Program
The foundation course for the Sustainability Minor is the Global Sustainability course, which has the following learning goals:
-Understand a broad range of resource and environmental constraints on the quality of human lives.
-Be able to identify a local problem related to sustainability, identify the key stakeholders and their roles and needs, articulate a vision to address that problem, develop project objectives, design a plan to achieve the objectives, and marshall the resources to execute the plan.
-Develop a commitment to bringing about sustainable change.

Urban and Environmental Planning
BUEP
MUEP
Planning Program Description: 
""One of the distinctive features of the program is a strong concern for community sustainability. While the topic is addressed in specific courses with that title, the concept of sustainability provides an underlying framework throughout the curriculum...we are as much concerned with the economy and issues of equity as we are with the environment, and find it more useful to emphasize linkages than distinctions.""

Civil and Environmental Engineering
""Civil and Environmental Engineering is centered on two main program areas: environmental and water resources engineering and civil infrastructure systems. Incorporating elements of sustainability, each program area features adaptive design with a strong focus on the incorporation of information technology. Civil infrastructure systems, including both the natural environment and built systems to support basic human needs, serve as the very underpinning of society. Improvements in civil infrastructure result in improved human health and quality of life.""

Global Studies - Global Public Health
To foster the capacity to understand and address the complex cultural, social, political, economic, and environmental conditions and pathways that affect health, health care access, and quality of life around the world; to increase knowledge about the causes and distribution of global health burdens; and to catalyze innovative approaches for improving the health of populations and achieving health equity.

Environmental Sciences
Environmental Sciences is an interdisciplinary field focusing on the interactions between processes that shape our natural environment.  The Department of Environmental Sciences conducts research and offers instruction in the areas of Ecology, Geoscience, Hydrology, and Atmospheric Science.  This unique integration of various Earth sciences and ecology within a single, academic department offers majors an opportunity to understand scientific processes and problems related to the environment.  The research efforts of both faculty and students, whether disciplinary or interdisciplinary, address problems of fundamental scientific interest.

Sustainability is about working towards a future in which all human beings can enjoy decent quality of life– good health, economic security, membership in strong and inclusive communities, the list goes on– while ensuring that we do not endanger the natural resources and environments upon which we depend. At its core, sustainability is about helping us live up to our fullest potential, as individuals and as a society. Making our way towards sustainability will involve addressing some very big and complicated problems– problems that will not have just single answers, or answers generated by single perspectives. Educating our students about sustainability means presenting them with multiple perspectives and teaching them how to critically evaluate the pros and cons, costs and consequences of the many options that lie before us. Sustainability is not about prescription, or about liberal or conservative points of view; it is about thoughtfully questioning, analyzing, and coming up with creative solutions. And isn’t this exactly what we want our students to be able to do?

Specific learning outcomes listed for programs include:

First Year Experience: ""Gain an understanding of their own role as members of a global community and their responsibility to participate in that community in a way that takes into account sustainability.""

Environmental Studies: ""Students will be able to critically analyze the concept of sustainability and its three pillars (economic security, social equity, ecological responsibility) and the way this concept is applied and used.""

","o	American Studies - The American Studies program is an interdisciplinary program that enables students to engage the diversity of American culture from a variety of intellectual disciplines and perspectives. Through course offerings, colloquia, and research opportunities, program students and faculty engage with the states of the nation in a post-9/11 era, examining anew the formation of social, legal, cultural, and economic identities within the borders of the United States. Compelling matters of class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, environmentalism, technology, the arts, region, and religion take their proper and vital place in the curriculum of study.
o	Biological Sciences - The biological sciences encompass the study of living organisms and life processes at all levels: ecosystems, populations, individual organisms, tissues, cells, subcellular structures, and molecules. For undergraduates, the department offers three majors including the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB) major. The EEOB major is designed for students with an interest in ecology, evolutionary biology, environmental biology, and conservation biology.
o	Chemistry - Environmental Chemistry Focus. Environmental chemistry concerns the chemical phenomena that occur in nature. Environmental chemistry spans atmospheric, aquatic, and soil chemistry with a reliance on analytical chemistry for methods of analysis. Environmental chemistry can be applied to the understanding of issues such as ground water pollution, wastewater treatment, ozone depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions. 
o	The Earth and Environmental Sciences are aimed at interpreting Earth’s dynamic history—its age and origin as recorded in rocks and the landscape—and at understanding how geological processes affect modern environmental and ecological systems. Students majoring in EES participate in field and laboratory work. Students use the major as preparation for graduate study, for careers in environmental studies and resource exploration (petroleum, minerals), or for related careers in such fields as land use planning, teaching, law, or engineering. Research programs in the department, which in many cases involve students, employ field, analytical, and experimental methods. 
o	Environmental and Sustainability Studies - Human beings and their societies necessarily interact with and alter Earth’s natural environment. The environmental and sustainability studies minor allows the student to examine human interaction with the environment from the perspectives of the humanities and social sciences with some exposure to the environmental sciences and/or environmental engineering. 
o	Civil and Environmental Engineering - Civil engineers must be able to face complex problems of modern society involving the development of physical facilities that serve the public while protecting the environment and preserving social values. Challenges facing civil and environmental engineers concern housing, urban transportation, pollution control, water resources development, industrial development, maintaining and advancing our nation’s aging infrastructure, and exploring space. The program also includes courses in economics, humanities, social sciences, resources management, and public policy. The curriculum includes upper-level analysis and design courses in structural, geotechnical, environmental, water resources, and transportation engineering. In addition, a major in chemical engineering with a minor in environmental engineering is available.
o	Department of Sociology – Environmental Sociology - Vanderbilt’s Department of Sociology launched its new environmental sociology major in 2015, the first environmental and sustainability studies major outside the sciences and engineering at Vanderbilt and one of the first such majors in the country. Students enrolled in the major receive a grounding in environmental science and general sociology, then focus on social questions surrounding environmental issues. Courses cover ecology and society, population and migration, environmental health, social movements and social change, business and civil society, green jobs, government policy and more. http://as.vanderbilt.edu/sociology/undergraduate/environmental-sociology-major/

Earth Science
Geography
Urban Studies
Science, Technology & Society","Environmental Studies
Environmental Studies is multidisciplinary in focus, involving the natural and social sciences, as well as the arts and humanities. It explores the relationships between people and the totality of their environments—natural, built, and social. As part of that exploration, environmental studies concerns itself with the description and analysis of natural systems; with interspecies and species-environment relationships and the institutions, policies and laws that affect those relationships; with aesthetic portrayals of nature and how those affect human perceptions and behavior toward it; and with ethical issues raised by the human presence in the environment.

Earth Science & Geography
Earth Science introduces majors & non-majors to the ways in which scientists approach problem solving and investigation in areas such as geohazards, oceanography, landscape and history, environmental justice, earth resource challenges, and the earth around us. 

Geography
Geography emphasizes the spatial study of society from a variety of theoretical perspectives and analytical scales, ranging from local places to larger regions and global systems. For example, geographers examine the allocation and use of world resources, the spatial dynamics of metropolitan areas, political geographies of social problems and human rights, or the roles of political borders in contemporary global affairs. Topical courses offer systematic perspectives on issues such as urban geography, the conservation of natural resources, and economic geography.

Urban Studies
Urban Studies supports a multidisciplinary approach to thinking critically about how we live in cities and know them as objects of study and human intervention. The program orients student inquiry toward the physical city (as pursued by the social sciences and disciplines of urban design), as well the city's implication in social difference, poverty, globalization, suburbanization, and other symbolic and structural phenomena (as examined across the humanities and social sciences)

Science, Technology & Society
The program strives 1) to understand better the central role of science and technology in contemporary society; 2) to consider the social, political, philosophical, and cultural implications of human experience in a technological society; and 3) to explore possible directions of future development, using alternative social theories and perceptions.

Sustainable business major and minor

Peace & Justice Studies minor","ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The goals of the Environmental Studies Program are the following:

To develop an interdisciplinary understanding of the interconnectedness of humans and Earth, promoting sustainability with a respect for natural systems.
To produce leaders in six sub-disciplines within environmental studies who have the ability to develop and critically assess appropriately-scaled environmental decisions leading to sustainability.
To improve students’ abilities to think critically, apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, and communicate ideas.
To develop and promote a holistic integration of the triad of academics, work, and service.
To provide preparation and guidance for continued professional study and/or careers in fields that promote sustainability.

SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS:
The mission of the Business Department is to provide students with the skills and experience necessary to make decisions, solve problems, and devise policies that are socially, environmentally, and economically sound. With a focus on three Ps – People, Planet, and Profits – the business curriculum prepares students to become leaders in their businesses, organizations, and communities. The business degree culminates with a capstone sequence in Sustainable Business, where students research, design, start-up, and operate their own sustainable venture.

The goals of the Sustainable Business Program are the following:
•        To prepare students to work effectively as business leaders and professionals in a complex and changing world.
•        To provide students with a foundation of business knowledge and skills that enables them to pursue further business studies as well as a lifetime of learning.
•        To prepare students to make socially, environmentally, and economically sound contributions to their businesses, organizations, and communities.


PEACE & JUSTICE STUDIES
The mission of the Peace and Justice Studies Program is to help students gain the knowledge and skills necessary to become active, positive contributors to decisions, policies, and leadership in their communities and work places.
Peace and Justice Studies addresses themes of conflict resolution, nonviolent social change, human rights, social and environmental justice, and peacemaking efforts on the local, regional and global levels. A Peace and Justice Studies minor can fruitfully complement practically any major offered at Warren Wilson College.

The goals of the Peace and Justice Studies Program are the following:
•        To develop knowledge of the causes of conflicts and the ways of preventing or resolving them.
•        To learn how respect for human rights and the natural environment contributes to peace.
•        To become conversant with peace philosophies and the works of major peace advocates.
•        To apply conflict resolution skills to contemporary issues.

SOCIAL WORK
The Social Work major is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The mission of the Social Work Program is to provide students preparation for beginning-level entry into the profession of social work through an undergraduate generalist social work education that is educationally sound, academically challenging, ethically principled, and socially relevant, and which is solidly framed by the Triad experience of service, work, and education in the liberal arts.
The goals of the Social Work Program are the following:

•        To prepare practitioners for baccalaureate level generalist social work practice with diverse populations and multigenerational client systems of various sizes and types.
•        To prepare individuals to live in a global society committed to personal growth and contributing to the common good.
•        To foster the development of values and ethics related to the NASW Code of Ethics that guide professional social workers in their practice.
•        To prepare practitioners with a commitment to continuing their professional growth and development as a component of social work practice.
•        To prepare practitioners to practice effectively in the global, political, social, cultural, economic, technological, and spiritual environments of the 21st century.

The Warren Wilson College Social Work Program offers three areas of focus, which are reflected in the Program Objectives and are infused throughout the curriculum. The three areas are as follows:

Multigenerational Practice – As the population ages, multiple generations co-exist as never before. Social workers today need to be skilled and knowledgeable about multigenerational needs, issues, and opportunities. Whether they work with children, teens, the elderly, communities, or social policies, social workers are bound to work with multiple generations at once. This particular area of focus is supported by the CSWE Gero-Ed Curriculum Development Institute, of which the Warren Wilson College Social Work Program is a participant.

International/Global Perspective – As the world becomes more and more “globalized,” it is essential for social workers to approach their work with a global perspective. As students prepare for their profession, the understanding of global interdependence will aid them in working with client systems, whether domestically or abroad. The Social Work Program is affiliated with the Council on International Educational Exchange, which supports this area of focus.

Environmental Sustainability – As the state of the physical and natural environments has become more urgent, social work can no longer afford to ignore the effects of environmental degradation on people and communities or the relationship between social and environmental justice. Social workers today must be skilled and knowledgeable about our physical and natural surroundings as much as our social environments.

OUTDOOR LEADERSHIP
The mission of the Outdoor Leadership Studies Program is to prepare graduates who will have the academic background, skills, and experience necessary to analyze, plan, implement, administer, and supervise outdoor adventure education programs.

The goals of the Outdoor Leadership program are the following:
•        To foster an understanding of the basic concepts of outdoor leadership through an integrated liberal arts and professional training curriculum.
•        To prepare leaders who can analyze, plan, implement, administer, and supervise outdoor adventure education programs.
•        To develop leaders who understand the moral responsibilities of leadership and exercise leadership to promote sustainable communities.

B.S. IN SUSTAINABILITY: COMMUNITIES & DEVELOPMENT","Environmental Studies: We offer three major programs of study provided through home academic departments and an interdisciplinary minor program of study. Our majors and minor include common courses from many disciplines across Arts & Sciences and the University, capturing the strengths of both the traditional academic departments and the interdisciplinary innovation necessary to fully explore the multiple issues and questions posed in the study of the environment. The study of the environment, ranging from science to policy, is a dynamic field. Washington University is a leader in research on global climate change and energy, sustainable food production, the environment and human health, and biodiversity conservation.

Environmental Earth Science: The Environmental Earth Sciences (EES) major provides students with a grounding in the geosciences, forming a basis for the interdisciplinary study of critical environmental topics. Student understanding of environmental science is fostered both by a broad base of coursework across the natural sciences, and by the unique context and perspective earth science provides on the complexity of environmental systems.

Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering: Chemical engineers are involved in the transfer of scientific discoveries to modern technologies and novel products that benefit society and minimize the impact on the environment. They deal with multiscale aspects of generating clean energy, producing novel and superior materials, and utilizing the biological revolution to manufacture new products. They are involved in the development and manufacture of consumer products, as well as in design, operation, and control of processes in a variety of industries (e.g., petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, consumer products, food, feed, pharmaceuticals). Their broad training in basic sciences (e.g., chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics) coupled with a strong foundation in chemical engineering principles (e.g., thermodynamics, mass and energy balances, transport phenomena, kinetics, separations, reaction engineering, control, product development, and process design) makes them invaluable team members and leaders in any engineering enterprise. It also prepares them well for graduate studies in biochemical, biomedical, chemical, environmental, and materials engineering. In addition, the B.S. degree in chemical engineering is a great starting point for pursing a degree in business, law, or medicine.

BS in Sustainability: The Bachelor of Science in Sustainability provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and resolving today’s most pressing and complex environmental, economic, and social challenges. The program is built on a foundation of Arts & Sciences courses that examine sustainable living from multiple perspectives--scientific, political, economic, social, historical, philosophical, anthropological, and literary. Grounded in this integrative approach and common understanding of the issues, students then choose one of three concentrations for greater in-depth study of sustainability:

Sustainable Environment and Science, for primary focus on environmental sciences, natural resources, and energy;
Sustainable Management and Organizations, for primary focus on sustainable business strategies and the triple bottom line—economic, social, environmental; and
Sustainable Communities and Development, for primary focus on designing and managing sustainable spaces in our cities and communities.
These three concentrations include selected courses from Arts & Sciences, Business, Engineering, and Architecture. The overarching goal of the Bachelor of Science in Sustainability is to provide students with knowledge and methods about sustainability, local to global, and to help improve the quality of individual lives, the productivity of institutions, and the security of our planet.",http://enst.wustl.edu/programs,"https://msw.wustl.edu/your-msw/curriculum/concentrations/

Sustainability Certificate Program","Goals for the Environmental Studies Major/Minor
The Environmental Studies program seeks to educate students to:
•  Develop and compare potential solutions to environmental problems from local to global scales.
•  Critically assess the relationships among the cultural, economic, ethical, scientific, and social dimensions of environmental issues.
•  Integrate field-based, laboratory, and other forms of research used by scholars and practitioners.
•  Build ability and confidence in communicating information to professional and public audiences.  
•  Create a cohesive and supportive interdepartmental community.

Sustainability Certificate Program Mission/Goals
Addressing the challenge of using Earth’s resources sustainably requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, in which basic research about the causes and consequences of environmental problems is combined with an understanding of the incentives and processes for a large-scale reworking of economic activity and the technology with which to reconfigure the human effect on the natural world. Wellesley, Olin, and Babson Colleges are uniquely suited to address this challenge by providing a joint program capable of educating students in ways that each cannot accomplish alone. By truly integrating business, engineering, and the liberal arts in the service of environmental sustainability, this program will provide students with the cross-disciplinary academic preparation and the cross-campus cultural collaboration experiences needed to approach environmental issues holistically. This certificate program can serve as a complement to an Environmental Studies major or to any other major.
