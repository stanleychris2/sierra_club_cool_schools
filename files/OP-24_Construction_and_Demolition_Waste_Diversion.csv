While this EO primarily indicates consideration of measures to conserve water and energy, it also expressly indicates that materials and equipment with longlife cycles should be used as well as sustainable building products.
2. Additionally, Planning includes in its general packets for campus builds verbiage entitled ""Construction and Demolition Materials Recycling Requirements"". This verbiage includes, but is not limited to the following:
--The requirements of waste diversion as outlined by California Assembly Bill 75 to include a mandatory 50% reduction of source materials sent to California landfills.
--It requires that any projects designed with the intentions of obtaining a LEED certification must submit, as part of its proposal, documentation of compliance with ""Materials and Resource Credit 2.1"" and ""Materials or Resources Credit 2.2 Construction Waste Management"".
--A contractor must include in a proposal a ""Contractor's Construction Waste and Recycling Plan"" prior to commencement of work.
--A contractor must complete and submit quantitative reports for construction waste materials as a condition of ""the approval of the third progress payment.""

a.	The following materials will be separated and handled in the following manner: 
i.	Ferrous Metals
1.	All ferrous metals such as metal stud framing, ductwork, electrical equipment, etc. will be separated and taken to Mervis Industries. Due to the anticipated minimal amount of this type of material, we will pile materials and load into a truck for delivery to the recycling center. At time of delivery, the load will be weighed and tickets will be documented.
ii.	Non-Ferrous Metals
1.	All non-ferrous metals such as copper and aluminum will be separated and taken to Goodman & Wolfe. Due to the anticipated minimal amount of this type of material, we will pile materials and load into a truck for delivery to the recycling center. At time of delivery, the load will be weighed and tickets will be documented.
iii.	Untreated Lumber, Plywood, OSB, Particle Board, and Drywall
1.	Due to limited amounts, if any, these types of materials will be placed in a dumpster for transport to C&D landfill.
iv.	Cardboard, Paper & Beverage Containers
1.	These materials will be separated and stockpiled on the jobsite and taken to ISU Recycling Center for processing. Estimated weight of materials will be documented. 
v.	Plumbing Fixtures, Doors, Electrical fixtures
1.	All plumbing fixtures will be taken to Habitat for Humanity. Estimated weight of materials will be documented. 
vi.	Concrete and Masonry Materials 
1.	All material of this type appears to be contaminated due to the presence of paint. As a result, all of this material must be taken to a state permitted solid waste C&D landfill per IDEM Guidance Sheet 329 IAC 10-2-37. Given this IDEM requirement, this contaminated material is not eligible for recycling and therefore cannot be taken into account in the landfill diversion requirements as called for in the project specifications 011510. All concrete and masonry materials will be separated and put into a specific dumpster and taken to C&D landfill. . At time of delivery, the load will be weighed and tickets will be documented.

This includes waste generated by small construction and renovation projects and waste from major capital improvement building projects. 

On small construction and renovation projects, UCI actively collects all C&D materials generated using 20 cubic yard lowboy containers and 40 cubic yard bins at the job site.  A system of source separation is used for concrete, asphalt and metals. For mixed construction debris all material is taken to a transfer station with a C&D material recovery facility (MRF) that provides an average diversion rate of 70-75% for C&D material.  

In addition, campus renovation and maintenance projects are provided use of 40-yard metal collection bins for the recycling of all metal from renovation and plumbing jobs to ensure that all C&D jobs have free and easy access to source separation and collection of this material. For the collection and recycling of all other C&D jobs on campus, UC Irvine works in partnership with a local vendor that provides C&D MRF services to on-campus contractors at a low cost and a guaranteed a diversion rate of 70% or higher, ensuring that all contractors working on campus have a cost-effective means of recycling construction waste at these high diversion rates.   

All major capital improvement construction projects on campus divert a minimum of 75% of construction and demolition waste as part of UC Irvine’s campuswide green building program. UCI projects are required to meet a minimum level of LEED Silver certification and compliance includes a LEED Credit requirement to divert a minimum of 75% of construction and demolition waste. LEED accredited construction staff monitor C&D waste generation and recovery and maintain documentation to confirm waste diversion compliance.

UCI uses Hot In-Place Asphalt replacement program instead of the traditional asphalt removal and replacement. In 2014/15 we used this process to resurface 599,440 cubic feet of asphalt.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf88DU3omfg ) With specialized equipment we are able to use the existing asphalt by melting the damaged asphalt and resurfacing the road.

As a standard requirement of UCLA construction contracts, each project must compose and implement a Construction Waste Management Plan. Prior to demolition, any reusable and salvageable items or materials are separated by Departments and either reallocated inside the University or sold or donated.  Any remaining large reuse or salvage is then removed by demolition contractors. Any in place hazardous materials that may be present are separately abated and safely removed. For subsequent demolition and construction waste, Contractors typically engage waste-diversion companies that separate recyclables off-site. On-site staging space is frequently quite limited and these companies offer high rates of reclamation that are independently-certified by Los Angeles County or other regulating authorities. Projects are required to report waste diversion at least quarterly, though many provide monthly data. Overall project waste diversion reports and data are independently reviewed by the Green Building Certification Institute.

Paul College of Business and Economics University of New Hampshire Construction Waste Management Plan
PC Construction Company (PCC) is committed to the following Construction Waste Management Plan as a means to ensure that a minimal amount of waste debris is disposed of in a landfill, and that all the LEED requirements for Construction Waste Management MR Credit 2.1 and 2.2 are met. PCC is responsible for the overall implementation and assurance that the standards of this plan are met; however, it cannot be done without the full cooperation of every subcontractor and tradesperson involved in the Paul College Construction Project.
Scope:
PC Construction will adhere to the LEED credit MR 2.1 and 2.2 requirements for Construction Waste Management, and will provide the following:
• Documentation that at least 75% of all waste generated during the construction phase of this project was diverted from a landfill, and recycled.
• Waste reduction calculations for end of project recycling rates, salvage rates, and landfill rates demonstrating that at least 75% of the construction waste is recycled or salvaged.
• LEED letter template for credits MR 2.1 and 2.2 in accordance with USGBC requirements signed by PCC.
PC Construction will be responsible for the Construction Waste Management Plan (CWMP) in conjunction with its subcontractors. All subcontractors shall comply with the CWMP as it applies to each trade. PC will track the subs conformance to this plan at our weekly subcontractor meetings. All superintendents and/or foreman will provide training to their employees to ensure procedures are followed. PC Construction will provide separate containers for the following debris:
• Wood
• Metals
• Cardboard
• General Debris
• Concrete, Masonry, & Asphalt
• Sheetrock
Each worker on the project site will be responsible for disposing of waste materials in the proper container. All containers will be clearly marked for proper materials. PC Construction will monitor containers to ensure materials are being discarded in the proper containers.
Waste Management will provide tracking documentation to PC Construction after each dumpster has been switched out. A monthly summary will be provided to PCC and will be available for review by all members of the project team.
131 Presumpscot Street, Portland, ME 04103 207.874.2323 www.pizzagalli.com
￼￼
Implementation:
PC Construction Company has contracted with Waste Management to provide waste disposal services. The construction debris produced from the Paul College project will be hauled to the following locations and.
• Wood – Turnkey Recycling Facility Rochester, NH or ERRCO Epping, NH
• Metals – New England Metal Recycling Madbury, NH
• Cardboard : Turnkey Recycling Facility Rochester, NH
• General Debris (comingled) : Turnkey Recycling Facility Rochester, NH
• Concrete, Masonry, & Asphalt : Turnkey Recycling Facility Rochester, NH or ERRCO
Epping, NH
• Sheetrock – Georgia Pacific Newington, NH
Waste Management will submit monthly tracking logs detailing weight percentages of each type of waste. A copy of the manifest for each dumpster dumped will also be submitted to PC Construction each time a dumpster leaves the jobsite. We will also be one of the first construction companies to use their automated online system that posts all of the weight tickets to a server for access.
Waste Management will provide containers to recycle waste wood, metal, cardboard, concrete, sheetrock, and general debris. Waste Management will provide containers that will properly protect waste material that needs to be protected from the weather in order to be recycled. Waste Management will also provide a general debris dumpster that will be used for disposing non:recyclable items such as food waste, plastics, insulation, and other items.
It is estimated that this project could generate 850 tons of waste debris with at least 75% of this material being recycled to a certified recycling facility. A final accounting of this material, along with all material for the project will be submitted to the Architect, in the final (CWMP) report.
Appendix # 1 documents all materials to be recycled, and end use of these recycled materials.
Quality Assurance
PC Construction will have the responsibility to oversee the waste management plan. PCC personal will regularly review site conditions and review waste containers to ensure proper materials are discarded in proper locations. Corrective actions will be taken for any non:conformance.
UNH, Goody Clancy, or any members of the project team can review containers to ensure compliance. Weight slips and records from Waste Management will be kept of all containers that leave the site.
Subcontractors will have the responsibility to ensure they are following the (CWMP), and are the first line of quality control. Subcontractors will have the responsibility to ensure their crews are properly trained on the plan and disposing of waste properly.
￼Paul College of Business and Economics University of New Hampshire Construction Waste Management Plan
Appendix #1 – End Use of Recycled Materials
• Clean Wood is separated for recycling (chipped, burned for fuel, or turned to mulch), and what cannot be reused is brought to a certified landfill.
• Metals are sorted and sold to various metal recycling facilities.
• Cardboard will be shredded for use as mulch, or burned as fuel.

However, on a recent project (Davison House remodel, not a LEED building) we did require the general contractor to recycle as much waste as possible. They sorted and separated all debris, which was recycled by the hauler. We did not require documentation identifying the actual quantities. If the administration agrees to a LEED project we are obligated to track waste. Our contractors do use local carting companies that do recycle out of general practice. So they are sorting materials in dumpsters and the carting companies are performing their own recovery."
