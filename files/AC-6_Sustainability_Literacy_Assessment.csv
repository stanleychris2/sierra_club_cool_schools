The student work includes the following assignments where students have to demonstrate a level of understanding of sustainability, sense of place and ecological literacy and explore their own ecological perspective.  

-Academic Essay #1 – Sense of Place, students focus on one of three essay prompts exploring their sense of place in preparation for longer research essay.
-Academic Essay # 2 – Research Essay, students choose one of three essay prompts.
-Academic Essay #3 – Service-Learning Reflection.
-University Colloquium Journal – Guided entries.
-Final Service-Learning Project, and Presentation 
-Class Participation through discussions, activities, worksheets, group project and quizzes.","The University Colloquium is an interdisciplinary environmental education course designed to explore the concept of sustainability as it relates to a variety of considerations and forces in the environment. In particular, we  consider ecological, social, ethical, historical, scientific, economic, and political influences. The course has been a graduate requirement of all undergraduate students since we opened our doors in 1997.  Faculty have carefully reviewed and developed the curriculum to include a comprehensive experience for students.  

The course goals are:

• To provide a ""sense of place"" and an understanding of the unique ecological features of the environment of which you are a part.
• To assist in developing an ecological perspective and a commitment to community awareness and involvement in order for students to know the issues related to economic, social, and ecological sustainability, analyze and evaluate ecological issues locally and globally, participate in projects requiring awareness and/or analysis of ecological and environmental issues;
• To provide experiences to assist in moving toward the university learning goals of effective communication skills and critical thinking skills as well as the university’s stated mission of practicing and promoting environmental sustainability and encouraging civic responsibility”;
• To enable a practical understanding of sustainability, of environmental education, and of ecological literacy.

Student Learning Outcomes
Students are expected to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of environmental issues through writing and class participation.
2. Critically analyze environmental issues from economic, social, political, and ecological perspectives.
3. Describe the unique ecological features of the area and analyze Southwest Florida’s unique environmental and ecological challenges.
4. Demonstrate a practical understanding of sustainability, sense of place, and ecological literacy.","Students are enrolled in the University Colloquium course during their senior or junior years.  It is a requirement of all undergraduate students as a university requirement.  Assessment for the sustainability literacy occurs through their participation in interactive discussions, writing competencies, service-learning project and final course assessments.  
We looked at student work for the past three academic years (2011-2014 Fall and Spring) for University Colloquium.  Since all undergraduate majors take University Colloquium, we have looked at data for these sections which are a representative sample of majors from across the colleges.  We have decided to only look at data from during the Fall and Spring semesters even though just as many students take the course in the summer.  Through analysis we determined if students exceeded, met or did not meet parameters determined by the student learning outcomes listed above. ","On average about 80% of students exceeded outcomes for the past three years.  Sustainability is key to our mission and this signature course provides a valuable experience for students to fully understand the different elements of sustainability and their own ecological perspective.  Following is the breakdown for the past semesters.  

Fall 2011 - 10,107 total enrolled; 824 University Colloquium Students; 80.95% Exceeded Outcomes; 5.7% Met outcomes; 13.35 % Did Not Meet Outcomes.
Spring 2012 - 8,635 total enrolled; 846 University Colloquium Students; 77.3% Exceeded Outcomes; 6.74% Met outcomes; 15.96% Did Not Meet Outcomes.

Fall 2012 - 10797 total enrolled; 890 University Colloquium Students; 81.24% Exceeded Outcomes; 7.3% Met Outcomes; 11.46% Did Not Meet Outcomes.

Environmental Science seniors also surveyed seniors for 3 years. This survey was voluntary. ,"Juniata College has been administering an environmental attitudes survey to incoming freshmen since 2005.  The objective of the survey is to document students’ attitudes and behaviors towards environmental issues.   Evaluating such concepts of sustainability contributes to the school’s mission to be an environmentally responsible academic intuition.   The survey is divided into four sections – the new environmental paradigm, which addresses broad issues on ecology and the environment; transportation related issues; attitudes and behaviors towards recycling; and attitudes and behaviors related to consumption.  We found gender differences in attitudes, where males appear to be less environmentally minded than females.  This year the survey was also administered to exiting seniors.  We also found an encouraging trend - the attitudes of graduating seniors were significantly more environmentally friendly than those of the incoming freshmen.  Seniors felt that the “ecological crisis” that we face is real, and that there are serious resource limitations that we need to address.  Differences in behavior were not as apparent between the two groups.   Seniors were more resistant to capping the number of cars allowed on campus (Kruskal-Wallis P-value:0.029), freshmen were less likely to remember to recycle (Kruskal-Wallis P-value = 0.05).  Overall, our results indicate that the Juniata College experience leads to environmentally responsible citizens.  ",--,--

","The questions in the assessment survey were compiled by reviewing similar surveys conducted by other higher education institutions, and customizing them to SRU campus-specific issues.","The University uses an electronic survey firm (overseen by the SRU Institutional Research Office) to conduct blind surveys of students .SRU’s Public Relations Department sent out mass emails to all students several times during the roughly two week time slot allocated for this survey. 

Note that a follow-up sustainability survey was not undertaken due to administration concerns over ""student survey fatigue""; instead, several sustainability questions are now included in the annual Student Government Association general survey of students.","A voluntary survey of the entire student population conducted by the Office of Sustainability, “Assessing Student Attitudes Toward Sustainability”, was first conducted from 2/25/2013 through 3/19/2013. Total respondents were 327 (327/8,182 = 4% of total student population), and were fairly well distributed among student classifications (19% freshman, 19% sophomores, 27% juniors, 24% seniors, and 11% graduate students). 27% of respondents were from the College of Business, Information and Social Sciences, 18% from the College of education, 46% from the College of Health, Environment and Science, and 9% from the College of Humanities, Fine & Performing Arts. 35% were male and 65% were female, with the respondents split between on-campus (41%) and off-campus (59%).

The issue of ""Climate Change"" was rated by students to be less important than the economy and healthcare but more important than both poverty and the Afghanistan war. Respondents were generally quite aware of climate change issues and the scientific basis behind it as 82% said that it is important for the U.S. to save energy, with 79% agreeing it reduces GHG emissions. Of all the students participating, 48% thought global climate change will be a major problem in their lifetime; 46% thought it would be a minor problem, while 76% thought global climate change will be a major problem for their children or grandchildren.

In order provide the best projects for the new year we needed to assess the Laurier community to see where they saw most improvement needed. By asking questions that pertained to campus involvement, sustainable expertise and personal opinion we were able to gauge how the respondent viewed Laurier’s current sustainable status, where they saw weaknesses and their ideas going forward. Respondents gave great answers that helped our committee pinpoint areas of needed attention. We are now able to use these results to create a project plan that encompasses not only our sustainability needs but our school community’s needs as well.","The assessment was made using the SurveyMonkey website. Staff, students and faculty were sent a link via an inter campus email. From there respondents were directed to the online survey and were able to provide their responses.
