","This survey was developed by a small committee of experts at ASU. The committee reviewed other similar surveys from across the country, primarily Ohio State's, and compiled the survey to best serve ASU's goals.","Survey Period:  January 12, 2016 – February 7, 2016

Surveys distributed: 40,011
Total number of completed surveys: 5,180
Response Percentage: 12.9%
The survey was distributed to 40,011 students at the beginning of the survey period, with one reminder being sent to those who had not yet replied approximately halfway through the survey period. During this time, 6,412 surveys were started, with 5,180 of those being completed and submitted. The analysis was limited to only those 5,180 surveys which were completed.

Historically, freshmen and sophomores have not responded to surveys as much as other groups. For this reason, the freshmen and sophomores were over-sampled to increase their response rates and improve their representation in the results.

The actual responses to each question were weighted to make them reflect the 2016 population for each academic level.  The 2015 responses were also weighted to allow for accurate comparison.","The following bullet points outline key points that were identified in the data that was collected.

•	The majority of respondents (63%) indicated they have considerable interest in or a passion for sustainability. In looking at the academic level of respondents, the percentage of students who said they have an interest in sustainability increased  each year from freshmen up through graduate-level students.
•	Interest in sustainability is evenly divided along gender lines, with a similar percentage of male and female respondents saying they have considerable interest in or a passion for sustainability. Interest tends to increase as academic level increases.
•	As a group, respondents indicated that the top three sustainability issues they place the most importance on are 1) water conservation, 2) recycling and 3) energy conservation. There were some differences when the question was stratified by gender, academic level and college affiliation; however these were small variations in ranking the issues. For most groups, water conservation and recycling were the top issues (with a few variations in some groups).
•	In looking at the questions which were used to test the respondents’ knowledge of sustainability issues, when stratified by academic level, the percentage of correct answers generally increased from freshman to graduate-level students for all questions. For some questions, the percentage of graduate students who answered the questions correctly dropped-off a bit in relationship to the seniors.",--,--

After review of other college's assessments, the steering committee decided that it wanted Beloit Students to not only know national issues, but also to understand local and regional issues, as many of our students are from all around the U.S. and internationally as well.  During the spring 2015 semester the steering committee thoughtfully crafted questions that would help the college identify areas of improvement as far as sustainability content in the classroom and in extra-curricular activities and work opportunities within the sustainability department.","The Beloit College Sustainability Literacy Assessment was administered anonymously through SurveyMonkey, an online survey tool.  Student Residential Assistants agreed to promote the survey during their floor meetings and house meetings.  We also promoted the survey in the dining locations on campus, as well as through student email.","Results of the survey found that, generally, seniors had a richer knowledge of sustainability issues than freshman. There was widespread knowledge of what can and cannot be recycled, with less knowledge about ballpark figures on the college's impact in regards to energy, water, and trash.  Science majors had better knowledge of threats to local waterways.  Knowledge and perception of food issues was equally distributed between the four classes of students.
Some of the answers have sparked additional questions from the steering committee.  These additional questions will be addressed during the spring of 2016 in the form of student focus groups to understand the answers in a deeper way.  Most of the additional questions deal with social sustainability, for example: why is involvement in sustainability perceived to be from white female students, and how can we attract a more diverse students into sustainability initiatives?  Another question revolves around student activity levels--why do students not prioritize their health through regular exercise?  The Sustainability Steering Committee intends to conduct this literacy survey every year for the foreseeable future in the fall semester just for freshman, and then each spring semester for the larger student body.",--,--

Over the three years, the project resulted in innovative modules or full courses that introduced concepts central to environmental literacy and built a learning community of the project faculty. A total of 35 courses were affected, and the environmental material developed has been integrated permanently to the content of courses ranging from Writing and History to Art and Design to Architecture and Engineering. This innovation continues to touch over 300 students each semester. Three overarching features were embedded into the courses as foundations for ecological thinking: systems thinking, life cycles, and self as agent.","Environmental literacy is a way of thinking as much as it is knowledge of facts and methods. Seeking to capture how students think about and understand environmental issues, the project tried an interview protocol, in which students verbally discussed an environmental case study with a moderator. From these interviews, the researchers devised an essay question based on a case study to illuminate students’ additional thought processes.","The assessment strengthened the faculty’s understanding of the challenges of teaching for environmental literacy.  The following outcomes were noted in the final report to the Luce Foundation:

•	Creation of a Learning Community
•	A Learning Experience for Faculty—Improved pedagogy through a sharing of ideas and methods
•	Systematic Assessment of Learning Objectives
•	Scholarship of Teaching and Pedagogy: Teaching for Environmental Literacy
•	Definition of Environmental Literacy: We documented our process of defining, teaching, evaluating performance, and assessing the learning of environmental literacy and how to measure the impact of a specific course.

","We administer three surveys which assess sustainability literacy at  CWRU: The Freshman Survey (TFS), the Your First College Year (YFCY), and the College Senior Survey (CSS). The surveys are administered on a three-year cycle, so the same cohort of students would be administered all three of the surveys. The TFS and YFCY are administered to all first-time, first year students who enrolled in a particular year, with the TFS occurring before fall term and the YFCY occurring at the end of the spring term. The CSS (also administered at the end of the spring term) is administered to all students who have senior status, the bulk of which would have filled out the TFS and YFCY term. This way, we not only have baseline data, but also follow-up data after one year and four. In addition to the standard items on the survey that deal with sustainability, CWRU has customized the survey to include eight additional sustainability literacy items questions across the three surveys.","This past year was the first that we were able to assess the fourth year students who were also assessed as first years. Of the eight questions used to assess sustainability literacy above, six of the questions saw improvement of correct answers in both the second assessment (YFCY) at the end of the first year as well a the fourth year (CSS).

It was a highly complex and time-consuming survey because it attempted to establish priorities for campus sustainability while also assessing knowledge, perceptions and behaviors on sustainability. it was given over a 3 week period during the academic year, and highly advertised in all schools. It was a highly representative sample of our students and faculty across schools/disciplines.","This was a very complex survey instrument that led to a rather complex assessment of sustainability knowledge. While behaviors, perceptions and values were tested, the primary questions attempted to discern not only the knowledge of sustainability (based on how it was defined) but how ""sustainability"" knowledge was constructed. The primary finding, which is now a peer-reviewed publication, was that the vast majority of students had a fragmented understanding of sustainability. That is, it was not holistic. Moreover, we found a strong correlation with the varying schools on campus and how students then constructed their definition (i.e. physical science students oriented around ecological aspects of sustainability, while business students showed a very high correlation to eco-efficiency, and social science and humanities students had a strong correlation to social, participatory and justice aspects of sustainability). What was alarming that each school, in particularly business students, show a strong negative correlation to other aspects of sustainability -- for them it was the social side. Meaning a large percentage of students not only recognized eco-efficiency but they did so at the expense of social aspects. We called this disciplinary fragmentation of sustainability. We also tested definitional aspects of sustainability (write one sentence or word that describes sustainability), and the results were as suspected, fragmented and usually focused on recycling or ""thinking about future gens"". We also had other questions around the role of sustainability and futures thinking. ",--,--

Participation was voluntary. ","After a review of all data collected throughout the Human Behavior Energy AuditSM (HBEA) investigation, ECTBC identified seven key findings which, if addressed, would position Columbia to take immediate steps towards reaching their environmental and sustainability goals while enhancing a culture of energy-efficiency. These findings are followed by a set of general recommendations that are open to interpretation and discussion. 

Finding 1: The perceptions of existing conservation efforts of Columbia Faculty/Staff and Residential Students are low: this is associated with low participation rates, resulting in a diminished campus energy conservation culture.
Finding 2: Survey respondents across both groups demonstrated a similar degree of misunderstanding about screen savers, vehicle idling and fan usage. 
Finding 3: Faculty/Staff and Residential Students reported moderate levels of personal responsibility with respect to energy conservation on campus. 
Finding 4: The HBEA results identified immediate opportunities to engage Sustainable Behavior Change practices in order to reduce energy consumption and produce savings. 
Finding 5: A majority (63-94%) of both groups reported that they would voluntarily change specific behaviors if Columbia accommodated them with an energy efficient alternative.
Finding 6: Residential Students reported that 1 out of 4 light bulbs brought onto campus are energy wasting incandescent bulbs.  Faculty/Staff were worse, with one of 3 bulbs they brought onto campus being incandescent.  Extrapolating from the HBEA survey results, for Residential Students alone, over one million kilowatt hours are consumed annually on Columbia's campus.  
Finding 7: The issue of recycling consistently came up amongst faculty, staff and students.  While recycling behaviors amongst faculty/staff are slightly higher than those of students, opportunities exist to improve the recycling experience.  ECTBC recommends an audit of campus recycling followed by a consensus approach.

Beginning in Fall 2012, GW assesses the sustainability literacy of undergraduate students through the use of a pre-test and post-test concept map.  All Sustainability 1001 students are surveyed at the start of the semester, then again at the end of the term, to assess how well they have mastered important terms, concepts, and processes in sustainability.  The class is taught each semester, so data has been gathered on sustainability literacy for hundreds of GW undergraduates.  ","Improvements in knowledge are clearly seen in the post-test, particularly in improved understanding of the interdisciplinary nature and complexity of sustainability problems and solutions.  However, using a concept mapping tool is complicated and makes quantitative assessments difficult.  One way we use this assessment is to provide qualitative feedback to the sustainability faculty to help them better understand instructional needs.   ",--,"We believe this is a good sampling procedure.  First, this class is geared toward freshmen and the pre-test helps us understand how much they know about sustainability coming into the university so that we can well calibrate instruction.  This course does not typically have declared Sustainability Minors, but freshman students who have not declared their majors or minors.  Many of the students have no previous understanding of sustainability.  For this reason we consider that this assessment is conducted on a broad student audience.  

Second, this class has a diverse range of students that actually reflects the members of the undergraduate population.  The class enrollment is 100 students, and the breakdown of students by schools matches the wider school-based distribution for all undergraduates (for example, 70% of students in the Sustainability 1001 class are in Columbian College, 12% are in Elliot School of International Affairs, 8% are in the School of Business and so on).  For this reason we consider the assessment to be of a representative sample of the GW undergraduate population.  

Third, by testing literacy within a course, we are able to assess what and how well students learn over the course of the semester, something we feel is valuable to enhancing the curriculum.

Instead, students are assessed wholistically by the faculty on their ongoing progress in meeting the learning outcomes of the undergraduate Environmental Liberal Arts Curriculum and the respective graduate program learning outcomes. 

The ELA Learning Outcomes can be located at: http://www.greenmtn.edu/academics/environmental-liberal-arts-program/ela-goals/ 

The Graduate program learning outcomes can be located at: 
http://www.greenmtn.edu/flipbooks/Green_Mountain_College_Graduate_Catalog_2015-16/index.html#1/z ","Green Mountain College assesses knowledge of sustainability topics,  through comprehensive assessments of the general education learning outcomes for the Environmental Liberal Arts core curriculum program (ELA), which all degree-seeking undergraduates participate in. This assessment system was originally initiated in fall 2008 with the help of a grant from the Davis Educational Foundation and has since been revised by the faculty.

Graduate students in the MSFS, MSRC, and MBA programs are assessed for learning outcomes in sustainability as part of their normal program assessment. These assessment mechanisms were developed by the faculty committees that created the programs.
","Any particular ELA class is meant to meet 4-5 of the overall ELA goals linked above. Depending on the instructor and class format, students are assessed on the ELA goals through papers, projects, writing and exams. 

A comprehensive review of the assessment of the ELA learning outcomes is done by faculty in a four-year cycle. . In each core course, they collect (using Moodle) a random sample of 30 papers/projects/exams and a small team of 2-3 faculty evaluates how students did on one or two goals each year as part of a four-year cycle. The faculty team develops a rubric that fits the particular goal(s), assesses the work, and generates a report. The report includes suggestions for improvement based on the data, and these suggestions are considered at the annual faculty workshop, as faculty discuss different strategies for improving particular courses. 

For distribution courses, the process is similar, though it is more of a snapshot of a particular semester’s offerings. This can be done in either semester, and the team is made up of faculty who regularly teach in that area of the distribution, but not necessarily in the same semester as the assessment. As with the core, the four-year assessment cycle requires that one goal is examined per year. After four years, each core course and distribution area gets assessed and then faculty report on all the goals. At the end of this period, a record of the percentage of graduates who meet these competencies is also available.

Students are also given a writing assignment to synthesize their reflections on what they have learned during their time at GMC, especially in the ELA program and to envision how the skills and knowledge they’ve gained will enable them to meet their goals during the next ten years. For the assignment, students are asked to answer the following questions:
1. What are the local and global issues that you hope to address now and in the future? Think about specific environmental, social, and political issues that are meaningful to you. (Since reflection is best done with information, you’re expected to show research with cited sources).
2. What skills, knowledge, and character traits have you acquired that are important to your sense of what contributions you can make to your (local, national, or global) community? Reflect here about your ELA and other relevant educational experience thus far. Be specific. Keep the ELA-Delicate Balance goals in mind.
3. What skills, knowledge, and character traits do you still need to acquire in order to engage with the issues above? How will you achieve these?

Graduate students in the MSFS, MSES and MBA programs are assessed for sustainability knowledge by their respective program directors who go through and look at portfolio and capstone work and write up to what extent students meet the learning outcomes affiliated with their sustainability-focused degrees.
","The assessment of the ELA Learning Outcomes have provided the following results:
 
Learning Outcome I.1 Students will demonstrate knowledge of social systems and their historical development.  62% of students met or exceeded the standard and 29% of students approached the standard.
 
Learning Outcome I.2 Students will demonstrate knowledge of ecological systems and how they have been historically conceived. 14% of students met or exceeded the standard and 58% of students approached the standard.

Learning Outcome III.1 Students will contemporary environmental issues such as climate change, resource depletion and biodiversity loss as well as the complexity of proposed solutions. 50% of students  met or exceeded the standard and 34% of students  approached the standard.

Learning Outcome III.2 Students will understand the history of land use and the changing relationship between humans and nature over time. 79% of students met or exceeded the standard and 21% of students approached the standard.

Sixty total students met the sustainability knowledge based learning outcomes for the graduate programs during the 2014-2015 academic year and were conferred their graduate degrees in May, 2015. ",http://www.greenmtn.edu/academics/environmental-liberal-arts-program/ela-goals/,"The performance year is FY 2015. The headcount for students involved with all programs captured in this credit was conducted in the fall of 2014. 

All undergraduates are formally assessed for sustainability literacy as they  progress through the required Environmental Liberal Arts Curriculum. The assessments measure students demonstrated achievement of the learning outcomes through an on-going representative sample described below. 

The three graduate programs(MBA, MSES and MSFS)  are assessed annually for sustainability as part of the assessment of their sustainability learning outcomes associated with their programs. Similar to the undergraduate program, these assessments measure graduates demonstrated achievement of the learning outcomes.

With the help of an undergraduate research assistant, Lewis queried the literature and internet to find examples of sustainability literacy surveys. From these, Lewis and the research assistant compiled a list of possible questions and then circulated to the SLLC faculty as well as the HWS Sustainability Manager. Following their feedback, the sustainability literacy survey instrument was finalized and submitted to the HWS Institutional Review Board for review and approval.","Surveys were administered during the first month of the fall 2014 semester. Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Robin Lewis and other members of her research team, which included undergraduate students and staff, visited the first-year seminars of those faculty members who agreed to host them. After reading a brief disclaimer statement that explained the project as well as the roles and responsibilities of study participants, researchers provided first-year students with a paper copy of the sustainability literacy to complete over a period of 10 to 15 minutes. Once students were done, the researchers collected the completed survey instruments and returned them to Lewis for data entry.
A follow-up (post) survey was administered using an online survey tool (Baseline/Campus Labs) in May 2015. The survey link was emailed to all first-year students (n=636), of which only .02% (n=12) completed the post survey.","With regard to the level of familiarity with sustainability terminology, first-year students varied greatly in answering questions correctly. Students correctly answered questions about what it means to eat seasonally (88.3%), the definition of a carbon footprint (84.4%), and the relationship between sustainability and natural resources (70.7%) at the highest frequencies. Meanwhile, first-year students were less familiar with the basics of greenhouse gases (24.2%), water footprints of various foods (22.9%), and the definition of ecosystem services (22.2%) with less than a quarter of these students answering these questions correctly.

First-year students were also asked to rate their level of concern of a range of issues as they pertain to sustainability (1=not concerned at all; 5=very concerned). Of the six direct variables measured, first-year students are most concerned with water use (58.5%) and energy use (52.93%).

","SUSTLIT is a standardized questionnaire designed to assess aptitude in sustainability. The questionnaire measures knowledge, attitudes, and behavior about sustainability.  SUSTLIT has both the behavior checklists and an array of attitude questions; but, most of the items assess knowledge.  Sustainability is defined across six dimensions of knowledge:  climate change, energy, planetary assets, systems, environmental, and organizational influences, plus a set of definition questions.  The six knowledge dimensions are assessed with four to eight items.  There are also eleven definition questions, eleven attitude items, and sixteen behavior measures.

All the knowledge items are 5-point Likert scales (strongly disagree-strongly agree).  Likert scales are appropriate for measuring knowledge when there is not an objectively clear right or wrong response.  Statements on SUSTLIT are worded such that about half reflected correct understanding of sustainability and half incorrect.  Reported scores, therefore, were recoded such that higher numbers reflected more correct responses--stronger agreement indicating higher sustainability literacy.
","In August of 2013 Seattle University assessed the sustainability literacy of incoming freshman.  The class of 975 new students were invited to complete the SUSTLIT survey on-line.  SUSTLIT is a standardized questionnaire designed to assess aptitude in sustainability. The scale was developed and its psychometric properties assessed, using SU students.   Results from that development process are available; but, because they were not intended to be a targeted sample, they do not necessarily represent any specific group at Seattle University.  This data collection was, therefore, intended to be the benchmark in a series of annual surveys of incoming freshman, to be supplemented with periodic assessments of graduating seniors. The survey was given to incoming freshmen at the start of the 2014 and 2015 fall quarters. The first post-test will be given to graduating seniors in May 2017.","Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior Subscale Means*

Participation was optional. Only 10% of the total population responded to the form. A sample of students from different majors and degree levels was requested to answer this emailed survey. This survey was then analyzed to understand the student community's future needs and to discuss future Literary Assessment procedures.,"The results of the first Literacy Assessment conducted on Campus showed that 80% of students always recycle, but that only 20% use their own reusable water bottle on campus (many used more that 16+ bottles of water a week). Of the Freshman surveyed, approximately 50% did not know of the new water bottle filling stations on campus. Of all students surveyed, 51% said that they ""try to buy locally grown or organic"" whenever possible, 55% did not know of the organic garden on campus (mostly Freshman/Sophomores), approximately 61% print both on and off campus, and find that their is a presence of sustainability on campus.  What was interesting to find was that only 30% of all those surveyed recognized that there are three components to sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) with the other 70% only identifying the environmental aspect. Another interesting aspect of the assessment was the behaviors ""rarely or never"" performed.  The top two behaviors not instrumented were biking for transportation and unplugging devices when not in use.  

Our findings opened areas for future improvement and ideas to engage students in areas that are lacking.  We hope to use this survey to better inform our students and work on further sustainable practices on campus.

Results of the Literacy Assessment sent shows great variety among dorming/commuter students, variation in type of school, but of those students who responded to the survey approximately 75% were female and only 25% were male.  There was also a great number of students from the ""North America"" area, and few from places abroad.  These results do not represent the great diversity on campus, but is a starting point for the Sustainability Department to evaluate their work on campus.  A more in depth Literacy Assessment will be discussed for next year.",--,*A small sample size of the total campus population was analyzed due to the percent of students who responded to an optional survey.
Stanford University,2016-03-23,2016-03-23 01:14:04,mbhafer@stanford.edu,2.0,Pursuing,--,70.0,,"Residential and Dining Enterprises (R&DE), which includes Student Housing and Stanford Dining, surveys both students in the dorms and on the meal plans. 
 
R&DE included the following question that draws upon students’ knowledge of sustainability topics in its annual student housing survey:
“R&DE Student Housing is looking to enhance sustainability and conservation efforts. What opportunities do you think exist for Housing as a whole and/or within your specific community, and what programs would you like to see offered?”

Additionally, R&DE included the following sustainability questions in the annual meal plan survey. To better serve the purposes of R&DE, these questions focus more heavily on students’ values regarding sustainable food. While these questions do not capture data on students’ sustainability knowledge, they do compliment the question included in the Student Housing survey to provide R&DE
with valuable information on both students’ sustainability knowledge and their core values and behaviors.

Value-based questions from R&DE:
(A) Using a scale of 1 - 4, where 4 is most important, please rate the importance to you of the following:
 (1) eating food that is locally grown or raised
(2) composting your food scraps
(3) eating grass-fed or pasture-raised meat
(4) eating a more plant-based diet
(5) eating food that is grown or raised on small family farms
(6) eating humanely raised meat, eggs, and dairy products
(7) ""fairly traded"" products

(B) The following six questions will ask you to rate the importance of various characteristics of the food you eat. Using a scale of 1 - 4,where 4 is most important, please rate the importance to you of the following:
(1) taste and aroma
(2) speed and convenience
(3) appearance
(4) environmental impact
(5) social impact
(6) familiarity

(C) The following five questions will ask you to rate how important various issues are to you, compared to other things in your life. Using a scale of 1 - 4, where 4 is most important, compared to other things in your life, how important is:
(1) eating a healthful diet
(2) staying physically fit
(3) environmental sustainability
(4) animal rights
(5) social justice

Additionally, four questions are asked about protein sources. 
The first asks about whether students feel they are getting enough protein, as we have found that students often feel they need more protein (especially animal protein) than is necessary. This is based off of research from Stanford professor and R&DE partner, Christopher Gardener. The second question asks where they get most of their protein sources (red meat, chicken, fish/seafood, dairy products, eggs, beans/legumes/or other). The third question asks which has more protein- red meat, chicken or the same. The final question asks students if they like fish (a sustainable protein source that has not always been popular with students). 
"," Sustainability is a core value of R&DE and a campus priority, which is why these questions are included in the R&DE surveys. The question in the student housing survey was developed with the intention of utilizing students’ knowledge of sustainability topics to enhance R&DE’s programs. The questions in the student dining surveys were primarily developed to gain a better understanding of the value students place on sustainable food in order to inform the actions of the Stanford Dining Sustainable Food Program. They were developed using industry benchmarks including AASHE, Menus of Change, and Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program. ","The R&DE surveys are sent to all students who reside on-campus (graduate and undergraduate -- 70% of the enrolled student body) plus all students (undergraduate and graduate) who are on the meal plan. Both the housing and dining questions were administered electronically via online surveys. Between the two surveys, almost all students on campus are covered. 
","The surveys were analyzed by R&DE staff to identify opportunities for program improvement and other trends in student sustainability preferences. Major themes that emerged can be characterized as follows:
-	24% of responses mentioned that convenience enhances/facilitates adoption of sustainable behaviors
-	23% of students consider themselves self-motivated with respect to sustainability
-	Composting was frequently mentioned as a priority and personally important, and the new composting program in graduate housing was mentioned explicitly.

For the Dining survey, the findings are used to change menus and to create targeted education campaigns with the Performance Dining nutritionist, chefs, and Sustainable Food Program Manager: 
-	From most highly rated food labels to least: Humanely-raised, composting, fair trade, grass-fed, family farms, plant-based, and locally-grown.
-	From most highly rated lifestyle values to least: healthful diet, physical fitness, environmental sustainability, social justice, and animal rights.

As a baseline evaluation the assessment tool continues to be refined, improved, and pared down.  The most recent list of items has been reduced to 28 questions using an Item Response Theory (IRT) method.","The literacy assessment surveyed a representative sample of students through an online survey.  Approximately 4,400 students responded to the survey. The survey measured knowledge of sustainability concepts, awareness of sustainability driven efforts on campus, energy conservation behavior, and enrollment in sustainability focused courses.  In the latest survey we also included items from the Theory of Planned Behavior, a socio-psychological theory that explains whether individuals decide to engage in specific behaviors.  Our goal for this survey was to examine how sustainability knowledge may fit into the Theory of Planned Behavior to explain conservation behaviors.  ","The following is from a forthcoming publication reporting the results of the latest (2014) survey.  The citation of the publication is:

Heeren, A., Singh, A., Zwickle, A., Slagle, K., Koontz, T., McCreey, A. (Forthcoming) Is Sustainability Knowledge Half the Battle? An Examination of Sustainability Knowledge, Attitudes, Norms and efficacy to Understand Sustainable Behaviors.  International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education. 

""A common misperception is that unsustainable behaviors are largely driven by a lack of knowledge of the underlying societal costs as well as the contributing factors leading to environmental degradation. Such a perception assumes if individuals “only knew better,” they would engage in more sustainable behaviors. The “Knowledge Deficit Model” has been critiqued for not including social psychological research about how knowledge is incorporated into decision-making and its subsequent effect on human behavior. The Theory of Planned Behavior model has been used extensively to examine intention to engage in a variety of behaviors, therefore this model is applied to examine the effect knowledge has in predicting behavior.  The number of ASK questions a student answered correctly was summed to create an ASK score measuring knowledge.  The minimum score was 0 questions answered correctly and the maximum was 27 questions (out of 30 questions possible) answered correctly.  The average score was 17.02 (SD = 6.214).  The statistic for reliability (α = 0.872) was within an acceptable range (DeVellis, 2012) indicating the variable is appropriate to include in the model.  An ANOVA showed that sustainability knowledge differed based on political party affiliation [F(4,552) = 5.536; p < 0.01].   A t-test indicated that males scored slightly higher than females (mean difference = 1.996; t = -3.82 p < 0.01). Results indicate that knowledge had a significant, albeit weak, bivariate correlation with behavior (r = .113, p < .001). However, when controlling for Theory of Planned Behavior variables (attitudes, norms and perceived behavioral control), knowledge was not a significant predictor of behavior.  This study places sustainable knowledge in the context of other social psychological factors which also influence behavior. The results show that as we educate students about sustainability, fostering behavior change will require education not only about how actions affect sustainability, but also about social norms, attitudes towards sustainable behaviors, and the level of self-efficacy in doing those behaviors.""",--,--

1. Which of the following comes closest to what “sustainability” means to you? Sustainability is about…
- meeting the needs of the present population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
- the shared responsibility for improving the quality of life for all—economically, socially, and environmentally—now and for future generations.
- humans living within the bounds of natural/environmental systems.
- I don't know.

The following assessed participants' knowledge of the relative impacts of various carbon-generating activities: 
4. To what extent do you believe each of the following contributes to Tufts' carbon footprint (amount of greenhouse gases produced)?
- Electricity used in campus buildings
- Commuting to campus by faculty and staff
- Commuting to campus by students
- Air travel paid for by Tufts (e.g. athletics travel, faculty and staff travel)
- Heating campus buildings
- Other 

Questions were also asked to assess students' knowledge of recycling options available to them and other sustainability efforts taking place at Tufts. Additionally, questions about attitudes, values, and behaviors were asked (see attachment). ",This survey was a graduate student project. The student worked for a year developing and testing the questions in focus groups. ,"The survey was administered by sending an email out to all students on all campuses. Students from the Boston and Grafton campuses, as well as the Fletcher School, were surveyed in the Spring of 2011. The rest of the Medford campus (e.g. undergraduate and graduate students from the Arts, Sciences and Engineering schools) was surveyed in the Fall of 2011. The survey was sent to all students. Students were incentivized to respond with a $100 gift certificate. However, they were not required to respond.  ","Question 1: Most students had a reasonable understanding of what sustainability means and how it can be applied to their lives at Tufts.

Question 2: Slightly less than one-third of students said that environmental policies and practices had some importance to their college search.  Over one-third, however, said that they did not consider environmental practices in their college search.

Question 3: For most topics, students were unaware of sustainability practices Tufts has engaged in. Unless they came into contact with those practices regularly, as with lighting motion sensors, organic produce in dining halls, or having an Office of Sustainability, students remained fairly unaware of most sustainability goals and practices at Tufts.

Question 4: Students seem aware of contributions to Tufts’ carbon footprint, but there seems to be confusion as to what contributors add the most to Tufts’ carbon emissions.

Question 5: More than half of the student population is aware that Tufts recycles various forms of electronic waste. Roughly two-thirds of the student population is aware of what can be recycled in the paper, plastic, glass, and metal recycling bins on campus. In only rare cases students stated that an item was not recyclable at Tufts; instead they stated that they were unsure of an item’s recyclability. 

Question 8:  Within seven days of taking the survey: 85.6% of students turned off lights when leaving a room; 85.5% of students recycled; 7.8% turned off the water while brushing their teeth; 76.1% used a reusable beverage container; 70.9% walked or biked instead of using a vehicle; 61.0% used a backpack or reusable bag in lieu of a plastic bag when shopping; 49.2% washed clothes in cold water; 46.2% used the “power-save” settings on their computers; 44.8% unplugged their appliances while not in use; 37.0% bought locally grown or raised food; 34.2% drove a car; 16.3% composted; 14.5% purchased disposable water bottled; 5.8% reported a leak or other utility waste concern.

In addition, we wanted to ask at least one question regarding each of several major sustainability ""systems"" issue areas: waste, climate change, energy, water, food, transportation, social justice, and ecosystems health.  We customized questions in each of these topic areas to relate directly to the systems based in Tucson and southern Arizona, to maximize relevance to our student body.  Finally, we were also using this survey instrument to update our student commuting data for another section of STARS, so quite a number of questions in the survey relate to commuting habits of students.","The assessment was administered online during late November-early December 2015, and polled a representative randomly selected sample of the entire UA in-person student body, including undergraduates and graduate students at the main UA campus in Tucson.  Remote campus populations and online students were not sampled.  The sample size of 1,621 students represented an 18.6% response rate, and was demographically similar to other campus-wide surveys of the entire student body.  The sample is statistically representative of the UA student body.

To encourage a higher response rate, all participants who completed the survey were given the opportunity to win one of five gift cards worth $50 each, winners being randomly selected from those who completed the survey.  This is common practice among campus-wide surveys of this type at UA.
","The major findings of the assessment indicate that UA students have a fairly firm grasp of very basic concepts of sustainability like where their water comes from and what is a renewable energy source.  However, their knowledge breaks down rather quickly as we either ask more abstract questions, or dig deeper into how these systems work, and what people can do to make a difference.

25% partially-correctly indicated ""The recycling and trash stay mixed, and usually are down-cycled into low-value recycled-content products""
39% partially-correctly indicated ""A sorting facility filters out all the trash from the recycling""

Q3 Recent U.S. policy shifts have sought to reduce reliance on what fossil fuel due to its impact on climate change?

","The survey contains four sections that assessed students based on their sustainability familiarity, engagement, knowledge, and demographics. The study used a word generation and word list task plus a modified version of the survey conducted at Ohio State University in conjunction with the University of Maryland. The Word Generation method involved two different questions, each individual participant completed only one of these. The first question was a word generation task (WG) wherein participants provided the five words that they felt best reflected their understanding of the concept ‘sustainability ‘and the second involved a word list task (WL) wherein five words were chosen from a predefined set of terms. The predefined set of terms included 87 terms generated through a review of academic literature regarding definitions of sustainability, and the terms were equitably distributed among the categories of Environmental, Economic, and Social sustainability. The Assessment of Sustainability Knowledge (ASK) survey section consisted of 15 items testing various facets of sustainability knowledge; any USA specific questions were replaced with questions rating participants’ exposure to and familiarity with the concept of sustainability, as well as their motivation to participate and engage in sustainability focused initiatives. This portion of the test was measured according to the number of correct answers. ","92 undergraduate students from the faculties of Arts, Science and the Sauder School of
Business were sampled for this study. The survey was conducted over a 14-day sample period, participants completed surveys at various locations on campus to get a representative sample (including the Student Union Building, Sauder Cafe, and Ponderosa Commons). The study was also hosted on qualtrics.com and circulated online via social media. 
","The difference in word generation and word list tasks suggests that there is a popular perception of environmental sustainability that influences student responses. When asked to list what they thought of the concept sustainability, students were inclined to using environmentally related words whereas when given a list of words to choose from, there was no predominant type of word selection, i.e. environmental, social and economic responses occurred proportionally. 

Year standing and years attended did not correlate with any of the measures and were not significant. Participants in the faculty of Science produced significantly higher mean scores on the sustainability knowledge section than both Arts and Business participants. Though, both number of sustainability-related classes taken and experience with extracurricular sustainability initiatives were found as a significant predictors for participants’ mean knowledge scores.  However, due to a small sample size, further studies are needed on a bigger sample to confirm this data in order to accurately confirm the findings.

In Winter Quarter 2016, the Sustainability Literacy Assessment was modified. Both the 2013 and 2016 assessment surveys are accessible as a combined PDF using the link above.  ","The Sustainability Literacy Assessment has been conducted repeatedly (2013-2016) as part of the Winter Quarter Sustainability I course offered through the UCI School of Social Ecology’s Planning, Policy, and Design Department. The initial assessment survey was developed by Teaching Assistant Sally Geislar, Professor Richard Matthew, and Center for Unconventional Security Affairs (CUSA) researchers, and was administered to Sustainability I students by TAs. The survey was designed to capture changes in eco-literacy, attitudes, values and personal behaviors as a result of participating in the course lectures, projects, extra credit events and coursework. 

The surveys collected both quantitative and qualitative responses from students. Initial survey questions were compiled and developed using a series of existing questions and scales in the Environmental Psychology field, environmental education and polling foundations, and environmental non-profit sources. The section on eco-literacy was based on a 17-question survey, developed by the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation and Roper Public Affairs, intended to measure Americans’ knowledge, behavior and attitudes related to the environment. Questions on attitudes reflect an abbreviated version of the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) developed by Riley Dunlap and William R. Catton Jr. in the 1970s and used widely since then. To capture values related to environmental concern, an abridged version of scales developed by Paul C. Stern was compiled. Finally, to assess personal behaviors related to the environment, questions were collected from Florian Kaiser’s General Ecological Behavior scale as well as the sustainability behavior change program of a non-profit organization called Community Sustainability USA, Inc. 

In Winter Quarter 2016, the assessment was modified to reflect the components of the ASK sustainability assessment. The 2016 assessment focused more on sustainable development literacy than eco-literacy and included a question on awe disposition (because research suggests awe opens people up to new information, i.e., learning), a connectedness to nature scale (because many of the research projects assigned this year have to do with the positive benefits of nature), and changing the eco-literacy EPA assessment to a more holistic sustainable development assessment, which is a better reflection of the course content, and which mimics the assessments done by other universities (i.e. Ohio State and University of Maryland). 


","The first Sustainability Literacy Assessment was administered in Winter Quarter 2013 to the Sustainability I student cohort; follow-up data were collected from the same cohort at the end of the Winter Quarter. Subsequent assessments and follow-ups were similarly conducted in Winter Quarters 2014 and 2015, using the same assessment tool. The Winter Quarter 2016 survey was administered online before the first class of the quarter, and the follow-up survey will be made available at the end of the quarter.  

Using a pre-test, post-test methodology, students completed the pre-test survey before exposure to the treatment; in this case, the Sustainability I course itself is considered the treatment or intervention. To assess change over time, the responses of students who completed the survey prior to the first class were matched and compared to their post-test survey responses. Unfortunately, a control group was not able to be established for comparisons with the treatment group. Students enrolled in the Sustainability I Winter Quarter courses were asked to complete the online survey before attending the first class to capture the baseline eco-literacy/ sustainable development literacy, attitudes, values and personal behaviors prior to exposure to the course (or intervention). Credit was given for completion of both surveys, regardless of response content. Students received the post-survey on the final day of the 10-week course, and had one week to complete the survey for credit. The post-test survey reflects the questions in the pre-test to enable analysis of change over time.  

","Data on the size of the student cohort that participated in the initial administration of the sustainability literacy surveys are available for four surveys: 2013 through 2016. Follow-up assessment data are available only for the 2013 and 2014 surveys. The percentage of students assessed for sustainability literacy and for whom a follow-up assessment was conducted is reported as an average of 2013 and 2014 data: 0.74%. The percentage of students assessed for sustainability literacy without a follow-up assessment is available for 2013-2016 and is reported as an average of the data for the four survey years. 

A brief summary of results from the four assessments (2013 through 2016) is provided below. Analysis of the follow-up assessment data for 2015 survey has not been completed, and the 2016 follow-up assessment will be administered at the end of the Winter Quarter in March 2016. 

Winter 2016:
In the Winter 2016 Quarter, a total of 236 students enrolled in the Sustainability I course and 205 participated in the sustainability literacy survey. This represents 0.73% of the total UCI population (Winter 2016). As the Winter 2016 Quarter has not yet ended, these students have not received the follow-up assessment; it is scheduled to be administered before the end of the quarter (March 2016). 

Winter 2015
In the 2015 Winter Quarter, a total of 198 students who were enrolled in the Sustainability I course participated in the sustainability literacy survey. This represents 0.72% of the total UCI population (Winter 2015). Follow-up assessment data for these students has not been reported.

Winter 2014
In the 2014 Winter Quarter, 206 students enrolled in the Sustainability I course participated in the sustainability literacy survey. Of the 206 students who completed the pre-test, 166 students completed the post-test surveys. The 166 students who completed both pre-test and post-test survey in 2014 represent  0.63% of the total UCI student population (Winter Quarter 2014); the 40 students who completed only the pre-test survey in 2014 represent  0.15% of the total UCI student population. Analysis of the ecoliteracy section assessed the improvement of accurate responses by students before and after the course. The course average for the ecoliteracy section changed from 73% to 97% before and after the course, respectively. This represents a statistically significant change with a p-value p=0.000 on a standardized paired sample t-test. A scale was calculated after accounting for reverse coded questions for each of the sections: pro-environmental behavior and food, purchasing, waste, and driving behaviors. For each scale a standardized paired sample t-test was calculated to test the change from pre-test to post-test. Students revealed a statistically significant change in some of these sections.  Students reported more sustainable behavior in food purchasing (p=.08) and waste practices (p=.005). Driving, sustainable purchasing, and pro-environmental behaviors did not show statistically significant changes. 

Winter 2013
In the 2013 Winter Quarter, A total of 210 Sustainability I students participated in the sustainability literacy assessment, completing both the pre-test and post-test surveys. This represents 0.84% of the total UCI student population (Winter 2013). Analysis of the ecoliteracy section assessed the improvement of accurate responses by students before and after the course. Of the values, attitudes, and environmental behavior questions asked of students, only the mean student scores on the ecoliteracy survey were significantly higher at the end of the course than before the course began in the Winter 2013 Quarter at UC Irvine. A standardized paired sample t-test was run to determine this result using SPSS20. The student average was .7402/1 before the quarter began and .7748/1 at the end of the quarter, with a p value of p = .002.

","The assessment was developed by the Director of Sustainable Development (SUDV). Working with a student research assistant, the Director contacted approximately twenty other institutions of higher education with programs or minors in sustainability/sustainable development to request copies of any existing assessments. After determining that none of the programs contacted had a well-developed assessment tool in place, the Director developed an assessment that incorporated elements of each of the three main components of sustainability (equity, environment, economy) and also measured the learning outcomes established for the minor in SUDV. The assessment was reviewed by the SUDV teaching faculty and key sustainability staff at UCCS, then revised according to this feedback.","At the end of the Sustainability Seminar Capstone Course, each student is provided with a quiz that evaluates their baseline knowledge of sustainability issues.  It is important to note that while this course is required of all students graduating with a minor in Sustainable Development, this course is open to students in all degrees and departments and many of the students come from different fields of study.

Minor wording modifications, and additional questions, have been added throughout the years, as noted in the questions. The results are used to target outreach strategies, and to provide policy and program feedback to the President's office.","The survey was administered in spring 2015 and sent out multiple times in the University Student Daily Digest email.  The link to the survey was also made available online.  We will be following up with the respondents who said yes to a follow up via email (182 respondents being followed up).
","Every few years the OEP sends out an environmental awareness survey to see how well our office is handling UConn’s important environmental issues. We design questions to determine which areas of sustainability are most important to UConn students and faculty. In 2015 there were 347 respondents. Respondents were asked if they would be willing to take a follow up survey; 52% said yes. Key findings from the 2015 Environmental Awareness Survey include:
•	27% of undergraduate respondents believed the most important environmental issue on campus is recycling
•	Using renewable energy sources for campus needs (61%) and reducing plastic waste (57%) were environmental initiatives most important to UConn for the undergraduate respondents
•	Undergraduate respondents recycle Sneakers and E-waste more at home than at school; 3% to 10% and 4% to 11% respectively.
•	Only 50% of undergraduate respondents were aware of UConn’s Mixed Recycling program
•	Undergraduate respondents believe more recycling bins outdoors (24%) and carrying reusable water bottles (86%) to be the best ways to increase recycling and reduce waste
•	31% of undergraduate respondents never use the shuttle system and 27% only use it three or fewer times per month
•	65% of respondents said that only try to reduce energy and water use in their residence sometimes
",http://ecohusky.uconn.edu/outreach/easurvey.html,"Although just over 2% of the student population answered our survey, the data represents the university population relatively well. Given the number of students that attend the university, having everyone take the Environmental Awareness Survey would be challenging and limitations would arise. The demographics in this data are based on year in university (freshman, sophomore, etc.), gender, and whether or not students live on or off campus. Notably, gender was skewed towards female, with more female responses than other options. It is hard to determine the percentage of students assessed by this survey, but the voluntary survey questionaire went out to the entire student population through the Daily Digest."

","Researchers at the University of Maryland (UMD) and the Ohio State University (OSU) have developed an assessment to measure sustainability knowledge across its three domains: environmental, economic, and social.  The Assessment of Sustainability Knowlegde (ASK) is already helping other colleges and universities discover what their students know, or don’t know, about sustainability.  Research teams at UMD and OSU each started developing their own sustainability knowledge assessments in 2009 and then joined forces in 2012 to merge the best of each of their questions into one assessment.  In the spring of 2013, more than 3,000 UMD and OSU undergraduate students completed the combined assessment.  Researchers then analyzed how each question performed using Item Response Theory to create a valid question set for testing sustainability knowledge.  ",The assessment survey was emailed to a random sample of a quarter of all undergraduate students and a quarter of all graduate students. ,"Findings show that in general UMD students have a good understanding of sustainability concepts; however, we also uncovered some significant gaps in knowledge. For instance:

Only 58% of UMD students could identify an effect of global climate change.
Only 54% of UMD students could identify the most common cause of pollution of streams and rivers.
Only 49% of UMD students identified “reducing consumption” as a greater step toward sustainability than “recycling” or “buying products labeled ‘eco’ or ‘green’.”
Only 46% of UMD students could identify the greatest pressure leading to the degradation of the Chesapeake Bay’s ecosystem.
Only 42% of UMD students could put a list of common activities in order of largest to smallest environmental impact.
Only 37% of UMD students could identify the leading cause of the depletion of fish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean.

University of Michigan,2016-01-11,2016-01-11 15:37:48,ahorning@umich.edu,2.0,Pursuing,100.0,--,http://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/344/6/467/2662/2014SCIP_StudentQuestionnaire.pdf,,"In October 2009, U-M President Mary Sue Coleman elevated the University's commitment to sustainability in teaching, research, operations, and engagement by creating the U-M Environmental Sustainability Executive Council. One of the first actions of the Council was endorsing a Campus Sustainability Integrated Assessment (CSIA) to analyze the U-M’s sustainability efforts to date, benchmark against other institutions, and chart a course for the future through identifying long term goals for sustainable operations on the U-M Ann Arbor campus, including the Athletic Department and the Health System. The CSIA builds on a long history of sustainability commitments in U-M campus operations, such as implementing cogeneration technology at the Central Power Plant in the 1960s, adopting the EPA Green Lights and Energy Star programs in the 1990s, and more recently establishing LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification as the standard for new non-clinical construction projects where the construction value exceeds $10M.
The final CSIA report outlines four high level themes – Climate Action, Waste Prevention, Healthy Environments, and Community Awareness. Accompanying the themes are Guiding Principles to direct the U-M’s long-range strategy and 2025 Goals that are time-bound and quantifiable. SCIP stems from the principles outlined under CSIA theme of Community Awareness. They indicate that the U-M will “pursue evaluation strategies toward a campus-wide ethic of sustainability” as articulated in President Coleman’s September 2011 speech announcing the sustainability goals. Specifically, she stated that “we will scientifically measure and report our progress and behavior as a community…ISR (Institute for Social Research) researchers will measure the sustainability attitudes and activities of students, faculty and staff, as well as identify where we can improve.” Two separate questionnaires were developed --- one for staff and faculty, and one for students. While many of the questions were similar, different time frames and sequences were used in the two versions. With a primary objective of the project being to inform progress toward the CSIA goals, modules were developed with most questions focusing on transportation, waste prevention, the natural environment, food, and knowledge of U-M sustainability efforts.","To ensure representation from all segments of the University community and to allow for subsequent analysis of panel data, the sample design aimed to obtain relatively large numbers from the entire student body and from the staff and faculty populations. Specifically, a stratified sample was selected by the Registrar’s Office to yield approximately 1000 respondents from each undergraduate class (or cohort) and 400 graduate student respondents. At the same time, a stratified sample was selected by the University’s Office of Human Resources with a target of 750 staff and 750 faculty.", Please see the findings section of the SCIP Year 2 Report Overview http://graham.umich.edu/media/files/SCIP-Year-2-Overview.pdf,--,--

Total respondents were 1385 students. The survey was designed to assess MU student environmental literacy, concerns, and behaviors for use in program planning and assessment. It was a follow-up to a survey administered in 2009. 

A few of the themes of the survey include:
Self-reported environmental behavior
Environmental literacy
Environmental impact  self-efficacy
Perception of peer support for environmental behavior
Perception of institutional support for environmental behavior
Emotion component of environmental behavior/environmental activism
Programming – MU specific
New Environmental Paradigm (NEP)
","The assessment was administered over the period of 3/26/2012 12:00:00 AM - 10/31/2012 11:59:00 PM and was distributed via email. 

","See attached document for questions and quantitative results.

Qualitative Literacy Results:

Question 12: Please indicate your level of agreement with the following statement-I have a pretty good understanding of what environmental sustainability means. More than 83% of respondents agreed with this statement. 
*This question provides a good framework to recognize the current understanding of sustainability among the student body.  In addition it provides a base for the open ended Question 24 that follows Question 23 below:

Question 23: How closely does the following definition resemble your definition of sustainability? ""Environmental sustainability means meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""

Question 24 (206 Answers): Do you have a different definition of environmental sustainability? 

This question asked whether respondents have a different definition of sustainability from the standard, “environmental sustainability means meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” This proves to be important in understanding student literacy of sustainability as a whole. 

A few examples of their responses include:

* ""Action and inaction taken as necessary to improve real nature's ability to withstand the onslaught of human nature. 'Meeting the needs of the present generation' is impossible to do 'without compromising...future generations' since the needs aren't defined and apparently are too vast right now to even be met.""

* ""Environmental sustainability demands the co-existence of nature and humanity. It seeks human work in order to detain the ongoing destruction of our planet. The future is not an important aspect in environmental sustainability because we have to focus on the present, in my humble opinion.""

* ""Environmental sustainability requires everyone really consider about not only themselves, but also the people and they do not know ,the animals the plants. We cannot be selfish if you really cares about environmental sustainability, we need to make efforts to help a tree, a people living in other country, and new generation to live in good and health way.""

**The questions displayed here are a sample of questions that pertain to sustainability literacy and will be included in the next student survey to serve as a benchmark to illustrate whether an improvement of sustainable literacy exists on campus.**

The survey was developed to create a baseline assessment of the sustainability literacy on each campus and will be updated and sent out to campus students, faculty and staff every two years.  ",The assessment was administered as a survey instrument through UMKC Institutional Research via Survey Monkey,"Overview of Preliminary Findings
The following bullet points contain the key findings from the preliminary reports retrieved from Survey Monkey on November 9, 2012.
Across campus, awareness of recycling and waste reduction efforts was the greatest, ranging from 88% to 97% of respondents aware of these efforts.
The definition of sustainability resonating most was the following:
“Taking the long-term view of how our actions affect future generations and making sure we don’t deplete resources or cause pollution at rates faster than the earth is able to renew them.”
The overwhelming majority of respondents is at least ‘slightly interested’ in environmental issues.  Similarly, most respondents believe environmental issues affect their lives.
Sixty percent or greater report a willingness (moderately or strongly willing) to participate in sustainability activities on campus.
The campus could benefit from greater efforts to communicate contact information for the sustainability offices on campus.  Sixty percent or greater did not know the contact person on campus.
Responses varied to how well-informed the campus community is regarding sustainability efforts.

We included many more value-based questions on the follow-up survey, as well as several questions very specific to our campus, for example we included questions specific to herbacide use on campus, an issue we are currently working on to improve.","All current students were sent the assessments via email and were asked to complete them within a two week period. We received 1,035 responses of over 9,300 total students surveyed.  We received slightly over 200 responses from the follow-up survey.
Our sample included ~35% responses from College of Letters & Science; ~30% College of Natural Resources; ~23% College of Professional Studies and ~9% from College of Fine Arts & Communication and undecided ~3%
Responses by education level: Freshman 13%; Sophomores 19%; Juniors ~22%; Seniors ~35%; graduate level students ~11%","We identified 11 of 25 fact-based questions that had <50% correct responses.
Results indicated that most students are concerned or somewhat concerned with sustainability issues.
Top-rated campus issues indicated that we should work on include: increased renewable energy production on campus, increased purchases of local and organic food in dining services, becoming a zero-waste campus and working to meet our carbon neutrality committment deadlines.",--,--

We adopted some questions and eliminate a few to make it applicable to our climate and environmental issues.","Using surveymonkey.com we asked students to complete the survey. They were incentivized with prizes like solar cell phone chargers. Students were notified through various emails and social media posts. 

The first assessment was conducted in December of 2013. In 2013 we received a response from 16.2% of our students. There was equal representation of grade status and gender. 

","The twenty-six survey questions addressed six topics of sustainability. The questions were divided into 6 subject groups; Natural Resources, Economy, Energy, Climate, Behavior, and Policy. The results showed that students are learning about sustainability through their education, but we have a lot of room to improve. 
The 2013/14 data analysis included a 16.2% student response rate, consistently spread throughout the student population. The cumulative average of student scores was 62.9%. First year students scored an average of 55.2%, second year students scored 59.4%, third year students averaged 65.5%, and fourth year students scored and average of 69.7%. The analysis demonstrated a steady and positive upward trends of student scores as they progress throughout their time at Wartburg College, with the overall increase of approximately 14.5 percentage points between first and fourth year students. Students scored the best in the Policy category (74.7% correct) and poorest in the Energy group (54.4%).
The 2014/15 data analysis included a 11.7% student response rate, spread throughout the student population. The cumulative average of student scores was 67.8%, a 4.9% increase from last year, alluding to an increase in sustainability knowledge. First year students scored an average of 59.5%, second year students scored 64.5%, third year students averaged 70.9%, and fourth year students scored and average of 75.0%, maintaining the trend of an overall increase of approximately 15.4 percentage points between first and fourth year students. 
A measurement of change within a consistent group of students (i.e. the 2013 first year results compared to the 2014 second year results) showed an average of 5.0% increase in knowledge. The level of improvement increased with each class, as compared to the previous class. It is also notable that students demonstrated an increase of knowledge in the climate category, more than any other. The senior class of 2015 showed the greater amount of growth when compared to their answers the previous year.
We have learned the end of term, during finals may yield a better response. We believe the timing of the assessment is the reason we received a lower response rate.
