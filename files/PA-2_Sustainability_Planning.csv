In particular, the course considers environmental, social, ethical, historical, scientific, economic, and political influences.  http://www.fgcu.edu/Colloquium/","Passing the University Colloquium is an undergraduate degree requirement for all baccalaureates. 
The course goals are:
•	to provide a sense of place and an understanding of the unique ecological features of the Southwest Florida environment;
•	to assist in achieving the Florida Gulf Coast University learning goal of developing ""an ecological perspective"" and in teaching the related outcomes that the student will
•	""..know the issues related to economic, social, and ecological sustainability, analyze and evaluate ecological issues locally and globally, participate in collaborative projects requiring awareness and/or analysis of ecological and environmental issues;""

•	to enable a working understanding of sustainability, of environmental education, and of ecological literacy.

Concept Adopted At The January 15, 1997 Dean's Council Meeting 

We have made a commitment as a university to make environmental education an integral part of our identity. One of our university-wide outcomes is that all students will develop ""an ecological perspective"". A way to accomplish this perspective is to devise a course, or group of experiences, with an environmental focus that all FGCU students must complete, and in which faculty from all four colleges would be involved. Because ""ecology"" applies to our total living space and interrelationships, human and natural, it is relevant to all our disciplines and professions. Thus, an ecology course would touch on all nine of the university-wide goals and outcomes, and more. Students would not only be introduced to FGCU values, they would participate in them.

",The Physical Plant monitors and sets measurable waste reduction goals through Recyclemania as described in EN-5 of this report.  ,FGCU Physical Plant,True,True,"In addition to maintenance of the buildings and landscaped grounds, the Physical Plant Department currently has responsibility for managing and monitoring extensive University areas (approximately 420 acres) devoted to restored, created, and preserved wetlands and upland areas, to ensure compliance with the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, Department of Environmental Protection, and South Florida Water Management District permit requirements. The University has an active program of Melaleuca eradication using Department of Corrections’ inmates and physical and chemical methods. Master Plan policies dictate the use of “natural” or informal landscape designs and indigenous plant materials in order to minimize maintenance and achieve the University’s aesthetic vision and goals. The Athletic Department maintains the athletic and recreation fields on campus. All work on the wetlands and grounds is done through contractual services with consultants and qualified private firms.

Currently, the building sites in Basins 2 and 3 have been predominantly developed with stormwater management infrastructure in place. These two basins (Basin 2= The Academic Core and Basin 3 and the Student Housing/Recreation Area) have obtained permits that account for much of the developable land. No additional mitigation will be required for development of the remainder of these basins, provided this development is 
consistent with the direction provided in the initial conceptual permit. Future development in these areas that varies from the term of the initial conceptual permit will require SFWMD stormwater attenuation and mitigation as specified when those permits are issued. 

Basin 4 consists of the development of approximately 48 acres. Stormwater Management criteria are included with this permit application including the utilization of dry detention, wet detention, and incorporation of existing wetlands as attenuation features.

The potable water and fire systems in the central core have been installed and are designed to be extended to future development in the central core area as that development takes place. A proposed South Entrance road to the South Village Housing Area will also include a future water main connection that provides redundancy to the area.
