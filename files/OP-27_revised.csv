Although Colorado water law imposes restrictions on the amount of LID we can incorporate (rainwater harvesting is illegal in Colorado except where a residential parcel has a domestic water well, or a legal water augmentation plan is established), CSU incorporates LID methods that infiltrate stormwater whenever a site is redeveloped (e.g. a building is constructed in an former parking lot location), and whenever a new building is constructed in a formerly undeveloped area. Our landscape architects design surface drainage features that are pleasing, convey stormwater through native plantings and enhance infiltration. New buildings typically incorporate swales,  and plantings that receive and use the stormwater, rather than connecting roof drains directly to subsurface storm sewers. Where feasible, landscaping and hardscape are configured to minimize directly connected impervious areas; this helps reduce unnecessary impervious areas and routes stormwater from impervious surfaces over permeable areas to slow runoff and increase infiltration.

CSU has an MS4 permit issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the plan for which includes a provision to review and incorporate permanent BMPs with new and redeveloped parcels.

Examples of CSU’s LID implementation at its Fort Collins campuses include the following:

•	At least 29 detention/extended detention ponds
•	More than 26,000 square feet of permeable pavers
•	At least 10 bioswales
•	Several constructed wetlands
•	A green roof

",TRUE," CSU has a storm water permit that regulates what measures the university must take and what is to be done to minimize storm water pollution. It is structured with six ""Minimum Measures,"" each of which has multiple goals and requirements. Discharges of processed waste water or contaminated water are not allowed to go to storm drains. In some cases, a specific discharge permit can be obtained to allow discharge of waste water. However, these permits may require monitoring, reporting and treatment to meet the discharge limits. CSU's storm water and surface water discharges are regulated by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE).

Managing Stormwater
Increased stormwater runoff from developed areas is one  of the most pervasive problems of an urbanizing world. While the opportunity exists to capture stormwater runoff and allow it to infiltrate the soil mantle, the conventional approach has been to treat the runoff as a drainage problem and to “solve” the problem with engineering 
solutions. These solutions are expensive, require a lot of maintenance, remove natural habitat, are usually unattractive, and ultimately not sustainable. Promoting open space development that is based on sustainable principles will also involve integrating sustainable alternatives to conventional stormwater management. Demonstration projects can be incorporated into site development associated with new buildings as well as retrofits. These projects can be based on models that replicate the natural hydrologic cycle. 

Strategies:
• Identify small-scale projects that have the potential to capture and divert existing run-off into landscape features designed for storage, conveyance and reuse. These retrofit opportunities can be made economically viable in conjunction with new buildings, building improvements or site improvement projects. 
• Integrate stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP’s) like rain gardens, green roofs, cisterns, retention ponds, bio-filtration swales, and pervious pavement into site and building design. These landscape features can be designed to discreetly fit  within the urban landscape or integrated into planting areas. For instance, the redesign of the site and landscape behind Alt House can include disconnecting roof drains and diverting them into a rain garden, creating a green roof on the existing footprint of the Central Utility Plant (CUP).
• Develop campus wide landscape “management” strategy to convert lawn areas in parts of the campus into an ecological landscape using native plantings. This will help to reduce storm run-off from these areas and provide screening, ecological, aesthetic, and other intangible benefits to the campus.

The West Campus area encompasses approximately 600 acres and is generally bounded by public rights-of-way of Erwin Road, Cameron Boulevard, Duke University Road and Anderson Street.  West Campus includes the Duke Medical Center, Administrative and Academic Buildings, Athletic Buildings and Playing Fields, Student Fields, Student Housing, Duke Gardens and forested conservation areas.  The East Campus area encompasses approximately 90 acres and is bounded by public rights-of-way of Broad Street, Main Street, Buchanan Boulevard and Markham Avenue.

The Duke University campus lies along the division line between two major river basins:  the Neuse River Basin and the Cape Fear River Basin.  The majority of the Duke Campus, including Duke Gardens, flows south into the Cape Fear River Basin.  The majority of Duke’s East Campus flows north to the Neuse River Basin.

The regulating authority for campus is the City of Durham.  In 2004, Duke University submitted a Stormwater Impact Analysis (SIA) with the City of Durham and began to look at stormwater on a regional basis.  The SIA model was originally divided into 48 sub-basins and is updated with each project on campus.  The SIA model is a cover conditions model and is based on soil type from the Durham County soil survey information.  Ultimately each sub-basin was analyzed and assigned a CN value.  Cover conditions are updated with each project and CN values are calculated to determine impervious cover impacts or the need for detention.

There have been many updates to the original 2004 SIA that added specific water quality requirements for each river basin.  In addition to detention, ordinance updates in 2009 and 2010 outlined requirements for the 1-year storm analysis for the whole campus.  This update required the original 48 sub-basins to be further sub-divided into 76 sub-basins for the Water Quality Model.  The City of Durham also has specific Water Quality Control requirements for Total Suspended Solids, Nitrogen and Phosphorus based on established thresholds for each river basin.

Points are earned towards certification via a variety of sustainable design features. These often include low impact development strategies to reduce rainwater/stormwater runoff. For instance, the Stata Center features an innovative storm water retention and management system that employs biofiltration, as well as a roof that incorporates landscaping for storm water retention (http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/stata.html). In 2010, MIT won a Cambridge GoGreen award for the Stata Center’s storm water management (https://sustainability.mit.edu/sustainability-today/natural-systems). Both the Brain and Cognitive Science Building and the Stata Center have rainwater harvesting and reuse systems and use reclaimed water for irrigation and toilet flushing (https://sustainability.mit.edu/sustainability-today/natural-systems). Ashdown House, a graduate student residence, has a storm water management system that includes a filtration system and an irrigation system connected to central weather station for minimization of watering (http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/ashdown.html). Similarly, the newly expanded Sloan School of Business has a storm water filtration system that will improve the quality of water that reaches the Charles River (http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/sloan.html).

MIT also plays a key role in the ongoing revitalization of the Charles River, a response to the EPA’s Clean Charles River Initiative.  Along with the Boston area community, MIT participates in stewardship activities such as numerous river cleanup events, water sampling for the Charles River Watershed Association, and storm water management on campus (https://sustainability.mit.edu/sustainability-today/natural-systems).",TRUE,"MIT works extensively to reduce its water usage through a variety of strategies, including the deployment of technologies such as: installation of low-flow shower heads and toilets and educational signs efficient washing machines; and installation of a centralized irrigation system at the Stata Center, which uses weather data to control water flow and can identify leaks and cut off water flow in order to minimize watering.  

These initiatives have saved MIT 70,000,000 gallons of water per year and have helped MIT’s water usage fall 60 percent between 1997 and 2005. ",5,"One of the design features of the Stata Center “harvests” rain water for reuse, thereby reducing MIT’s city water use by nearly three quarters of a million gallons a year. This same system also significantly reduces pollution that could impact the Charles River. The Stata Center’s “biofiltration” stormwater management system accomplishes both through award-winning design. This stormwater management system manifests itself to the passer-by as a natural oasis wedged in-between Buildings 56 and 57 – identified by the curious stonewall sculptured banks, natural vegetation, and scenic footbridge. This “bioswale” is just one component in the Stata Center’s overall landscape design that uses a “biomimicry” concept that reintroduces natural systems such as varied topography and vegetation into the built environment.

The Stata Center stormwater collection system provides for more efficient use of water resources because it serves as a rainwater “harvester” - collecting rainwater, storing it, and reusing it within the Stata Center building for flushing water for toilets and urinals and for landscape irrigation. Stormwater collected and “polished” in the bioswale is pumped into the Stata Center where it is treated with multimedia filtration and an ultraviolet sterilization system, stored in tanks, and pumped to lavatories as flushing water. It is estimated that the Stata Center building consumes approximately 5,000 gallons per day for flushing water. This maximized water efficiency reduces potable water use, minimizes burdens on the municipal water systems, and reduces water costs for MIT. To boot, a solar powered pump is used to irrigate the bioswale vegetation with recycled water, further reducing potable water use.",750000,"MIT mitigates stormwater runoff from the Stata Center site that can impact the Charles River with an innovative, state-of-the art stormwater control and treatment system. Stormwater runoff from the Stata Center and some adjacent roofs (part of Building 26, all of Buildings 56 and 57) is drained to and stored in the “biofiltration” swale. The swale is a depression in the landscape designed to collect water and is constructed with soils and vegetated with plant species to provide natural filtration. The plant species employed are capable of filtering oil and grease as well as suspended solids from stormwater. Runoff entering this swale filters through the vegetation and is detained below grade in a galley chamber. Instead of flowing directly into the city’s sewer system during storms and possibly directly into the Charles River untreated, this potentially contaminated stormwater runoff is diverted into Stata’s biofiltration system where it is “polished”, and then gradually released to the sewer system at a rate that can be absorbed by municipal sewer treatment plants. During heavy rains storms, because of antiquated city systems, much of the stormwater would overwhelm the city’s ability to treat it and it would be diverted directly in to the Charles River. During a heavy rain storm, the MIT stormwater system diverts and temporarily stores up to 50% of the untreated runoff water headed for the sewer system or river. The system also removes up to 80% of the solids in the runoff.

One of the most successful uses of permeable pavement can be observed in the integrated design of the Black Cultural Center (BCC) parking lot.  Pavement was used in the parking stalls of the lot to infiltrate runoff, and the parking lot was graded to direct runoff towards a central bioswale surrounded by impervious concrete pavement.  This design redirected debris and particulates, which would have otherwise clogged the porous surfaces.  Excess runoff was then directed into another bioswale at the north end of the parking lot.

These entities have significant regulations regarding detention and compensatory storage due to the frequency and severity of flooding in Houston.
 
For compensatory storage, regulations require that there be no net loss of volume in the 100-year flood plain.  Thus, because a portion of Rice’s campus lies in this flood plain, if the University fills a cubic foot of dirt from the land, then it must excavate a cubic foot of storage volume elsewhere in that flood plain (and this volume must be open to the sky).
  
For stormwater detention, regulations require that for every acre of impervious land cover, 0.55 acre-feet of storage must be provided.  See page 6-21 of http://www.hcfcd.org/downloads/manuals/HCFCD_PCPM_Dec2010.pdf

","Rice follows the City of Houston's and the Harris County Flood Control District's stormwater regulations which include providing no net loss of volume in the 100-year flood plain and providing 0.55 acre feet of detention for every acre of impervious space.  
Currently, the Harris Gully Natural Area on Rice’s campus meets both the compensatory and detention storage requirements for most of the campus; however, as Rice continues to develop, the University has started to use other methods to meet the storage and detention requirements mandated by the City of Houston.  For example, the lawn in front of Rice's recently constructed continuing studies building, the Anderson-Clarke Center, has a slight depression so as to provide its own compensatory storage on-site.  
Furthermore, Rice actively seeks out areas where sidewalks and other impervious materials can be removed.  ","Rice's North Annex Parking Lot has three planting beds in between the parking spaces which serve as bioswales.

Enhancing Environmental Stewardship
By implementing this plan, the college will enhance its unique connection to its region and sense of place and become an even stronger steward of the environment. For example, indigenous plant species will visually link the campus to the surrounding woodland, help reduce the amount of maintenance required and conserve water. By reducing the amount of impervious area within the campus, less run-off will be created. Where there are large amounts of pavement, in parking lots and along the Concourse for example, visually-appealing bioswales will retain storm water on campus and recharge the local ground water.

On the east side of campus, stormwater issues were handled in the mid-90s through the use of retention ponds and vaults.  At that time the University planned for projected increases in construction.  Along with this, buildings built within the past eight years have included a stormwater collection system to allow the water to be used later for irrigation.  Most current work for stormwater over the past several years has been on the west side of campus.  This includes repair of creek banks and the addition of energy dissipaters.  There is also a current requirement for structures built on this side of campus to design so as not to add to the velocity of water.  This has been accomplished with the use of stormwater collection and detention ponds.

Education - Texas A&M has partnered with the local city governments, county, and Texas Department of Transportation to bring a unified message about stormwater protection to the public.  This has been accomplished through multiple media outlets (television, radio, newspapers, fliers, etc).  The group also takes its message to local schools assisting with educating children about pollution and stormwater.  Texas A&M also placed stormwater markers at each inlet to remind individuals that only stormwater is allowed down storm drains.  Each marker provides the effected stream.

The University also has a volunteer program in which staff and students spend a Saturday once per year cleaning a creek bank.  This past year 127 volunteers removed 115 bags of trash from creek banks.

• The Laurel Hall classroom building was opened in December, 2011, with a permanent green roof: the building has numerous environmentally conscious and sustainable energy features, including an installed green roof, planted with sedum and other low-growing, drought tolerant, ground cover type plants. It is easily visible from the third floor of the new classroom building, which is used by 10,000 students per semester for classes.
• Storrs Hall, home to the School of Nursing, was recently renovated, adding the 15,800 square-foot Widmer Wing. Storrs Hall is 103 years-old, one of the oldest structures at UConn, and now incorporates LEED features including a green roof patio for stormwater flow reduction and treatment.
","Porous concrete and permeable asphalt parking lots were installed in the summer of 2009 outside the Greer Field House and Towers Residence Halls. Permeable asphalt was also recently installed at the Whetten Graduate Center and the Storrs Hall parking lots. These porous materials allow rain and melted snow to drain through the concrete or asphalt surface into the soil below, mimicking natural drainage. Porous concrete and asphalt are better for the environment than traditional asphalt parking lots, which cause water to accumulate and flow off of the parking lot surface and into storm drains, causing erosion and carrying sediment and pollution into our rivers and streams.
Additionally, porous paving technology has been used in walkways and terraces surrounding Laurel, Oak, and Storrs Halls, as well as at the Lakeside building. Additionally, the newly completed reconstruction of Hillside Road in which approximately 2,700 linear feet of roadway was lined on both sides by permeable interlocking brick pavers interspersed with tree, lawn, and flower areas. The School of Business also put in porous pavers on its south side sidewalks. The Northwood Apartment complex also installed porous pavement. Finally, the newly completed Sundial Plaza in the center of campus also has porous paving technology.

","The University employs downspout disconnections in conjunction with its green roofs and bioswale systems. Downspouts are routed through green roofs and bioswales for buildings with these features available.
",The University has employed rain gardens throughout campus to treat runoff and help infiltration in a number of different areas around campus. Rain gardens have been put in at the Hillel House and the Hilltop and Mansfield Apartment Complexes to specifically deal with stormwater runoff from the apartment buildings. UConn has also put in a rain garden at the Whetten Graduate Center in a traffic turnaround to help treat road runoff as well as stormwater from the surrounding buildings.,"Mirror Lake and Swan Lake are man-made ponds serving as both stormwater detention basins (UConn's largest) as well as central landscape elements on the main campus. The campus is a relatively densely developed area amid a more rural community with adjacent agricultural land uses - thus all drainage from the campus impervious surfaces needs to be captured in detention basins to ensure no net increase in off-site drainage rates during various storm events. LID goals are also to reduce both rate and volume of stormwater discharges by infiltrating as much as possible, in conjunction with conventional detention basins. The goal is improved water quality in the area's streams, lakes and other water bodies.","Several vegetated swales are located throughout the University to manage stormwater, including one behind the tennis courts, and another in front of the new classroom building.
Vegetated swales were installed around Laurel Hall that was completed in 2011, capturing runoff from the impervious roof and surrounding area, as well as the newly completed Oak Hall, which opened for academic year 12-13, to serve the same purpose. Both swales are contained by gabion baskets and feature medium sized plantings and groundcover. A bioretention island has also been added to the Whetten Graduate Center parking lot to treat runoff from the road and the surrounding buildings.
","Incorporating bio-retention areas, rain gardens, vegetated basins, vegetated swales, constructed wetlands, GrassPave® technology etc. on site to treat stormwater.

The University is working with MSD to determine ways to fund installation sub-surface inflitration basins to accept stormwater runoff and replenish the aquifer.",TRUE,"UofL is working with Louisville's Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) on a variety of ""green infrastructure"" projects to help keep stormwater runoff out of the combined sewer system. In the past, every raindrop that hit UofL's rooftops (over 2.2 million square feet on Belknap campus alone!) and pavements was channeled into the same sewer system that handles our sewage which truly needs to be treated. But, as our former Vice-President for Business Affairs, Larry Owsley put it, ""When you have that much rain in that short a time, the sewers — which are large sewers — just back up and there's no place for the water to go."" Even if the sewers can handle stormwater from UofL, the treatment plants at the end of the pipe often cannot, leading to dangerous releases of untreated sewage into the Ohio River - a threat to human health and ecological integrity.

UofL has pursued means of lessening the risk of flood and reducing our campus' contribution to the problem by diverting stormwater from the sewer system all together through infiltration and rainwater harvesting projects, or by slowing its release through water absorbing changes to our campus landscape. Around campus, we have disconnected downspouts, installed vegetated green roofs, and built rain gardens and bioswales to facilitate groundwater recharge through infiltration.

In recent years, UofL made several changes to campus landscaping, parking lots and rooftops, with the help of $1.25 million in cost-sharing from MSD. We think that this significant investment will essentially pay for itself by helping prevent millions of dollars in future flood damage. We are also hoping the projects at UofL will serve as an example for similar projects across the city on both public and private property.

Most often bioretention includes a gravel layer surrounding an underdrain, a sandy media mix layer atop the gravel to encourage infiltration, vegetation to further increase infiltration and pollutant removal, and a mulch layer to keep in moisture and to prevent internal erosion. Space is left between the underdrain and the bottom of the bioretention basin to promote further storage and thus infiltration. There are several bioretention systems on campus. A great example is found right outside of the Dana Building on Central Campus",,Grassed or vegetated swales are engineered ditches that promote infiltration while conveying stormwater runoff.

* To minimize and/or regulate storm water surge volumes by promoting storm water sensitive design.
*  To educate our community about storm water issues.
*  To manage on-campus storm water problems efficiently and effectively.
*  To promote overall watershed protection by working with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA); Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR); and the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) owners and agencies represented by the Regional Stormwater Protection Team (RSPT)
",TRUE,"Some examples of storm water controls used at UMD are:

Rain Gardens and Bio-retention Areas are gardens that collect, filter and use storm water reducing the amount of water discharged to a storm water system. Flowering plants and grasses (preferably native species) that can withstand a cycle of flooding and drought are usually used.

Infiltration / Filtration Basins are open earthen impoundments designed to retain storm water and to infiltrate it into the soil. The design should include an inlet-settling basin to remove coarse materials prior to flowing into the infiltration basin. The surface may or may not be vegetated. Infiltration basins are used when you have permeable soils to accept the water, filtration basins have drain tile systems that collect the filtered water and discharge it to a storm sewer.

Infiltration / Filtration Trenches are trenches that are 1 to 2 feet wide, and 2 to 10 feet deep. They are typically lined on the sides and bottom with permeable filter fabric and backfilled with coarse aggregate. Trenches may be surface or subsurface levels, and design may include a vegetative filter strip. Trenches are effective in removing suspended sediments, floating debris, and bacteria. In most cases, trenches will have some overflow connection to the storm sewer. Infiltration trenches are used when you have permeable soils to accept the water, filtration trenches have drain tile systems that collect the filtered water and discharge it to a storm sewer.
Pervious (Permeable) Pavement is a structural support surface that allows water to flow through the material into a subsurface of gravel or rock, and ultimately into the soil or other post construction storm water control. Pavements can be made of concrete, asphalt, plastic, or composite materials. They can look like standard concrete or asphalt pavement, paving block or even grass.

Swales are vegetated, shallow channels with gentle side-slopes. Treatment occurs as storm water flows through the dense vegetation. Removal mechanisms for pollutants include filtration, sedimentation, adsorption, and infiltration into the soil profile. Swales are used to remove sediment and pollutants that adhere to the sediment.
Filter Strips are vegetated, gently sloped strip, 10 feet or more in down-slope length (50 to 75 feet is recommended for good performance). Vegetation may be turf, or forested with trees and shrubs. Filter strips must be designed to accept sheet flow, and are typically used in conjunction with other treatment control measures, such as grassy swales or infiltration trenches.

Underground Detention devices are tanks that can take large volumes of storm water quickly and then slowly discharge that water back into the storm water system. Underground systems are usually more expensive than other systems, but are useful on small sites.",5,"A unique and visible feature of Swenson Civil Engineering is its management of storm water runoff including scuppers made from reclaimed wood and a French drain system. The scuppers on the roof of the building were constructed from recycled wood; and runoff is collected in tanks beneath the building.  In non-winter months, the water in the tanks is used to fill a 2,000 gallon sediment transport/wave tank.  ",--,,"Civil Engineering has a partial green roof, and the Bagley Outdoor Classroom's lower roof is a green roof.  Both of these roofs utilize a tray system.

",TRUE,"The University of Minnesota maintains Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permits for its Twin Cities (UMTC) and Duluth (UMD) campuses. These permits require the University to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) as detailed in the campus-specific Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program in addressing storm water runoff from these campuses, with the goal of reducing pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. The University will implement these BMPs at other campuses and locations for all applicable construction projects and as otherwise appropriate. The required BMPs include implementation of a regulatory control program to address (1) prohibitions of illicit discharges and connections; (2) reduction of pollutants to the Maximum Extent Practicable; (3) establishment and enforcement of construction site runoff controls for waste, sediment and erosion; and (4) establishment and enforcement of post-construction runoff controls for new development and major renovation projects. This document establishes administrative procedures implementing the regulatory controls for these permits.

1. Discharge Prohibitions
Illegal discharges. No person will discharge to the storm drain system materials other than storm water. The following non-storm water discharges are exempt from this prohibition: uncontaminated groundwater infiltration, springs, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, water line flushing, irrigation water, uncontaminated foundation and footing drains, air conditioning condensation, water from crawl space pumps, street wash waters, discharges from potable sources, and flows from firefighting. The prohibition will not apply to non-storm water discharges permitted by the MPCA under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System/State Disposal System (NPDES/SDS) permit, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with the terms of the permit and that written approval has been granted by DEHS for discharge to the storm drain system. DEHS may exempt other non-storm discharges that are not the source of pollutants to the storm system; examples are short term construction site dewatering where there is no visible sediment and the discharge is pretreated to remove solids and monitored regularly; and dye testing of sewer lines.

Illicit Connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. The illicit connection of highest concern is sanitary effluent released to the storm drain system. This prohibition includes such connections made in the past, regardless of whether such connections were permissible at the time of connection. Upon discovery of such connections, written notification must be made immediately to DEHS. A plan to disconnect and redirect, if necessary, to the sanitary sewer system (upon approval of the authorized regulatory agency), must be submitted to DEHS within seven working days. 
Spills. Spills and any known or suspected release of prohibited wastes must be reported to DEHS (UMTC: 612-626-6002, UMD: 218-726-7139). Public reporting of illicit discharges can be made on-line through the University web site (www.ureport.umn.edu).

2. Reduction of Pollutants to the Maximum Extent Practicable
Activities, Operations, Facilities. The University through DEHS or its designated campus storm water point-of-contact, in consultation with campus representatives, will identify activities, operations and facilities that may cause pollution or contamination to the storm drain system. DEHS staff will work with appropriate managers, staff, and contractors to implement the Best Management Practices (BMPs) to the extent they are technologically achievable to prevent or reduce such pollutants. DEHS or its designated campus storm water point-of-contact will periodically monitor compliance with established BMPs.

Facilities Management is responsible for planning, funding, operation, and maintenance of the storm water conveyance system and storm water treatment BMPs. These activities are carried out in accordance with the campus Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program.

UMTC and UMD will each maintain a storm water advisory task force, comprised of, at a minimum, representatives from Facilities Management Engineering, Landcare, Parking, and DEHS. The purpose of this task force is to develop operational practices and identify desired outcomes related to the storm water program and water quality. This taskforce will coordinate with academic research and teaching activities that utilize or impact storm water BMPs.

3. Construction Site Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Construction Permits. The University will ensure that NPDES Construction Permits are in place before commencement of construction for all new development or redevelopments that require such permits. Such permits are required for any construction activity disturbing

one acre or more of land;
less than one acre of land if that activity is part of a ""larger common plan of development or sale"" that is greater than one acre; and
less than one acre of soil, but the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) determines that the activity poses a risk to water resources.
These permits will include the requisite Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPP). The SWPPPs will be prepared by the Architect/Engineer to comply with NPDES permit requirements and adhere to the storm water standards established by this procedure. These requirements will become part of the contractual relationships with the Architect/Engineer and the Contractor through contractual language or through the incorporation of University Construction Standards into the contracts. DEHS and its designated campus storm water point-of-contact will review, approve all NPDES Construction permit applications and SWPPs, and arrange for the owner's signature on permit applications.

Construction Site Erosion and Sediment Controls and Waste Controls. All construction projects that fall under the NPDES Construction Permit criteria (see above) are required to have temporary erosion and sediment controls. If deemed necessary, based on known conditions (environmental, utility locations) documented in the project design and engineering review process, DEHS or its designated campus storm water point-of-contact may require projects that disturb less than one acre of land to have erosion and sediment controls. For each project that requires an NPDES permit, Capital Planning Project Management (CPPM) project managers will ensure that

the Architect/Engineer incorporates into construction documents and SWPPPs these controls which will meet the established standards of this procedure and the State of Minnesota. Standards for temporary erosion and sediment controls and waste controls are detailed in Appendix A.  Projects on the Duluth campus must also comply with additional requirements described in Appendix: Duluth Campus Additional Requirements;
the Contractor implements these controls according to schedules and specifications in the construction documents; and
the Contractor  inspects for effectiveness of these controls and corrects any problems. The Contractor must document all inspections and corrections. The Contractor will provide an Erosion Control Supervisor with a valid certification in erosion prevention to direct the Contractor's and subcontractors' operations. Certification will be the equivalent of that offered by the University of Minnesota Erosion and Sediment Control Certification Program.
DEHS or its designated campus storm water point-of-contact will review these plans during the design phases of a project and review Contractor compliance during and after construction. Failure to comply with the SWPPP and this procedure will be addressed as stated in Appendix: Stormwater Enforcement Response.

4. Post Construction Storm Water Management
The University in its construction and planning processes is committed to minimizing the negative impacts on the natural site hydrologic cycle as much as possible by treating storm water close to where it falls, reducing downstream impacts thereby improving the overall water quality and clarity, recharging groundwater through infiltration as local soils and subsurface conditions allow, and re-using storm water wherever possible.

Projects that disturb 1 acre of land or more, except for linear projects such as utilities, sidewalks and paths, mill and overlay, and other resurfacing activities will implement a storm water management plan that minimizes impervious cover, promotes infiltration, and captures and treats the storm water runoff using acceptable Best Management Practices (BMPs) or any combination of BMPs, with highest preference given to green infrastructure techniques and practices (e.g., infiltration, evapotranspiration, reuse/harvesting, conservation design, green roofs, etc.). At a minimum, these standards will include the following required performance criteria:

Runoff: Rate and QuantityControl the rate of runoff from the post-development site to match the runoff rates for the native soil and vegetation conditions for the 2-year and 10-year, 24-hour design storms.
Prohibit discharge from the site for 1.1 inches of runoff from all new and redeveloped impervious (non-vegetated) areas.
Runoff Quality
Provide treatment systems designed to remove 80% of the post-development Total Suspended Solids (TSS).
Provide treatment systems designed to remove 60% of the post-development Total Phosphorus (TP).
Prepare and submit an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) manual for all installed stormwater BMPs. The O&M manual must outline maintenance requirements and schedules for completion.
Stormwater management limitations
The use of infiltration techniques will be prohibited when the infiltration structural stormwater BMP will receive discharges from, or be constructed in areas

where industrial facilities are not authorized to infiltrate industrial stormwater under an NPDES/SDS Industrial Stormwater Permit issued by MPCA;
where vehicle fueling and maintenance occur;
with less than three (3) feet of separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of the seasonally saturated soils or the top of bedrock; and
where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater will be mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater.
The use of infiltration techniques will be restricted, without higher engineering review, sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and prevent adverse impacts to groundwater, when the infiltration device will be constructed in areas

with predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay) soils;
within 1,000 feet up-gradient, or 100 feet down-gradient of active karst features;
within a Drinking Water Supply Management Area (DWSMA) as defined in Minn.R.4720.5100, subp. 13; and
where soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour.
Mitigation provisions
In locations where it is determined not feasible to meet the requirements for post-construction runoff quality (i.e., TSS and/or TP standards), either due to site conditions or lack of space; or the project is unable to recycle storm water locally, mitigation project can be completed at a different location with the following requirements:

Mitigation project areas are selected in the following order of preference:
Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity
Locations with the same Department of Natural Resources (DNR) catchment area as the original construction activity
Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area up-stream
Locations anywhere with the University's jurisdiction
Mitigation projects must involve the creation of a new structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater MBPs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
Mitigation projects must be completed within 24 months after the start of the original construction activity.
Cost for mitigation projects must be provided by the original construction project, and must meet all requirements of this Procedure.
In situations where it is not possible to implement a structural stormwater BMP solution, the University may employ decision-making processes recognized by the State of Minnesota, such  as Minimal Impact Design Standards (MIDS), to determine other forms of alternative compliance.

Alternative compliance actions will be evaluated based on benefits to water quality and rate of water runoff, improved operating cost (savings), and reduced first (capital) costs.

Site Design and Construction Process
Designing and implementing structural stormwater BMPs on sites of 1 acre or greater is the University of Minnesota’s first priority. 
Criteria to evaluate stormwater treatment options should include technical performance (rate and water quality, longevity, maintenance and operating cost), first (capital) cost and available land.  Alternative compliance methods may be considered only after any other mitigation strategies are evaluated.

As part of the design process, CPPM project managers will ensure that

CPPM will coordinate civil engineering scope of services with University subject matter experts (Energy Management Utilities);
Architect/Engineer incorporates post construction BMPs into construction documents to meet these standards to the maximum extent practicable and, as part of the plan review process, that the A/E will submit to DEHS the Construction Project Worksheet documenting project compliance with this requirement; and
the Contractor implements these BMPs according to the construction documents.
DEHS will review plans and submittals for compliance and review contractor compliance during and after construction. Failure to comply with this procedure may result in formal project review and appropriate corrective actions as described in the Enforcement Response Procedures (Appendix C).",5,"The 17th Ave Residence Hall toilet flushing system uses grey water from the rooftop.

http://www.arboretum.umn.edu/green_roof.aspx","Below is description of the Porous Pavement around TCF Bank Stadium:
Porous pavement is a pervious surface that allows storm water to percolate or infiltrate through and into the soil or drainage system below. The soil naturally filters the water and during the process, pollutants are removed. Impervious surfaces, in contrast, force storm water to runoff into the groundwater and storm drainage systems untreated. The purpose of porous pavement is to reduce storm water runoff, reduce the pollutants in runoff, and replenish groundwater supplies. In areas where minor flooding is a problem, pervious surfaces are often used to reduce the pooling of water by allowing it to seep through the surface. ",None,"Rain gardens are gardens that are planted where rainwater is purposly channeled into the site. Depending on the slope and amount of rain that can move into the

The Bioretention Garden commonly referred to a a rain garden, is a shallow depression with amended soils and a sub drain system to collect stormwater runoff, allowing for increased infiltration, and convey excess water slowly to the nearest outflow or channel. The capture keeps the stormwater from directly flowing into storm drains and surface waters, which creates potential for erosion, water pollution, flooding, and diminished groundwater replenishment. It reduces the amount of pollution reaching creeks and streams by up to 30%. The word “garden” is important. 

In most locations, Bioretention Gardens are noticeable parts of the landscape, so they have a design component for an aesthetic appeal. These gardens encourage wildlife and biodiversity and contribute to urban habitats for native butteries, birds, and benecial insects. But it is the Bioretention Garden’s function that is most important. The functionality depends on careful, combined management of water, soil and plants. 

Native plants are typically used in Bioretention Gardens, and are not only preferred for Bioretention Gardens, they are essential for their success. Native plants have roots that extend deep into the soil (up to 15 or more feet). These roots open up the soil pores, improve soil structure and quality, and enhance water infiltration. A typical Bioretention Garden might have the following cross-section. ",--,,,,,"The UNO Bioretention Garden functions as a stormwater best management practice that captures landscape and roof rainwater after each storm event and infiltrates the runoff into the soil within 12‐24 hours. It is similar to a rain garden, but since it handles significant volumes of water, it is designed with a valved underdrain trench and pipe that ensures good drainage prior to plant growth. Over time, the plants will establish deep root systems that will help infiltrate water into the soil and no runoff to the adjacent parking lot is expected to occur except during extreme rain events.
The plants have been selected for their adaptability to local climate and soil conditions, and most are native to the region. They are placed in the garden based upon their seasonal beauty, height, complementary combinations with adjacent plants, and relative tolerance for wet soils (frequent inundation in the garden bottom, never inundated outside of the garden ponding areas).
The garden is also designed to be an inviting “front door” to the UNO Welcome Center and it provides a comfortable campus space for students, faculty/staff, and campus visitors.",,"The Bioretention Garden commonly referred to a a rain garden, is a shallow depression with amended soils and a sub drain system to collect stormwater runoff, allowing for increased infiltration, and convey excess water slowly to the nearest outflow or channel. The capture keeps the stormwater from directly flowing into storm drains and surface waters, which creates potential for erosion, water pollution, flooding, and diminished groundwater replenishment. It reduces the amount of pollution reaching creeks and streams by up to 30%. The word “garden” is important. 

In most locations, Bioretention Gardens are noticeable parts of the landscape, so they have a design component for an aesthetic appeal. These gardens encourage wildlife and biodiversity and contribute to urban habitats for native butteries, birds, and benecial insects. But it is the Bioretention Garden’s function that is most important. The functionality depends on careful, combined management of water, soil and plants. 

Native plants are typically used in Bioretention Gardens, and are not only preferred for Bioretention Gardens, they are essential for their success. Native plants have roots that extend deep into the soil (up to 15 or more feet). These roots open up the soil pores, improve soil structure and quality, and enhance water infiltration.

The UNC stormwater staff conducts activities that meet the six minimum measures of the NPDES Phase II permit plus other activities that meet regulatory, infrastructure management, and sustainability goals. These programs cover the following areas: staff stormwater education and good practices, mapping, illicit discharge detection and elimination, public involvement, construction site erosion and sedimentation control, post-construction stormwater management, stormwater system maintenance, stormwater system condition evaluations, and stormwater retrofitting. 

New development and redevelopment projects address water quality, stormwater runoff volume, and peak discharge rate.

The UNC structural stormwater system is comprised of thousands of catch basins, inlets, and outfalls, miles of piping, and over 200 stormwater management practices. UNC property drains to Meeting of the Waters Creek, Battle Branch, Chapel Creek, Morgan Creek, Crow Branch, Booker Creek, Bolin Creek, and Little Creek. UNC is located within the Jordan Lake Watershed within the Cape Fear River Basin.",TRUE,"UNC has over 280 stormwater management practices in use. Traditional measures include ponds, wetlands, underground storage, bioretention, and sand filters. More innovative control measure include green roofs, permeable pavement, infiltration beds, vegetated swales, cisterns, and underground water quality improvement devices.",5,Multiple campus rooftops drain to cisterns that hold rainwater for reuse on landscapes and in toilets.,--,sand filters,"Six locations at UNC incorporate green roofs: Rams Head Plaza, Carrington Hall / Nursing School Addition, FedEx Global Education Center, Genome Sciences, Koury Oral Health Sciences, and the Loudermilk Center.

The Rams Head Complex, the Nursing School addition, the FedEx Global Education Center, and the Genome Sciences Building were each constructed on top of a former surface parking lot. So the impervious surface area at each site was reduced by constructing the building and incorporating a green roof. 

Located within a short walk of 8,000 residential students and most campus classrooms, Rams Head Center is part of the new connective tissue bridging South Campus and Main Campus. The facility boasts a grocery store, dining hall, recreation center, intensive green roof, and two large rainwater cisterns all built around a 700- space parking garage. 

Completed in 2005, the Nursing School addition was the first building in the UNC system to receive Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Its extensive green roof captures rain water, reduces stormwater runoff, and provides attractive views from adjacent offices.

Opened in 2007, the FedEx Global Education Center features two extensive green roofs, which contain drought-tolerant sedum gardens. The roofs minimize stormwater runoff, reduce the urban heat island effect, and provide an attractive view from the adjacent outdoor terrace.

The stormwater from that falls on the Rams Head Plaza buildings and the Fedex Global Education Center is also collected in cisterns. At Rams Head, the overflow from the intensive green roof passes through a bioswale on its way to an infiltration bed that underlies a recreation field. ","UNC has 12 porous pavement installations. Six installations occur at four park and ride parking lots that have infiltration/stone storage beds located beneath the pavement. These include: Estes Drive Extension parking lots (one permeable asphalt; one permeable concrete), the Park and Ride Lots next to the Friday Center on Highway 54 (one permeable asphalt; one permeable concrete), at the Hedrick building (permeable asphalt), and the Chatham County Park and Ride Lot (permeable asphalt). The NC Botanical Gardens Education Center (permeable interlocking concrete pavers) is a new highly visible site. Additional smaller parking installations have occurred at the McCauley Lot across from the Cheek-Clark Building (permeable asphalt), EPA Building (permeable asphalt), Baity Hill Residence Halls (permeable asphalt), and the Kenan/McIver Residence Halls (permeable asphalt).",,,"UNC has 17 ponds and wetlands. These are primarily dry detention basins located off main campus or on the southern edge of campus. These are under consideration for retrofit as wetlands or wet ponds. 

UNC also has 31 stormwater management practices that were designed for infiltration. Eight of these sites are also permeable pavement. The other sites are underground storage in conjunction with an underground stone bed designed for infiltration. While these are not ponds, they are considered ""retention."" 
","The University has one installation that is a vegetated swale designed for stormwater treatment. During heavy rains, water fills the cistern and vegetated roof system at the Rams Head Plaza and overflows into a vegetated swale. 

UNC also has six level spreaders, which are a form of vegetated conveyance. These spread water to promote sheet flow. Four level spreaders are located at the Baity Hill Residence Halls. One is located at the Francis Owen facility. One level spreader is located near the Giles Horney Building. 

The University's open channel conveyances include many vegetated and grassed swales. If these were not specifically constructed as a stormwater treatment practice, we do not inventory them as stormwater management. 

","Rainwater  collected from the roof of the Genome Sciences Building drains to a 350,000 gallon, stone-filled cistern beneath the Bell Tower Amphitheater. Following UV treatment and chlorination, the rainwater is used to flush 1000 toilets in the Genome Sciences Building and Kenan Stadium and to irrigate Kenan field. When rainwater is sufficient, reclaimed wastewater from OWASA provides a non-potable backup. Concrete vaults detain ground-level stormwater. Short-term storage reduces downstream erosion, flooding, and pollutant loading. 

Staff stormwater education and good practices: Stormwater staff from the UNC Department of Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) conduct periodic training for 950 UNC staff whose actions on the job influence water quality. This includes staff from the following departments: Grounds, Athletics, Facilities Maintenance, Housekeeping, Energy Services, Public Safety, Construction Shops, and Housing Support. Prior to the training, less than 25% of pollution reports came from outside of EHS. After the first round of training, more than 65% of pollution reports come from outside of EHS.

Mapping: UNC Energy Services has mapped the structural system in GIS, including the stormwater treatment practices, storm drain pipes, inlets, manholes, outfalls, and roof drains.

1) Screen development permits for post-construction stormwater management, conduct plan reviews, approve stormwater facilities, conduct inspections, and provide compliance enforcement as appropriate. 
2) Maintain an up-to-date Stormwater Management Manual for new development. 
3) Track, evaluate, and develop new technologies and practices for post-construction stormwater management. 
4) Provide training and technical assistance on water quality facilities to city staff and the public. 
5) Conduct a review of policies, practices and regulations to identify potential barriers to implementing low impact development techniques. 
They a) Review stormwater management proposals at the land use and/or development permit stage (i.e. earliest level of review) 
b) Review and approve construction plans for stormwater management facilities for all development sites which create 1000 square feet or more impervious surface. 
c) Update Eugene’s Stormwater Management Manual every two years or as needed to provide new information or practices for post-construction stormwater management.  

The Stormwater Management Manual may contain forms, maps and facility agreements and shall include requirements that are consistent with the following goals: 
(1) Reduce runoff pollution from development by reducing impervious surfaces and capturing and treating approximately 80% of the average annual rainfall. 
(2) Control and minimize flows from development in the Headwater Areas using a variety of techniques to release water to downstream conveyance systems at a slower rate and lower volume, thereby reducing the potential for further aggravation of instream erosion problems. 
(3) Emphasize stormwater management facilities that incorporate vegetation as a key element, and include design and construction requirements that ensure landscape plant survival and overall stormwater facility functional success. 
(4) Operate and maintain stormwater management facilities in accordance with facility-specific O & M Plans. 
(5) Reduce pollutants of concern that are generated by identified site uses and site characteristics that are not addressed solely through the stormwater quality measures by implementing additional specific source control methods including reducing or eliminating pathways that may introduce pollutants into stormwater, capturing acute releases, directing wastewater discharges and areas with the potential for relatively consistent wastewater discharges to the wastewater system, containing spills on site, and avoiding preventable discharges to wastewater facilities, surface waters or ground waters. 
(6) Except as otherwise allowed by this land use code, allow disturbances or development within drainage ways only when all of the following conditions exist: 
(a) The disturbance or development will not impede or reduce flows within the drainage way; 
(b) The disturbance or development will not increase erosion downstream; 
and (c) The constructed pipe system is sized to convey all of the runoff from the upstream watershed when the upstream watershed is completely developed. (Section 9.6790 added by Ordinance No. 20369, enacted June 14, 2006, effective July 14, 2006;

",TRUE,"Sustainable Development Water Goal: Improved Quality of Stormwater. The university will improve the quality of campus stormwater emitted into the region’s waterways by focusing on campus areas that contribute the most to the degradation of water quality—campus streets and parking lots. All development projects are required to treat the  equivalent amount of stormwater runoff as required by city code; however, some of the areas treated will be shifted outside the project site to address relatively low water quality campus areas—streets and parking lots. All development projects will treat stormwater run-off from a portion of an existing UO-owned street or parking area instead of treating the equivalent amount of relatively clean, on-site, impervious surfaces, primarily defined as pedestrian surfaces such as sidewalks (especially those that do not drain directly into a stormwater pipe). The same amount of impervious surface will be treated, but the dirtier surfaces will receive greater attention. For example, if a project site has 1,000 square feet of sidewalks that must be treated, the project would not be required to treat this area; instead, it would be required to fund 1,000 square feet of stormwater treatment for an existing campus street or parking lot. The cost to treat existing streets and parking areas is determined by establishing an average cost/square foot. The project is not responsible for identifying and implementing the off-site stormwater measures. Funds are deposited into a central fund earmarked for stormwater treatment measures. Campus Operations manages the fund and appropriately implements measures needed to equal the required stormwater treatment from all development projects. Projects should be designed to accommodate the potential to treat all of their stormwater in the future. This goal requires coordination with the city (and in some cases may preclude implementation of this policy).",5,"UO Eugene: The Student Rec.

Educational opportunities are made visible through a new information monitor showing how the rain collection system works. As people enter the building, they walk across a faint green line on the floor, outlining the shape of the old pool below. This simple gesture brings awareness to the transformation of adaptive reuse. ***An average year of rainfall (400,000 gal captured), provides the SRC with water for flushing toilets and irrigating their new landscape. If rainfall is low in any given year, recycled water is supplemented with regular water. The Outdoor Program Barn has permeable paving in the boat cleaning station and bike parking area and two 1,500 gallon cisterns that mitigate about 6,000 sq.ft. The cisterns collect seasonal rainwater from the rooftop of the building. The water is then used for flushing toilets, laundry and rinsing off rental boats. Permeable Paving allows rainfall and runoff water to infiltrate into the ground. Regarding satellite locations:  OIMB and UO Portland both have rainwater cisterns. White Stag has been getting 67% credit for stormwater managed onsite through Portland's Clean River Rewards Program: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/41976 ","UO Eugene has many vegetated bioswales on campus and new ones are installed as development evolves. 1) The Millrace bioswale pond was completed in 2001 and mitigates and area of 6,000 square feet.  It is a vegetated bioswale that directs some of the runoff from Franklin Blvd through a storm drain and empties into the bioswale where the water is filtered and cleaned. The water is then either absorbed into the ground, or conveyed through a set of basins and weirs before entering into the adjacent Millrace. Features similar native plantings as the ones found along the Millrace.   2) The Moss Street Children’s Center was completed in 2004 and is a vegetated bioswale runs through playground outside of building and mitigates ~20,000 sq. ft. The bioswale then directs water under a covered bridge and out to the entrance of the main building where the water has a chance to filtrate into the ground. Features native plantings that support wildlife habitat. 3) The Many Nations Longhouse bioswale and green roof bioswale was completed in 2005 and mitigates about 4,000 sq.ft.  The vegetated bioswale filters and cleans runoff from Columbia Street and adjacent parking lot. It features native plants that support wildlife habitat. The green roof (extensive) is beautifully planted with a prairie of native grasses and herbaceous perennials. It functions to absorb direct rainfall and the elevation of the vegetated rooftop provides an engaging view to users of the surrounding buildings.  4) The HEDCO Building was completed in 2009 and has a complex system that includes a bioswale, rain garden, roof garden, filtration beds and infiltration basins mitigating 173,303 sq.ft.  The vegetated bioswales filter and clean runoff from the main parking lot and underground garage. It features native plants that support wildlife habitat. The rain garden receives water from rooftops of buildings and walkway covers. Water is creatively directed into garden beds, densely planted with a variety of plantings. The filtration basins convey water from the building roof and filter through a series of planters.  A green roof (intensive) is located over garage and mainly functions to absorb direct rainfall and as a gathering space.   5) The Walnut Station Parking Lot was completed in 2010 and mitigates 39,457 sq.ft of impervious area and a total of 69,711 sq.ft total area. The Vegetated Bioswale filters and cleans runoff from parking lots and features native plantings that support wildlife habitat. 6) The Jaqua Academic Center has a bioswale path that was completed in 2010 and mitigates ~60,000 sq.ft.  The vegetated Bioswale filters and cleans runoff from the parking lot and features native plantings that support wildlife habitat. 7) The Northside Parking area has a vegetated bioswale that was competed in 2011 and mitigates 30,000 sq.ft.  The vegetated bioswale filters and cleans runoff from the parking lot and features native plantings that support wildlife habitat. 8) The Johnson Parking Lot has a vegetated bioswale that was completed in 2011 and mitigates ~6,000 sq.ft.  It filters and cleans runoff from Johnson Lane Parking Lot and features a lush grove of native plantings. 9) Allen Hall has a vegetated bioswale and flow-through planter that was competed in 2013. The flow through planter receives runoff from adjacent parking lot by means of scuppers that direct water into the planter. Runoff is absorbed and cleaned though plants and ground infiltration. It features native and horticultural plantings and a seating wall for users. 10) 15th Avenue flow through planters and seating that was completed in 2015 and mitigates~ 8,000sq.ft.  The Flow-Through Planters are integrated along 15th Street and in between parking areas. The sunken and walled planters filter and clean runoff from the road.

","Grassed swales drain most of the non-curbed roadways on campus and can be seen adjacent to these roadways, such as South Circle Drive. Grassed swales have the ability to treat stormwater and allow for infiltration, whereas the alternative storm sewer system does not. ","The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay storm sewer system was constructed in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s during the initial construction phases of the university. At that time, the City of Green Bay did not have storm sewers that extended to the campus site. In order to provide stormwater drainage for the campus area, storm sewers were installed that discharge to the nearby waters of Mahon Creek and the bay of Green Bay. Subsequent development necessitated drainage for a large part of campus that was provided by construction of storm sewers that lead to a pond on the golf course. The detention pond serving the Kress Events Center was constructed in 2007 to provide stormwater runoff pollution control for new parking lots and building expansion of the Kress Events Center. Over the years, the university has constructed and maintained a storm sewer system that is completely separate from the system operated by the City of Green Bay.

Current greenhouse water usage is as follows:

The water system that is in the greenhouse is a homemade watering tree, with 6 half round shrub nozzles installed on the tree.  There are two trees one for each room.  The values below are for both rooms.

½ round shrub nozzle = 1.3 gpm

1.3 gpm x 12 nozzles = 15.6 gpm

15.6 gpm x 10 min. watering cycle = 156 gallons of water per cycle.

156 gallons x 3 cycles a day = 468 gallons per day.

468 gallons per day x 7 days a week = 3,276 gallons per week.

3,276 gallons per week x 52 weeks per year = 170,352 gallons a year.

If we were to install a water recovery system at the green house we would greatly reduce the water consumption.  The values below show how much water could be recovered.

Water recovered from greenhouse coolers = .75 gpm

.75 gpm x 60 min = 45 gallons per hour.

45 gallons x 6 hr. average run time = 270 gallons per day.

270 gallons x 7 days a week = 1,890 gallons per week.

1,890 per week x 52 weeks = 98,280 per year of recovered water.

The average rainfall in Stockton is 14.06 inches per year.

The average size roof collects 600 gallons of water for every inch of rain.  When you think about it the greenhouse is not much smaller than your average home.  So with the information we should be able to recover 8,436 gallons of water from rain.

14.06 inches per year x 600 gallons an inch = 8,436 gallons per year of recovered rain water.

8,436 gallons per year of recovered rain water.  + 98,280 gallons per year of recovered cooler water = 106,716 gallons per year of recovered water.
