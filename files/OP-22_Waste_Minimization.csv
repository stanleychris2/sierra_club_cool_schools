In previous years, they used to have trays with the dining but after reconstructing the cafeteria they made sure that there would be no need for trays. Albion College basically designed the cafeteria at Baldwin for trayless dining. They did construction the time that they did because the freshmen class would not know the difference and wouldn’t care for trays. Unfortunately, the upperclassmen miss trayless dining because it is something they remember with the old cafeteria. With the new design at Baldwin and not using trays, we are saving energy because we are not using tons of water to clean trays. People will eat 10,000 meals a week. We want to be able to save up money and not use as much water which means if we do not use trays then that means less water we are using up with the amount of bowls, plates, spoons, etc. that people are using in the cafeteria.

The study examined municipal solid waste generated at the ASU main campus in Tempe, Arizona. The function of this exercise was to examine material generation and waste stream composition in order to reduce waste and improve operational efficiencies. A Waste Characterization Report was then developed to provide quantitative baseline data and observations about the material assessed.","Arizona State University’s Green Purchasing requirements mandate reduced packaging, and any packaging that is used must meet at least one of the following, and preferably all of the following: made from 100% post-consumer recycled materials, be recyclable, be reusable, be non-toxic, and be bio-degradable.  This requirement has reduced the amount of packaging material that arrives on campus.

Solicitations have specifications that suppliers must take away their packaging for large quantity equipment purchases.

ASU has moved completely away from broadloom carpeting to carpet tiles. We reduce waste by ordering only sections that need replacement.  All carpet suppliers are required to pick up old carpet tiles and recycle them.  (Also, broadloom inherently uses 15% to 20% more material, because of increased cutting and seaming to match patterns in irregular sized spaces.

In December 2009, ASU approved a Sustainable Design Policy to implement sustainable practices in the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of all university facilities.  The policy applies to all new construction and major renovations on all ASU campuses.  The guidelines provide direction in working toward the university’s goals of carbon neutrality, zero waste, active engagement and principled practice. Incorporated within this policy are the following waste reduction guidelines:

• Building Size & Footprint: Minimize the overall building size (square footage and footprint) while meeting the building program requirements.  The goal is efficient use of space to reduce overall resource consumption; including embodied energy, operational energy, and building materials.

• Design for Future Use: Plan for a “100-year Building” through flexibility of use and future reuse. Design interior spaces that are flexible and allow for changes in use.  Use standard furniture wherever possible. Minimize use of custom millwork, custom building systems (door frames, doors, interior windows etc.) to maximize reuse in the future.  For retrofits, analyze current space requirements for space efficiency, function, and use proximity.  Design in accordance with cradle to cradle principles to the full extent practical.

• Existing Landscaping: Protect significant natural and historic landscaping and incorporate those elements into the new landscape design.  Design to optimize a balance of water conservation and energy conservation.

• Reused and repurposed materials should be integrated into the building shell, structural materials, finishes, and fixtures when they can be used without compromising quality.  

• Construction Waste: Minimize or eliminate construction waste. Reduce, reuse and/or recycle waste materials to minimize disposal to a landfill.","Arizona State University has Surplus Property where retired items are sold or recycled. The University also has an online program called Surplus Exchange and Transfer that is a university-wide ""classified ad"" system for exchanging property.

In addition, the default setting for all computer lab printers is to print double sided. Further, the University introduced one-to-one computing four years ago. Most students purchase their own laptops with the needed software installed so that they rarely have to use a computer center.

In addition, Arizona State University signed a 20-year agreement with Canon to digitize the University. As a part of this initiative, Canon has inventoried all input/output devices on campus and is visiting with departments to show them how they can adopt the latest technology while reducing their costs by replacing many input/output devices with a few networked multi-function devices. Canon devices offer print reduction programs, are set to double side printing, provide scan to e-mail, and fax to file.","Ditch the Dumpster is an annual tradition. The year-end donation and recycling drive collects thousands of pounds of reusable and recyclable items from students as they move out of ASU residence halls. Reusable items are donated to charity organizations that benefit children and families locally. Items that cannot be reused are repurposed or recycled. Ditch the Dumpster is a university-wide initiative, consisting of several cross-functional departments and a third-party non-profit organization. Donation bins are designated at each residence hall approximately 3 weeks prior to semester's end; non-profit staff picks up donations on a daily basis.

When an asset is no longer of use to a department, ICM determines the proper disposition of the item according to university policy.  This process includes both capitalized and tracked assets (those with inventory control tags) and non-capitalized or non-tracked equipment (those with no inventory control tags).  ICM stores excess property in a central warehouse and attempts to assist other campus departments in reusing goods and equipment.

To obtain equipment from excess the requesting department must call ICM .  If there is an asset that matches the requesting department description, ICM will arrange for the department to view the asset at the warehouse. A B-450 Capital Release/Move Order form will be prepared by ICM and the inventory system will be updated to reflect the new custodial department.  The release of excess will be authorized by the Manager of ICM.  Items in the warehouse will be made available to campus departments for university use at no charge to the requesting department.  Material or equipment that is of no further value to the University as determined by the Director of Purchasing & Central Stores and the Manager of Inventory Control & Moving will be sold at public auction.  Items remaining are assessed for recycling. ","The university has eliminated the practice of large hard-copy production runs of course catalogs in favor of on-line  course catalogs for undergraduate and graduate course offerings, and has moved to electronic course registration, course evaluation and course-grade filing. 

This has had influence on other practices throughout the campus (see ""submission notes above"")","Ball State University limits free printing.   Students, faculty, and staff may print up to 500 black and white pages (one side of one sheet of paper) from printers at the university Library.  After reaching the 500 page limit a $.05 per page charge is applied and charged through the Bursar's Office.  Additionally, the university recently removed printing capabilities in most computers labs (i.e., students can no longer print in most computer labs) on campus to reduce paper waste and save the university money.  The university is recommending several alternatives to traditional printing. 
See http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/Libraries/ComputersPrinting/Printing.aspx.  

“Help reduce our footprint on the environment by printing your documents to portable document files (PDFs) saved to your computer or iLocker space. Printing digital files reduces the amount of paper and ink we use each day, reducing our impact on the environment. If you are using a Mac, your system comes ready to print PDFs. If you are using a Windows PC, download and install free ePrint software to easily create PDFs. www.bsu.edu/eprint  Look for the iScan stations in the computer labs and Bracken Library, or use the scanners in residence hall computer labs to scan your paper documents directly into your iLocker digital storage space www.bsu.edu/ilocker. In other words, ePrint software allows you to save paper by printing to a PDF rather than to paper. The PDF can then be stored electronically in such places as your iLocker account, flash drive, or the hard drive of your computer.”
","The Office of Housing and Residence Life, in collaboration with Facilities and Planning Management (FPM), creates collection sites for items that can be reused or recycled by the institution in order to reduce move-out waste.  FPM collects cardboard, lumber, and blocks/concrete bricks at eight housing locations during move-out periods.  These areas are easily identifiable with orange or black construction fence material and signage. 
•	Woodworth, Park, and DeHority – grassy area by the Woodworth loading dock 
•	Noyer- east side lawn area
•	Lafollette - north side of the loading dock by the extra roll-off.
•	Studebaker West – grassy area by bike racks towards Stu East.
•	Johnson A - by the loading dock
•	Johnson B - by the loading dock
•	Elliott - on the south side by the parking area 
•	Kinghorn – back of the building towards the parking lot

FPM staff pick up items from these sites twice per day with an extra pick up on Saturday morning prior to graduation.  The collection sites are typically setup by May 2nd, and announcements of the event are posted two weeks prior.  Additional recycling collection sites are created inside the halls to collect plastics, aluminum, steel cans, and paper.  The Office of Housing and Residence Life also coordinates with their Hall Directors to designate donation collection sites in each hall for non perishable foods, clothing, small appliances, textbooks and unopened toiletries.  The custodial staff of each building removes and stores donation items on a daily basis to prevent theft of items and to prevent unsightly overflow.  Typically the donation sites within the buildings are setup two weeks prior to graduation. The donated items are given to the local Muncie Mission Ministries.  See website http://www.munciemission.org/  The move-out donation sites last year collectively diverted 11,562 pounds of material from the landfill. 

The student-led Golden Key Honor Society at Ball State University also sets up ten used book collection sites in partnership with Better World Books (http://www.betterworldbooks.com) several weeks prior to move-out and graduation.  The locally-donated books are re-used, re-sold and recycled to benefit global literacy programs - keeping books out of the local waste stream.  In the past several years, the Golden Key Honor Society has collected roughly 882 books, keeping 1,200 pounds of material out of the local landfill.

The clear containers also give chefs the opportunity to provide feedback to Dining Services' cooks on how to reduce trimming and prep waste.","All residential dining halls are trayless since 2008. The majority of food is also made to order, in order to further reduce waste, and we offer smaller plates and portion sizes for many dishes in our residential dining locations. ","At BU's main food court, customers are given the option of using reusable tableware, BPI-certified compostable to-go tableware or a reusable to-go container.  Residential dining halls use exclusively reusable tableware. At several other smaller retail locations on campus, compostable to-go containers are used as well.  Reusable to-go containers are available for purchase at the student union since September 2011 and can be used at the food court. Customers using the reusable to-go containers are given a $0.25 discount each time it is used. Most other retail locations on campus use BPI-certified compostable tableware, with the exception of some of our national brands. They are used in conjunction with a post-consumer composting program.","All residential dining halls use exclusively reusable dishware.  
Several food containers, napkins, boxed lunches, takeout containers as well as Starbucks cups use post-consumer recycled content. The majority of disposable tableware (about 90%) purchased at Boston University is compostable and biobased; the rest is recyclable.  Twelve out of fourteen locations that offer compostable disposables offer post-consumer composting. Polystyrene was eliminated from campus in 2008.",Dining Services offers a $0.25 reusable mug discount at every coffee-serving location on campus. This discount applies to all drip coffee and tea. A $0.25 discount is also offered for customers that use our reusable to-go container.,"All of our staffed catered events on campus are Zero Waste. That means that our compostable tableware is collected on tray stands on the floor of the event instead of trash cans, and retrieved and sorted by our trained waitstaff in the back of the event, between compost and recycling. Very little trash is generated at events. This practice is used across campus, throughout the year, for all size events ranging from 5 to 5,000 people.",http://www.bu.edu/sustainability/what-were-doing/waste-reduction/,"While figures entered for the ""Weighted Campus Users"" calculations are from FY06, sustainability@BU was only able to collect CY06 data for ""waste generated.""

In order to reduce waste, the campus reduced its number of external trash cans and repurposed five of those trash cans into recyling receptacles.
2. Representatives of STORC are routinely invited to glean items from the Facilities Management ""boneyard"" for reuse and upcycling at STORC. For example, bathroom stall dividers that were destined for recycling were upcycled to create compost bins for STORC.
3. The University has employed an award-winning Take Back program that has allowed the campus community to bring in personal items for recycling for which the University either bears no cost to recycle or is compensated monetarily.
4. Sac State Sustainability conducts two 'Recycle-It-All at Sac State' events--one in the Fall and one in the Spring. At these events, the campus community is encouraged to bring in various items for recycling at no cost to them.
5. Sac State Sustainability has restructured many of its waste contracts to facilitate more opportunities for recycling or waste diversion, e.g., specifications that all green waste be diverted from landfills and food composting be an option provided by the waste hauler.
6. Organic waste is routinely donated to STORC for composting purposes.
7. Over the past couple of years, recycling options have been offered for more items previously not recyclable.
8. Sac State Sustainability has aggressively pursued online avenues such as social media and its website as a means to further promote updates and information about recycling to the campus community.
9. Sac State Sustainability has participated in ""Game Day Recycling"" and ""RecycleMania.""
10. In addition to redistributing equipment and furniture, Property Management now conducts public auctions of excess furniture and equipment.
11. Sac State Sustainability has teamed up with California Product Stewardship Council (CPSC) to implement the ""Don't Rush to Flush"" and ""Refuel Your Fun"" campaigns on the Sac State campus. ""Don't Rush to Flush"" is a pharmaceutical take-back program and ""Refuel Your Fun"" offers the option of renting reusable propane tanks rather than purchasing single-use propane tanks.
12. Sac State Sustainability is committed to composting its green waste onsite as much as is possible.
13. Policies have been set in place to maximize the purchasing of recycled paper.
14. Campus has continued to utilize deskside mini trash bins in an effort to instill in its customers the idea that most of their waste should be recycled.
15. Recycling has employed the use of infographics and posters to educate the campus community about what is recyclable.
16. The Recycling Coordinator has participated in several interviews, speeches, and other engagements to help educate the campus community about recycling and waste diversion.
17. In 2015, the campus' first-ever large-scale zero-waste event was conducted (the Clean Air Partnership Awards Luncheon).
18. Long before local and state regulations required it, the Union Store stopped automatically offering plastic bags to its customers in an effort to reduce plastic bag waste.
19. Many of the campus eateries no longer offer Styrofoam to-go containers.
20. The campus has removed much of its grassy turf in favor of nonorganic materials. Though this was done to conserve water, it has the added benefit of reducing the campus green waste.","1. Dining Services audits the billing for all post-consumer food waste collected from the Dining Commons to note trends in program participation among students and diners in the Dining Commons. They also audit the billing to keep track of the amount of said material that is being collected.
2. Dining Commons employees audit the waste stream on a daily basis to ensure that only post consumer food waste is collected. This is important since the waste is going to a facility to make Bio Compacted Natural Gas and needs to be free of contaminants.
3. A student conducted an audit of the contents of the trash at our Dining Commons facility to determine how much food was thrown away as trash.
4. Two students conducted an audit of the campus' numerous eateries and coffee houses to determine how much pre-consumer, post consumer, and mixed pre and post consumer food was thrown away on daily and weekly basis.
5. The Sustainability Department conducted a general audit of 50+ of the campus' external refuse bins to determine what was being thrown away, including to what extent food was being tossed.
6. In March, April, and part of May 2014, the Recycling Department collected used coffee grounds from the University’s coffee houses and audited for location and weight of those collections. From March 11th through May 2nd over 2000 lbs. of used coffee grounds were collected from the coffee houses. The most came from the Library Java City at 605 lbs.  All materials were added to an on-site mulch pile to be used on campus to enhance the greenery.","1. The campus' STORC facility (Sustainable Technologies Optimization Research Center) collects preconsumer waste from many of the campus' eateries and also from the campus Children's Center which generates preconsumer waste when creating snacks and lunch for its young students.
2. The campus' Consumer Sciences Department also has its left over grease recycled at STORC which uses it to create bio-diesel.
3. Used coffee grounds from the campus coffee houses are collected in the campus' Grounds to Grounds program to be used to promote composting.","1. All post-consumer food waste collected by the Dining Commons is collected and sent to a local facility called Clean World to be upcycled into BioCompacted Natural Gas (BioCNG). This BioCNG is also what fuels our Hornet bus shuttle system. This has resulted in nearly 27 tons diverted from the landfill in the program's first semester of existence.
2. Also at the Dining Commons, in an effort to reduce the amount of food students serve themselves, trayless dining has been implemented. Without trays, students are less inclined to over-serve themselves.
3. In order to track the amount of post-consumer waste generated on campus, two students conducted an audit of the campus' eateries and coffee houses to determine how much product was generated on a daily and weekly basis.
4. A student conducted an audit of the amount of post-consumer food collected in the campus' Dining Commons.","1. Most of the campus eateries have switched to some form of compostable to-go containers from Styrofoam containers. As of this writing, only three of the University's eateries still use Styrofoam.","1. Every student in residence at the University's Housing Dept. is given a reusable to-go container for food, a reusable cup, and a reusable bag to carry everything in. These reusables can be used at the campus Dining Commons where students can use these items to pick up their food to go. This is part of a larger plan to institute a similar program at other campus eateries.
2. At Housing's ""Block Party"" event, which is an event to initiate students to housing life, Dining Services gave away over 700 reusable Starbucks mugs for students to use at campus coffee houses.
3. All serveware used for dine-in meals at the Dining Commons is reusable.","1. Each coffee house on campus offers a $0.25 discount for any student, faculty, or staff who uses a reusable mug.","1. Used cooking oil from many of the campus eateries are taken to the STORC where they are upcycled into biodiesel. Whatever used oil/rendering collected that is in excess of the wants and needs of the STORC is collected and given to a local rendering company.
2. New water, and energy-efficient, dish washing equipment was installed in the dining commons. 
3. In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Dining Services has committed to purchase at least 25% of its produce locally.
4. In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in 2015, campus eatery Epicure, in an effort to cater a zero-waste event, committed to using salad green grown onsite at the university STORC. Additionally, a portion of the event's pre-consumer food waste went back to the STORC for composting.",http://www.csus.edu/sustainability,"other websites include:

","Student waste monitors sort waste weekly to determine the proportion of contaminated bins, and what percentage of the waste stream is compostable, recyclable or waste.  They produce signage for residence halls which reports each dorm's performance relative to others.  This data was also recently used in a statistics consulting course at Carleton.","In 2014, Carleton started working with Cort Furniture to manage visiting faculty apartment furniture. The program works such that when the college no longer needs the furniture, it is reused by other subscribers. This limits the amount of furniture that is purchased and thrown away.



",The Carleton Office Supply Swap is housed in the sustainability office.  Staff and faculty can drop off unwanted supplies or pick up things they need at no charge.  A sign-in sheet tracks usage. ,"Carleton's course catalog is available online and registration is an online process.  The Carleton online directory is the primary source for staff, faculty and student directory information, there are no printed faculty/staff directories.","Carleton recently implemented PaperCut as its print management solution in the fall of 2012. The program charges $0.04 for white and black and $0.15 for color per page. Students start off each academic year with a $30 credit, meaning the first 750 white and black pages are free until students begin to pay out of their own pocket.","Carleton has the ""Lighten Up Garage Sale"" at the end of every year, where the ACT (Acting in the Community together) center organizes drop-off receptacles for students' unwanted possessions. The resulting sale generates profits for local charities. In addition, Carleton has a tri-weekly newsletter called the NNB (Noon News bulletin) in which students can put free ads for items that they are looking to buy, sell or give away. We do not measure the weight of donated or reused items, however the quantity is very high.",Our ITS purchases electronics with minimal packaging where possible.,In winter of 2013 sustainability assistants and volunteers measured the amount of food waste produced by students during one week. There is no systematic waste audit conducted by Bon Appétit. Bon Appétit occasionally weighs the food waste produced by their food preparers and chefs to minimize the amount of food waste produced (such as peals etc).,"As stated above, the audit that Bon Appétit completed of their staff sought to reduce food waste. 
For outdoor events, BA manages the number of buffet lines so that food does not become stranded and wasted (they also limit the number of trays of produce they put out by placing only one type of vegetable on each tray). Additionally, leftovers from menu items are planned into the subsequent day's menu, and soups are frozen or transported to Carleton's cafe for the next day's meal. Broths are created from the stock of vegetables that would otherwise be disposed.","Through a student-led initiative, Carleton instituted trayless dining in one of its two campus dining halls.  The program began as ""Trayless Tuesdays"" in the 2010-2011 academic year and was expanded by student referendum to ""Trayless Everyday"" for the 2011-2012 academic year and beyond.  The program applies to student dining, not the two commercial cafes. There are structural contraints to making the second dining hall trayless.
The Food Recovery Program operated through the CCCE collects and delivers food from the dining halls to the local food pantry. ","In fall of 2014 a reusable cup program will be instituted in the dining halls to replace paper take-out cups. In our cafe, this project has been discussed, but as of yet, there have been no economically viable alternatives to the compostable to-go containers that are currently in use.","Carleton uses metal reusable silverware for dine in meals and ""Eco Products"" plant based plastic compostable silverware for to-go meals. They are BPI certified.","Patrons in our cafes can purchase a drink for $1.25 (no matter what size) with use of a reusable mug.  Without the discount, a large is $1.80 and a small is $1.44.",,https://apps.carleton.edu/sustainability/campus/waste/,"2005 data was not tracked and is extrapolated.  Carleton's waste stream is measured on a volume basis, so compost, recycling and landfill waste weights are rough estimates.

Carleton students and the institution donate, reuse and resell a huge number of goods. Unfortunately, due to the high volume and the difficulty of weighing all those items, we are unable to say how many tons we divert each year."

We identify where they were collected from and weigh them.  Each location is sorted into categories; trash, paper, bottles & cans, or composting and weighed again.  We calculate the results and design a graph showing how much could have been recycled and diverted from the landfill.  We usually find that 30% of what is thrown into the trash could have been diverted.","Procurement includes language in contracts to services providers that requires recycling the 'waste' from the project or service.  For example; carpet, scrap metal or shipping cardboard recycling is required.","The university's warehouse staff manages campus office furniture storage and exchanges. Departmental Facilities Coordinators share information with each other about surplus they have available. Several departments have 'free tables' or 'office surplus zones' in their departments to share surplus supplies internally.

Food waste sources for the audit at the UC included three food preparation kitchens, three food distribution locations.  In preparation for the audit, orientation and training was conducted for 40 dining staff, food vendors participating in the audit, and 3 student volunteers.  

During the audit period an average of 358.33 lbs per day of “green” food waste, and
284.66 lbs per day of “yellow” food waste were collected. 

This regional feasibility study helped lead the way for a commercial food composting to begin a business in 2008.

The number of pages that a student has printed is tracked through their student username when they log onto the network. Any additional pages that a student needs may be printed for a small fee per page.,"Recycling opportunities are available for students in areas with designated bins for food, clothing, and school supplies. The housekeeping department makes special pick-ups of cardboard recycling during this time.

Through the Office of Residence Life (ORL), the university encourages a socially responsible clean up during move-out.

The servery uses half-pans for lines so that we will be able to donate any unused food.  By collaborating with Parkhurst Dining Services on food waste reduction efforts, we have fine-tuned the quantities of food put out during meal service so that there is very little extra for disposal.","Chatham ran a pilot program called “Trayless Tuesdays” in 2008, and it was so successful that the university fully implemented a completely trayless system in 2009.  Currently, 99% of all meals served on campus are trayless.  This includes meal plan meals, retail facility meals, and conference meals.  The new system appears to have no disadvantages.  In addition to using less water, soap, and labor to clean the trays, Chatham has seen enormous reductions in post-consumer food waste.  Before the trayless system was used, dining hall patrons filled four to five 55-gallon containers with food waste per meal period.  After going trayless, only half of one 55-gallon container is filled per meal.

Since its first effort in 2008, the program has evolved from grassroots dumpster diving into a well-known structured campaign. It's not just about saving items from the landfill, it's about collecting items to donate to local organizations and helping those in need in our community. The success of Campus Salvage depends on your donations!
During Move-Out in the Spring semester, the Campus Salvage Program sets out PODS across campus to accept unwanted items from students, staff and faculty at the end of the school year. More than half of the items we collect are donated to local organizations in need. The rest is sold at a community sale to pay for the costs to place the PODS on campus and help provide funding to the CCU Student Green Fund.  
In 2014 we were able to donate 9.54 tons of clothing and food to the local community from this event.

(Move In) About the Program Students moving onto campus bring lots of items, including cardboard boxes. Every year, during Move-In Weekend, students and their families have the opportunity to recycle vast amounts of cardboard. Designated cardboard locations are set-up throughout the residence halls on main campus and University Place.
In 2014 we were able to recycle 9.92 tons of cardboard during move-in weekend.

Waste audits were conducted during week-long periods during fall term 2014 and 2015. All discarded resources, including recycled materials, were weighed and sorted. The particular audit week was selected because it occurred near midterm, which can better serve as a representative sample time than at the beginning or end of terms or during breaks. We feel comfortable using fall term as a sample time because waste produced during winter break is significantly lower than average while waste produced during the summer is increased due to special programing. 
","A week-long waste audit (the Discarded Resource Audit and Awareness Project) was conducted in October of 2014 and 2015.

The receptacles are labeled ""Recycling,"" ""Compost,"" and ""Landfill"" in order to make people more aware of where their non-recycled/non-composted waste goes. These receptacles are prototypes for campus-wide waste centers to be implemented in the future. ",," The team at Bon Appetit works hard every day to train and monitor food production in the CC kitchens every day. It conducts daily meetings with its staff to discuss food, safety and upcoming events.  These meetings often times includes the chefs pulling the compost containers located at each prep station to discuss the level of food scraps, how the cooks can utilize product better and which vegetable scraps can be utilized in our house made soup stock.  This program has shown great rewards in that Bon Appetit see very little unusable produce scrap being sent to compost.  Its chefs and staff rotate stock daily under the first in, first out model of food usage.

FY92 was chosen as a baseline year to accurately reflect the reductions in waste & gains in recycling & compost made on campus. FY92 was the first year for which there is accurate data for waste streams on campus.,"The university conducts a waste audit every year in conjunction w/ RecycleMania.  An entire truckload of trash is dumped on the plaza and volunteers (students & staff) sort it to better understand what is still in our waste stream. Specific weights are gathered to record what percentage of materials in the trash could have been recycled, composted, or donated.",,"Surplus Property, an institution on campus, is responsible for the handling and disposition of all property that the University no longer has a use for.  Their main objective is to provide an opportunity for the reallocation of still-usable items from one area of the University to other areas that have a need for them.  In addition, an outlet for the disposal of property that the University no longer has a use for is provided either through weekly walk-in sales to the public, vehicle auctions and surplus auctions as needed, or recycling for items that no longer have a market value.  Unfortunately, Surplus Property has no mechanism to weigh items moved through their facility.  As a result, those numbers are not included above.  
","The University uploads almost everything from policy handbooks, to maps, to course catalogs online. Printed materials are only produced upon request and at a fee. Some materials, such as the (sizeable) course catalog, are no longer available in print.
","All printing labs set limits on printing per student except for the main library where students must pay for individual printing. The exact limits are defined by the colleges each semester.
","In an effort to divert solid waste from the landfills, unwanted items are collected by CSU's Integrated Solid Waste Department, the Live Green Team, and the Eco Leaders during residence hall move out. Items collected include clothing, shoes, towels, dishes, lamps, desks, couches, coffee pots, plants, and more. The program, called ""Leave it Behind"" collects more than 20 tons of items that are then sold in a community sale during Ram Orientation in the summer to encourage incoming students to bring used items rather than purchasing new. The proceeds help support the Eco Leaders Program.

In Spring 2014, we piloted a program to make Leave It Behind available to off campus students as well as on campus students. There are plans to expand efforts for off campus students next year.","During Move-In each year, the Eco Leaders host Cardboard Corrals to collect boxes during move-in, most of which would be thrown away without this very visible collection program. In Fall 2014, more than 21 tons of boxes were collected for recycling.",Once each semester the Green Guard and the Eco Leaders conduct a plate waste audit in all of the dining centers on campus to track the amount of plate waste per student. An educational campaign and display is used to help engage students.,,"All on campus dining centers are tray-free.  

Over 11,000 meals are served every day in CSU dining centers. Not washing and sanitizing over 50,000 trays per week saves an estimated 195,000 gallons of water every month in addition to a reduction in dish-washing chemicals and energy usage. 

Trays of prepared food that are not served at the end of each meal period are donated to the Larimer County Food Bank. In 2013, over 60,000 pounds of food were donated.","Free Rental Rubbermaid containers are available at all dining facilities. Students can check the Rubbermaid containers out at any dining center and return them dirty. Housing and Dining Services takes care of cleaning and restocking  them.

All to-go products are compostable, from a local company called Eco-Products. This includes everything from the compartment food containers, to-go cups, lids, straws, silverware, etc. CSU also provides composting bins in two locations to collect to-go containers and close the loop. The compostable to-go containers are fed through the pulper, which collects all food waste, paper waste and some cardboard from the dining center. The materials from the pulper  are taken to an in-vessel composter on the Foothills Campus (three miles west of main campus).  The finished compost is returned to campus for use in campus landscaping projects. The composting rate for the dining centers was 92% in FY14.

CATS Program:
The Cornell Assets Transfer System (CATS) run by the Division of Financial Affairs - Cost and Capital Assets Department. This system is intended for items with a value exceeding $5,000 (though often used for items under $5,000), and is designed to connect those with available campus assets with those who can put the assets to further use. The Office of Community Relations coordinates equipment requests from the off-campus community where it is appropriate for assets to be gifted to an individual or outside agency. 

STACS Program:
R5 Operations manages both the System for Trade and Auction of Cornell Surplus (STACS) and the Facilities Services Reuse Program. As items are collected for disposal R5 Operations appropriately sorts furniture and office supplies for use by University Departments, for sale to the general public, and for the annual Dump and Run sale organized by Campus Life. 

Sedgwick Business Interiors Asset Inventory Management (AIM) program:
AIM Program inventories all furniture for an account/project.  The Sedgwick project team generates a customized Internet based asset inventory (AIM) list of all items stored. Items cataloged are rated as to their present condition to be used as a reference when items are re-deployed to other areas. 
AIM allows users to view all reserved, stored product online for future moves and reconfigures, leaving anything un-used stored. By managing active customer inventory, through reliable consistent information, better utilization of assets may be achieved and less product will be purchased; customer standards may be identified and managed, allowing for reduction in asset levels and customer storage costs.
Current accounts/projects on the Cornell campus include those in the College of Human Ecology, the Statler Hotel, Campus Life, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and more.

Donations:
Donations of Cornell owned items are coordinated by the Department of Community and Government Relations.

Human Services Coalition Listserv:
The mission of the Human Services Coalition is to identify information and service needs, to provide planning and coordination, and to enhance the delivery of health and human services in the Tompkins County area.
The listserv is open to persons who are affiliated with the non-profit sector. This may include employees or volunteers at not-for-profit agencies, county and city departments, elected officials, board members, or other affiliates. An award by the Appalachian Regional Commission to the Tompkins County Collaborative Communications Project, in cooperation with Cornell University, provided funding for this service.

Student and staff volunteers collect items students might otherwise throw away when leaving campus in May, sort and organize the collected items over the summer, and resell them at a large community sale when students return in August.

Items are collected from both university owned residence halls and apartments, as well privately owned apartments and houses. Items collected include clothing, shoes, organizational units, working appliances and electronics, furniture, sporting items, coat hangers, decorations, new toiletries, non-perishable food, text books, etc.

Proceeds from each Dump & Run sale are donated to local nonprofit organizations. This year's sale will benefit Cops, Kids & Toys; Greater Ithaca Activities Center (GIAC); Loaves & Fishes; Shelter Outreach Services, Finger Lakes ReUse, and United Way of Tompkins County.

Since Cornell's Dump & Run program began in 2003, the university's program has contributed more than $275,000 to Ithaca-area charities.  In 2013, 30 tons of reusable iitems were diverted from landfills.

This study consisted of (1) measuring students’ food waste over the course of a week to obtain baseline values, (2) following-up with an online survey to identify individuals’ behaviors, and (3) educating students about the implications of wasting food through a poster campaign.

The SSCs found that the average Cornell student wastes 3.2 oz of food per night. This equates to about 152 lbs per night, or 744 lbs for an entire week at one dining hall (Appel’s Market Eatery). At a larger, more frequented dining hall (Robert Purcell’s Market Eatery), the total waste is about two times this amount (1,488 pounds per week).

Out of the total number of students sampled, about 25% of the students wasted 5 ounces of food or more per meal. These students accounted for over half of the total waste. Additionally, the people who wasted over 10 oz. of food per night, accounted for a very large portion of the total waste (12%). 

Most of the survey responses indicated that students leave food on their plates because they didn't like the way food tasted or they took more than they could eat. ","Cornell Dining offers a “cook on demand” option, where students can request meals and watch as their food is prepared. For example, some All You Care to Eat Dining Facilities are equiped with an omelet bar, where students choose their own ingredients prior to the omelet’s creation. A similar program is used to make sandwiches, burritos, quesadillas, and salads in Dining’s retail locations.

Compost is collected widely across campus and processed on campus at an industrial size compost facility.
","Cornell Dining sells reusable mugs at four retail locations. Cornell Dining has a discount refill program.  A customer can bring in any reusable mug and get a 45-cent discount per drink. At one retail unit (Martha’s Café), Dining offers a ""free coffee"" program 5 mornings a week. Most student customers bring their own mugs to this coffee stand, rather than paying 25 cents for a cup. 

The Johnson Graduate School of Management has a daily coffee hour where students may obtain coffee at no charge with a reusable mug (disposable cups are not offered - students wishing to participate without a mug need to purchase a disposable cup from the nearby dining facility).","Cornell Catering offers compostable flatware, cups, plates, and napkins as well as compost bins and compost bin removal at end of catered events.

These are voluntary to use in the Union Station, but are required for hot entrees and soup in the Grab & Go.Hot entrée and soup options require the purchase and exchange of Dining Services-issued ecotainers. Below are directions on purchasing and return of ecotainers:

Grab & Go instructions:
Step 1:

Join our ecotainer program. A one-time fee will be assessed per container. Containers are made of polypropylene and are BPA-free. These containers can be purchased at the entrance to Grab & Go.

Costs: Entrée container ($4.50), soup container ($2.85)

Please note: These prices are at cost to Dining Services. It is not our intent to profit from the sale of containers.

Step 2:
Receive your ecotainers and enjoy this dining option.

Step 3:
Return your used ecotainers to Dining Services to be cleaned. Ecotainers will be collected by the exit door of the Dining Hall. Signs will be posted directing you to the drop-off location. Dining Services will wash and care for the ecotainers.

Step 4:
Receive a wooden nickel from the individual collecting ecotainers. This nickel will be a placeholder until the next time you need an ecotainer.

Step 5:
To receive a clean ecotainer, present your wooden nickel to the Grab & Go staff.

Frequently asked questions about the ecotainer program:

Will other takeout containers be available if I don't buy into the program?
Answer: These offerings are only available to those who commit to this sustainable initiative.

May I bring my own containers?
Answer: Only Dining Services issued containers may be used for this program.

What items are you serving in Grab & Go?
Answer: Daily menus will be posted outside Grab & Go.

Reducing unnecessary waste at the source allows the University to both mitigate the inefficient use of our natural resources and benefit economically from decreased handling and disposal costs.

Procurement activity may include:

- Institute practices that reduce waste, resulting in the purchase of fewer products whenever practicable and cost-effective, but without reducing safety or workplace quality.
- Purchase remanufactured products such as laser toner cartridges, tires, furniture, equipment and automotive parts whenever practicable, but without reducing safety, quality or effectiveness.
- Consider short-term and long-term costs in comparing product alternatives. Include evaluation of total costs expected during the time a product is owned, including, but not limited to, acquisition, extended warranties, operation, supplies, maintenance, disposal costs and expected lifetime compared to other alternatives.
- Purchase products that are durable, long lasting, reusable or refillable.
- Request that vendors eliminate packaging or use the minimum amount necessary for product protection to the greatest extent practicable.
- Request packaging that is reusable, recyclable or compostable when suitable uses and programs exist.
- Reuse pallets and packaging materials.
- Require that all equipment bought after the adoption of this Policy, when practicable, be compatible with products and services that provide source reduction benefits.

Based on recommendations from Duke Student Government and Students for Sustainable Living, Duke's Office of Information Technology is making changes to the ePrint student quota system, which is designed to encourage reasonable, sustainable printing habits.  

Duke students receive an allocation of $32 per semester in black-and-white laser printing at OIT's ePrint stations in libraries, computer labs, and public spaces. If your balance falls below $9, you can request an increase to your printing allocation of $8. Undergraduate students may request this increase only once per semester. If you exhaust your allocation, your print jobs will be charged to your FLEX account at $0.04 per sheet.  

The free allotment is the equivalent of 1,000 sheets (or 2,000 sheets if you print double-sided) per semester per student. The per-sheet rate is based on OIT calculations of the actual cost of printing.  The recommendations for these quotas and fees were developed by Duke's Students for Sustainable Living, with the goal of reducing students' impact on the environment and decreasing Duke's role in the overconsumption of trees and the energy and water used in the production of paper. Those recommendations were approved by the Duke Student Government Senate in April 2014.

Emory Recycles has also partnered with various departments  such as the library's preservation department, to find ways to recycle the unique waste that comes from those departments.","In spring 2014, Emory Dining launched a pilot waste management system in Cox Hall, the food court available to the entire Emory community. During this pilot, landfill trash cans have been removed, and regular audits of the compost/recycle bins are conducted by Emory Recycles and by the compost/recycle vendor so that Emory can improve its education regarding the most common contaminants. An audit of the waste streams from Cox Hall was conducted in June 2014.

We cannot use FY 2007 as the baseline as we have for other credits because we don't have waste data from that year. ,"Multiple waste audits are performed throughout the year by two particular groups. A professor in the biology department usually covers solid waste as a component of his class and has his students perform an audit of every bag coming out of the residence halls on particular days of the week. Each bag is weighed and the estimated percentage of garbage, paper, tissue paper, and bottles/cans is recorded. In FY 2015, the professor has hired two URAs (undergraduate research assistants) to carry out these audits. Additionally, the sustainability office periodically does a smaller scale audit for the dual purpose of collecting data and making waste visible.

The sort is done outside in front of the student center and passers-by are encouraged to participate. The most recent sustainability office trash sort was done in the fall of 2013, and the most recent audit was done in 2014. Results from the 2014 audit suggest that only 6.3% of the waste found in bags (by volume) should actually go to the landfill. The rest could be diverted with better education and collection systems.","The office of student involvement and the sustainability office run a program called Event Certification, where student clubs can apply for a certification similar to LEED that applies to their event. A large portion of the points are allocated based on students designing their event to minimize the creation of waste. They can get points for minimizing what they purchase, only purchasing items that can be recycled, and providing well marked recycling/composting receptacles at their events. The applications are reviewed by members of the student involvement and sustainability office, recommendations are made to improve the environmental impact of the events, and then students are awarded certification which allows them to use a logo on all marketing material with their level of rating. To aid the program, the sustainability office rents out reusable plates and bowls to student clubs for free.

Employees are strongly encouraged to obtain office supplies from the campus Freepo when they need anything rather than purchase new supplies. New hires receive information about the Freepo and other sustainability services in the online packet they are offered to help them navigate the campus.

Chartwells (dining services) purchases ""compostable"" dinnerware for all special events, for which reusable dinnerware is difficult to use. These are generally not composted on campus, but they will break down faster in the landfill stream than traditional disposable ware. In 2014, Chartwells began offering reusable to-go-containers. All new students since Fall of 2014 were given a free to-go container during orientation and current students were able to buy a to-go container for a one-time charge of $6.50. After the purchase, students, staff, and faculty can turn in a plastic card and get the reusable container and then dropped it off when they are done, at which point they'll be given a card again.","GMC offers a Freestore of reclaimed items in the basement of the Withey student center. Students, staff, and faculty can ""shop"" at the Freestore Monday through Friday. GMC also offers a Freepo full of used office supplies in the basement of the administrative building, Pollock. Both stores are free to members of the GMC community and accept donations of second-hand items. The stores are stocked regularly from free boxes that are located all around campus (one on each floor in the residence halls). Sustainability office workers collect these boxes when they get full and stock them in the store. They also keep the stores organized and market them using Facebook and Twitter. See the Free at GMC Facebook page for an example: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-At-GMC/304499169664558.","The course catalog is now provided online by default, with the exception of 100 copies printed for faculty. The new employee guide to the College is also available exclusively online. As of 2014, the bi-annual IR report is exclusively online. The green guide is also almost exclusively available online except for a handful of copies that are printed to display at orientation, so that students will be curious to check out the online version.","Since 2011, the communications office stopped printing the academic catalog with the exception of 100 copies for faculty; catalog distribution is now entirely online. In 2014, the College distributed the bi-annual institutional report (IR) electronically instead of printing it. The communications office also uses electronic ""flipbook"" software to share periodicals like the Bulletin, the AR online, and the Green
Guide without having to print as many copies; in fact, this effort has reduced printing from approximately 7,000 to 4,000 per year. In 2014, Admissions have modified their communication plan for incomplete and complete applicants to eliminate more paper- routine correspondence is communicated electronically. There are still some communications -- acceptance letters, change of status (transfer) and certificates of enrollment--that are send via paper.","Each May, the Green Move Out program at GMC diverts reusable items from the landfill that students dispose of when moving out of the residence halls. A team of over ten volunteers and sustainability office staff works during the last week of finals through the day after commencement on this project. Signs and emails advertise the event in the residence halls the week before students begin to vacate the
campus for the summer break. Students are encouraged to bring unbroken, working and pre-owned items to designated areas in the first-floor lounges of their residence halls.

Many students also leave a number of items in the hubs of each floor (where recycling bins and compost bins are located). The Green Move Out Team moves usable items that could be donated/saved down to the lounges the week of move-out. “Lounge Shopping” is advertised among the campus community during the week prior to graduation. Most undergraduates move out during this week. A number of faculty, staff and other students take advantage of this opportunity to take unwanted items. Thousands of pounds of clothing, furnishing, bedding, appliances, etc. are taken to new homes. 

Before Commencement, the Green Move Out Team bags up unwanted clothes and bedding and donates them to local charities such as the Poultney thrift store, the Rutland Women’s Shelter, the Salvation Army and the Rutland Area Humane Society (all items go through quality control to ensure cleanliness and usability). Non-perishable food items are donated to the Poultney Food Shelf.

Other reusable items are placed in storage closets, the Free Store, and the Freepo to be given away to new students in the fall. Volunteers are allowed to move back into the residence halls a few days early to help facilitate this Green Move-In Sale during Orientation. E-waste is also collected, stored in a special e-waste storage area, and then later recycled.

This project is sponsored by the sustainability office in collaboration with the office of residence life. Generally, over 5,000 lbs of material is diverted from the waste stream each year through this program (not including zero-sort recycling and e-waste). In 2015, 5,720 lbs of reusable material was diverted, and in 2014 it was 5,982 lbs.",,The waste diversion crew that works for the sustainability office collects data daily on the weight of post-consumer food waste and notes particularly wasteful trends.,"As a matter of practice the cooks try to minimize waste by buying appropriate amounts, making stock out of vegetable scraps, and donating perishable food to donation centers at the end of the semesters and before breaks. The sustainability office weighs daily amounts of pre-consumer food waste.

In FY2016, students, staff and community members have begun working together to divert through low-cost community meals usable food that in the past would have been composted.  Working in conjunction with the Food Recovery Network, Green Mountain College’s Food Partners Network and the Creative Composters of Green Mountain College hosted their first community meal in February 2016, diverting 72 lbs of food that would have been composted to the community meal. ","The waste diversion crew that works for the sustainability office collects data daily on the weight of post-consumer food waste and notes particularly wasteful trends. 

In FY2016, waste crew workers and other students led an incentive program to reduce post consumer food waste by 25%. Students who pledged to reduce their food waste were entered into a drawing to dump compost on student volunteers if the 25% reduction was reached. After the 25% reduction was met, the compost dump was incorporated into a larger video about Green Mountain College’s post- consumer food waste. The video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDKQqvOYHCU 
","Dining services used compostable Greenware to-go containers in 2013. The containers were manufactured by both Fabri-Kal & Pactiv and could be composted in the composting system on campus. In 2014, a student projected helped launch a reusable to-go container program. Now students, staff, and faculty pay an up front cost of $6.50 in return for unlimited use of a reusable to-go container, which
can be returned and washed by the dining hall. Participants have a plastic card that shows they are in the program. Since Fall of 2015, all incoming new students were given a free to-go container during their orientation for them to participate in the program while at GMC.  ","China serviceware is utilized for dine in use in the dining hall. Take-out containers are available as well for us in the dining hall and are made of reusable plastic as described above. Additionally, reusable plastic baskets are used in the retail location (""The Buttery"").

Trayless Dining: students only take what they can carry and no longer fill their trays with items that will ultimately be wasted. Dining services also saves on water, labor and power by not having to clean the extensive amount of trays that would be needed for service if they were to be included in the program.

Project Green Thumb-encourages recycling and composting in kitchen and prep areas. Bins are provided in the kitchen for the recycling of all packaging as well as for compost.
",http://www.greenmtn.edu/sustainability/sustainability-on-campus/waste-diversion/,"Performance year is FY 2015. The numbers of waste generation include the Poultney and Killington campuses. Compost numbers include compostable food scraps that are composted on the campus farm and uncontaminated ash from the biomass plant that has a similar fate in that it becomes part of the working landscape (The ash is donated to a local farmer who spreads it on his fields to ""sweeten"" the soil or raise the pH). We include it under waste diversion because we also count the portion of it that is landfilled when it is removed from the smoke stack and contaminated with oil residue. Reuse numbers include material diverted to our two free reuse stores on campus and material donated to charities during Green Move Out. Recycling numbers include zero-sort recycling, cardboard recycling, e-waste recycling, metal recycling, and refrigerator recycling.

","Harvard manages a Recycling and Surplus Center, free to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis that includes surplus furniture, supplies and equipment donated by school departments and offices.

Harvard also organizes Freecycles throughout the year across campus to encourage exchange of unwanted office supplies and surplus materials. In addition, we maintain an online Reuse List where the community can post unwanted items for reuse.

Additionally, in 2013 Harvard launched a Labs Reuse List online for the laboratory community to encourage the trade, reuse, and sharing of working laboratory equipment and supplies for Cambridge, Longwood, and affiliated locations.  

In addition, surplus materials are often donated to community and non-profit organizations. In Fiscal Year 2011 alone the surplus program donated over 2.5 million dollars worth of products to over 200 charities.

Gearan of HWS signed the ACUPCC in September of 2007. However, fiscal year 2008 is the earliest year we have accurate data for waste management.  ","The Office of Sustainability often partners with the course, ENV 204, “Geography of Garbage,” to hold waste audits in front of our main student center, the Scandling Campus Center. The Colleges held two waste audits in spring 2015, one in March and one during Earth Week in April. Waste audits are used to raise awareness of “disposal” habits and also as a means of data collection to better understand residential recycling and trash. This information is used to improve sustainable materials management education, programming and infrastructure.",,"The Colleges have long-term storage for potentially reusable office furniture and materials. For all faculty and staff material requests (e.g. chairs, cabinets, furniture), HWS Facilities first checks our surplus storage area. When office furniture and materials have met their useful life here at HWS, our Facilities department then explores other reuse outlets, such as other regional colleges/universities, hospitals, etc. The used office supplies or materials are sent to the landfill only if they are deemed beyond reusable. The Facilities team exasperates all reuse options before sending anything to the landfill.

Additionally, faculty and staff use the HWS Community Board to advertise: items for sale or items an employee wishes to give away; items an employee wishes to buy, rent or borrow; services or products an employee is able to provide; upcoming events (e.g. fundraisers, garage sales) or; other information an employee believes would be helpful to co-workers. Many employees use the community listserv for the same means.",All major print items are available online and are only printed upon request. Departments/students are charged for printed items.,Students are given a limited number of print credits and are charged $.05 per page to print. Double sided printing is the equivalent to printing one page (incentivizes paper conservation).,"Every spring semester there is a large campus community effort to repurpose items through the “Community Barn Sale,” a garage sale-type event. The sale provides a means to repurpose items and directs them away from the landfill. It’s also used as a fundraiser for a local nonprofit. This fundraising aspect helps to incentivize students to take the extra step to donate. This past spring was the 10th anniversary for this very popular and successful event. During the last couple of weeks of the spring semester bins and donation areas are placed/created in residential halls throughout campus. In addition, Facilities assists in moving large items such as couches, TVs, etc. from the residential halls to the Barn Sale location. The Colleges’ Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning hires students to collect, organize and price materials for resale. Students know that they can donate items at the end of the semester to the Barn Sale. The Barn Sale collection also includes unwanted electronics, which are either resold or responsibly discarded using a third party e-waste service. In spring 2015, the Barn Sale raised more than $10,000 for Geneva 2020, an HWS partnership with Geneva City School District using a collective impact model to improve student success in the local school district. The Office of Sustainability works with Residential Education to coordinate distribution of blue recycling bags and clear trash bags to all residents during end of semester floor meetings. In addition, a reusable item and e-waste collection is coordinated leading up to and during move-out. 
During first-year move-in, the Office of Sustainability and EcoReps monitor first-year residential halls. They assist students with any sustainability questions, but specifically focus on educating new students about the proper waste streams at HWS.","Grounds to Grow On program: During summer 2014, more than 15 HWS offices and departments participated in the Grounds to Grow On program through Keurig. The Grounds to Grow On program recovers used K-cup packs to prevent them from entering landfills. Used K-cups are placed in a bin, the bin is shipped to Keurig, then Keurig separates the components, composting the grounds and incinerating the plastic pack to generate electricity. In addition to preventing K-cups from entering our nearby landfill, the Grounds to Grow On program was used at HWS to better inform offices and departments of the responsibility they have for the waste they create. 
Reusable Water Bottles: Since fall 2009, all incoming first-year students are given a free reusable water bottle. The water bottle is an indication to first years of the Colleges’ commitment to sustainability, but also a practical gift for students to use while on campus. The reusable water bottles significantly decrease the purchase and disposal of single use water and beverage containers.
Drink Local Campaign: Through the Carver and DeLaney Family Environmental Studies Endowment, two HWS students started the Drink Local campaign on campus during the fall of 2013. The campaign resulted in the installation of nearly 10 new water bottle refill stations across campus, the distribution of more than 150 Nalgene water bottles, a campus map identifying all refill stations, and a Facebook page to increase awareness. The campaign is another effort at HWS to decrease the purchase and disposal of single use water and beverage containers. ","During Earth Week and Food Week students separate their silverware, plates, and organic waste in the main dining hall. The dining staff and EcoReps weigh the food waste for the day and week. Dining Services and the Office of Sustainability publicly report the pounds of food waste disposed of in our main dining hall to demonstrate how much food students are throwing away. All of this organic waste is composted.","In January 2014, our main dining facility implemented “Lean Path,” a waste tracking program that monitors pre-consumer waste. The Lean Path program continues to be an ongoing program at the Colleges.

Currently Lincoln Quads Dining Hall implements Trayless Tuesdays every week for breakfast and lunch hours.,"Lincoln Quads Dining Halls has a reusable to-go meals program. Diners can buy into the program for a one time fee that lasts the entirety of a semester. They are given a reusable container for their carry out meal. The diner may then rinse out the container and bring it back to the dining hall in exchange for a sanitized container when they are ready for their next to-go meal for the regular cost of eating in the hall. These containers are microwavable, washable, and recyclable and help reduce waste in the dining hall. ",Post-consumer waste is removed from reusable service ware and composted. Service ware is cleaned and sanitized through the Ecolab Apex dishwashing system for future use.,Reusable cups are considered refills and are charged as such at $1.00 per refill.  This is a savings of $0.50 for small beverages and more for larger beverages. ,"Dining Services uses Ecolab’s Apex™ dishwashing system.

During the 2014-2015 academic year, further waste audits were conducted by part-time student employees, with the help of volunteers, in Ballantine Hall, the School of Public Health, the School of Education, and the Psychology building. The audits were conducted before and after the ""No Bin Left Behind"" (recycling and trash bin co-location) program had been implemented in buildings. The analysis showed that the No Bin Left Behind program was effective in decreasing the contamination rate in waste and recycling streams. The audits also identified the coffee cups as a main contaminant in the recycling stream; meanwhile, plastic bottles and coffee lids and sleeves were the main items trashed which could have been recycled.",,"The policy of Indiana University is to make maximum use of furniture, equipment, and other such property. The Purchasing Department will attempt to redistribute items within the university based on equitable criteria. Any items no longer required by a department or division will be transferred to Surplus Stores for resale.

The major objectives of Surplus Stores are to: redistribute assets within the university, relieve the university of unusable assets, and to reduce landfill refuse. Given these policies and guidelines, Surplus Stores is empowered to offer items for sale to the general public once it is determined that no need for that item exists within the university. Some items that are sent to Surplus Stores are clearly ones that may be needed within the university. Therefore, an area is set aside and designated for university department purchases only. However, the vast majority of items located at Surplus Stores are available for purchase by the general public.

In 2015, the Surplus Store launched their ""smalls"" campaign and now accepts file folders, binders, markers, and other office supplies for resale as well, in addition to furniture and electronic equipment.","One.IU is Indiana University's web-based application portal that provides a common front door to online services at all IU campuses.

","The University Information Technology Services (UITS) printing allotment allows users to print in Student Technology Centers and Residential Technology Centers if you have a UITS printing account. Allotments vary according to university status:
-Undergraduate students: 650 pages per semester 
-Graduate and professional students: 1,000 pages per semester 
-Student organizations: 400 pages per semester 
-Faculty: 200 pages per semester

Students and faculty automatically receive these allotments each semester. These allotments are designed so 85% of students will not incur any additional printing expenses. Student organizations must have a faculty or staff sponsor to be eligible for a printing allotment. 

If undergraduate, graduate or professional students exceed their print allotment, they will be charged four cents ($0.04) per page. At the end of each semester, student printing totals are tabulated and over quota printing fees are added to the students' bursar bill. 

Print Less Go Green Campaign
Printing is and will always be a part of the university experience. The Print Less Go Green campaign was established to provide information to students regarding ways to reduce printing, while maintaining full access to printing services. 

From the Print Less Go Green Campaign website:
""The Student Technology Centers (STC's) are committed to finding more sustainable ways to provide you with printing on campus. The following are a few of the ways we are doing this:

*Improved Wireless Access: UITS continues to improve the speed and availability of its wireless network. Rather than carrying paper documents with you, bring your laptop to campus and have electronic access to all of your course materials.

*Improved Printer Accessibility: UITS has introduced printers in more convenient locations, so there is no need to print materials you might need later; there is always a printer nearby so you can print just the pages that you need to print. This also lessens the need for individuals in residence halls to own personal printers, which use large amounts of energy even in their idle state.

*Adobe agreement: In 2008, UITS entered into an agreement with Adobe Systems to make available to all students, faculty, and staff, the most popular Adobe software. Adobe Acrobat permits users to mark-up course materials which are downloaded from on-line resources and stored on the user computer or thumb drive. By using Adobe Acrobat, users can avoid printing these material altogether. For more information about the Adobe agreement with IU, please see http://kb.iu.edu/data/axuq.html.

*Print Release Stations: In many locations (and more to come) UITS has introduced print release stations as a way to increase student productivity. Print release stations permit the user to avoid printing output: 
-sent to the printer by mistake
-reprinted by mistake
-which is longer than expected
-when the printer is malfunctioning
-when the line at the printer is too long to wait

The number of forgotten or duplicate jobs has decreased so much that recycled paper bins which used to require emptying on a daily basis now only must be emptied weekly. We estimate a 10-25% reduction in paper waste as a result of print release stations! 
See http://kb.iu.edu/data/atsj.html for more information about print release stations and how to use them.

*Duplex Capability: Duplex printing (two-sided output) reduces paper usage as well as solid waste. Duplex printing is available in all UITS Student Technology Centers (STCs) at IUB and IUPUI, and in all Residential Technology Centers (RTCs) at IUB. See http://kb.iu.edu/data/akez.html to learn more.

*Remanufactured Toners: Printing uses more than just paper. The number of toners required to produce the crisp, clean printouts we have at IU is also reduced when we cut back on our printing. The STCs have been using remanufactured toners for many years. Benefits of using remanufactured toners over new toners include:
-38,000 tons of waste are kept out of municipal landfills per year on average
-New toners require 3 quarts of oil for their production. Remanufactured toners do not require oil for their production.
-Our toner remanufacture even reuses the boxes, reducing cardboard waste
-Purchasing remanufactured toners typically costs 30% to 50% less than new toners. Over the life of the average printer in the STCs this amounts to over $3500 in savings per machine.

*Recycled content paper: UITS is currently piloting a project to better understand the impacts of using recycled-content paper in the STCs. By exploring maintenance and cost differences we can better understand if this is feasible on a larger scale in the STCs. In the spring of 2010 the STC located in the Union will serve as a test to evaluate this. We are always looking for ways to ensure reliable and affordable printing services while improving our environmental impact.

*Duplex Printing Testing: UITS will pilot a project to better understand the impacts of setting our printers to duplex (print two sided) by default. This change has the potential to save millions of sheets of paper every year. However, we will explore how such changes affect student habits and our own maintenance patterns to ensure that we continue to meet student needs well.

STC's offer 14 tips to help reduce printing:
Tip # 1: Reading eReserves online: Reading eReserves online: Unless directed otherwise by your instructor, consider reading eReserves online. For portability, you can also download them to your laptop. Some materials are even suitable for reading on your PDA. Sometimes professors prefer that you bring printed eReserves to class for collaborative study. If you are not sure, ask your professor.

Tip # 2: Use electronic storage: If you need to take it with you, save your document or file to My Workspace in Oncourse CL, store it on a USB flash drive, or burn it to a CD or DVD. You can also email documents to yourself as attachments and save them to your personal computer when you get home. For more about file storage options, see http://kb.iu.edu/data/ajay.html.

Tip # 3: Consider printing double sided or two-up: To conserve paper, toner, and other printing resources (while stretching your IUB printing allotment or IUPUI Jagtag dollars), consider printing double-sided or 2-up (two pages per sheet). For instructions, see: http://kb.iu.edu/data/aprm.html

Tip # 4: Submit assignments electronically: Ask your instructors to accept your assignments electronically (e.g., via Oncourse CL, FTP, or email). Many instructors will.

Tip # 5: View document properties: Before printing a document, use print preview to verify that the page count and formatting is correct. This prevents printing blank or unwanted pages.

Tip # 6: Copy documents to your PDA: If you need to have your documents and eReserves available to you when you can not access the Internet, copy these documents to your PDA or laptop.

Tip # 7: Avoid printing email and web pages: Read email and web pages online. If you need to keep a copy, save it to some form of removable storage media. If you absolutely must print documents stored on the web, download them to your desktop before printing them. This will reduce printing bottlenecks and errors caused by network delays.

Tip # 8: Print just once: Be patient when sending print jobs to STC printers. Do not resend the same job multiple times if your output is delayed. Report the problem to the STC consultant. At IUB, if a consultant is not on site, call 812-855-3802 for assistance.

Tip # 9: Decrease font size: If you keep a printout for your own use, decreasing the font to the smallest legible size will reduce the number of pages printed.

Tip # 10: Use duplex printing: Duplex printing (two-sided output) is effective for lengthy material. (This will not save pages of your IUB printing allotment or reduce your cost of printing at IUPUI, but it will reduce waste paper.) For more, see http://kb.iu.edu/data/akez.html.

Tip # 11: Use print preview: Most applications in the STCs have a print preview feature that allows you to see how your printed document will appear so you can catch formatting errors or blank pages before you print. It is also particularly useful when you are printing web pages, which are often much longer than they appear to be.

Tip # 12: Run spell check: Use your application#chr(39)#s spell checker to reduce mistakes and avoid reprints.

Tip # 13: Print only final copies: Instead of printing draft copies of your work, edit your work online and print only the final copy.

Tip # 14: Use smaller margins: Instead of use 1.25” margins, set your documents to use 1” margins to save paper and your allotment.""

Hoosier to Hoosier is a partnership between the City of Bloomington, Indiana University, Cutters Soccer Club (2015), and Monroe County Habitat for Humanity (2010-2014). Funds raised through the Hoosier to Hoosier sale go to a number of local organizations. Our volunteer compensation program allows local organizations to apply to receive a portion of proceeds based on the number of volunteer hours their organization provides to sale efforts. 

H2H aims to intercept reusable items that would otherwise end up in the landfill from IU dormitories, Greek houses, and off-campus student housing. Items are collected starting in late April/early May through early August. Under an agreement with the Warehouse, a local community recreation center, collected items are stored through the summer, until sale day in late August. The sale date is designed to coincide with student move-in, in an attempt to reduce the number of new items purchased by students at the start of the academic year.

At 2015 sale, H2H took in $40,700 and sent the remaining 3 semi trailers worth of donations on to Goodwill to be processed and sold. Over the summer, H2H logged 646 volunteer shifts for 1,815 hours. On sale day, 3,070 shoppers came through the doors, including 700 before 9:30am.

The  H2H steering committee estimates that 45 tons of reusable items were intercepted from the landfill, bringing the H2H total to an estimated 217 tons since the beginning of this effort in 2010.",,"In the 2011-2012 academic year, a food waste audit was done in Hoosier Cafe. All waste receptacles in the facility were blocked or removed, forcing customers to dispose of waste at a centrally located sorting station, staffed by volunteers. Volunteers asked customers to sort waste into six categories: Landfill material, plastic/glass/metals, mixed paper, corrugated cardboard, food waste and other compostable material. Volunteers educated customers about recycling while they were sorting. Waste from approximately 70 customers was collected over two hours.","Pre-consumer food waste from most dining facilities goes to the Hilltop Garden and Nature Center (on campus), where it is composted and used in the garden.","Most but not all of the dining halls use a trayless dining program. This ensures students take only what they can carry, resulting in less excess food and less food waste.",,"Some facilities serve primarily on reusable service-ware (metal silverware, ceramic dishes), including Collins Living-Learning Center, and the Woodlands in Forrest Quadrangle.","Reusable containers can be filled with soda or tea for just 59 cents at any Residential Programs and Services dining location.

In the summer of 2011, the dining hall was remodeled and all chairs and tables were donated to nonprofit companies such as the Dream Center and Midnight Mission. When there is a surplus of materials, the Center for Service in Action department is contacted so they can reach out to local nonprofit organizations and see if they are in need of any materials or equipment. When certain equipment is replaced, it is sent to the contractor for resale, rather than thrown out for scrap. ","LMU does make course catalogs, course schedules, and directories readily available online as a primary source for students to look for class-related information. Students are assigned an account on a university shared website called PROWL where students register for classes and find all the information about each individual class which include but not limited to: course schedules, directories for each department and major, advisor information, transcripts, academic records, course descriptions, syllabuses, professors’ contact information, and up-to-date changes to the class criteria. There is also another university share website called MYLMU Connect where students can receive the most up-to-date changes in syllabus, criteria, schedules, or class assignments which is specific to each class that are registered for. 
","LMU does limit free printing for students in all computer labs and the library. Free printing is limited for students through a donated monetary stipend of $25 for each school year. The allocated money can be used exclusively for black and white printing in the library and computer labs and costs 10 cents per page, allowing each student only 250 available pages to print. Color printing is not included in the donated money portion. On average, the library produces approximately 500,000 pages per semester. Loyola Marymount University’s student population approaches 6,000, each with 250 available pages to print for free. This means only 66% of the free printing is used each year. Before 1999, all printing from the library was free. LMU began charging students who printed more than 250 pages, which significantly contributed to the reduction of printing and paper waste on campus. In the case that a student surpasses 250 pages, they must use their own money to print on all printers located in the library and/or computer labs. By limiting “free” printing to only 250 pages students are discouraged to use printers located in the library and computer labs because they are charged for any printing beyond this capacity.","The LMU Recycling Team manages a comprehensive strategy for student move-out that includes recycling a large amount of cardboard, paper, and other items.

MIT works to minimize the generation and toxicity of its waste and to increase the diversion of material from the waste stream through reuse, recycling, and composting. MIT also encourages the purchase of environmentally preferable and sustainably produced products and services throughout its supply chains. The Institute will continue to innovate in this area, as it moves toward an intentional and ecologically balanced approach to material management in which the Institute clearly understands and responds to the flow of materials that enter and leave campus.

Waste Management
MIT seeks to recognize the ecological and health impacts of its waste management decisions and aims to take into account the connection between materials that enter the campus and those that leave campus.

Through recycling, composting and conservation efforts, MIT has worked hard to reduce its overall waste disposal, which has saved money while reducing the Institute’s environmental footprint.  In 2012, MIT attained a 46 percent recycling rate. Read more about these efforts at the Department of Facilities website here.

The Environment, Health and Safety Office at MIT provides guidance and support to the MIT community on the proper management of the Institute’s regulated waste. For more information on proper waste management, visit the EHS website here.

Reuse
Reuse is an important keystone of MIT’s waste reduction efforts.  The Institute has a number of programs in place for the community to find a second home for unneeded or unwanted items.

MIT ReUse is a service that allows MIT students, staff, faculty, and alumni to sell or exchange items.  This listserv community promotes waste minimization through the reuse of usable goods.   The Green Committee -- a committee of MIT's Working Group on Support Staff Issues -- operates an extensive list of MIT reuse programs and tips on ways to reduce waste. 

Choose to Reuse is held in the Stata Center (Building 32) every third Thursday of the month. MIT community members can donate and pick up free clean, reusable items for free. The event is organized by the staff Green Committee. Visit their website for more information.
Swapfest, held the third Sunday of every month, April through October, is a way to buy, sell, and swap electronic items. ","MIT Equipment Exchange collects surplus lab, computer, and office furniture for reuse within the Institute; any items that are not claimed for on campus reuse are sold to the general public for reasonable prices (http://web.mit.edu/workinggreen/reuse/reuse.html).

In addition, the Property Department of MIT's Office of the Vice President for Finance transfers equipment and furniture from departments, labs, and centers that no longer need them to those that do (http://vpf.mit.edu/site/vpf_statement/2009/good_stuff_cheap_property_saves_dlcs_money_supports_green_initiative).
",Most class material is available first on-line via websites and course-ware. ,Students are provided a limited paper budget and MIT tracks central print jobs and charges above the budget.,"Each spring at the end of May, MIT hosts Stuff Fest, where students would are leaving the dorms for the summer can donate excess clothing and housewares. The event can generate more that 7,000 pounds of clothing, housewares, and food. Items can be claimed by other students for reuse. The Women's League also collects clothing for their Interview Clothing for Women and Men program and housewares for the MIT Student Furniture Exchange. Remaining items are sent to Planet Aid.

The Clean Plates at State food waste program at MSU helps put environmental sustainability into perspective for campus dining hall guests. The program seeks to reduce the amount of food waste on campus through education initiatives and a recurring food waste audit.
In fall 2005, a preliminary food waste audit was conducted in two of the 15 dining halls — one day each at Akers and Brody Dining Halls. Between the two venues, a total of 1,411 lbs. of food was wasted, an average of 4.48 ounces per person.

Since that time, an annual food waste audit has been conducted in the various dining halls on campus, measuring food waste and customer behavior. The food waste audit utilizes electronic scales that weigh each customer's plate subtracting a tare allowance for each type of plate across campus.

Among other items, when possible, practical and feasible, the University will strive to select products that are: Durable as opposed to single use or disposable, Non or minimally toxic, preferably biodegradable, Contain a high recycled content, especially post consumer recycled content, highly recyclable at the end of the life-cycle, and shipped responsibly by combining shipments with other shipments to the University or region with
minimal packaging consistent with care of product made from recycled and/or recyclable materials.

We are not allowed to give surplus property away. The Property Surplus Department is the only NAU department authorized to dispose of surplus property. The primary role of the Property Surplus department is to ensure that the excess property generated by NAU will be handled in a method that both maximizes the return to the University and meets the disposal requirements of the state and federal governments.

Free printing is limited to some Graduate Assistant Offices only. Facility Services has implemented three major changes to printing on most centralized printers; default duplex printing, default black and white instead of color printing, and enabled a secondary setting that reduced toner consumption by lowering the print density.

Facility Services was also awarded a Green Fund grant to purchase 12 tablets for building inspectors to reduce the need for printed plans. That translates to almost 600 plans a month that no longer need to be printed due to digital access with the tablets.","The ""Leave Green"" campaign was the marketing effort to enhance the existing residence hall move out waste diversion program benefiting local, not-for-profit agencies.

Batteries can also be recycled at Facility Services as well as light bulbs. There is also a central drop-off location location for glass in parking lot P62B.

Housing and Residence Life participates in several Terracycle brigades in an effort to divert additional items from the waste stream. These include used personal care containers, used writing utensils, and snack bags and liners. Since starting in 2015, we have diverted over 8,000 items from the waste stream.

Residents in the Residence Halls can drop off used batteries and ink cartridges at the front desk of their residence hall. They are then taken to Facility Services, which coordinates the recycling of them.","NAU annually audits the waste stream of the University including our dining areas. NAU Campus Dining tracks and reports their waste stream of landfill, recyclables and compost to the EPA Food Recovery Challenge annually using LeanPath software, City of Flagstaff tipping weights of recycling and refuse and the NAU Composting Programs daily weight logs for tracking and measurement. Dining Services also coordinates “Weigh the Waste” events within the resident dining halls throughout the academic year to educate students on daily food waste and its impact on the environment and provide analysis of post-consumer waste.
","For four years and counting NAU Dining has diverted pre-consumer food waste through the on campus compost program, diligently tracking all back of house food waste through the support of LeanPath System; a food waste tracking system and being part of the EPA Food Recovery Challenge. 200,000 pounds of pre-consumer compost is amended into soil each year on the NAU campus which is donated to on-campus and community gardens. Through the use of these tools and efforts, NAU Campus Dining has seen significant reduction in pre-consumer food waste and diversion of these materials out of the landfill. ","Resident dining halls removed the option for customers to use trays in an effort to encourage more mindful eating behaviors, taking one plate at a time and in turn reducing post-consumer food waste in the early 2000’s. Trayless dining also reduces water waste, energy waste, and food waste in our residential dining locations. Every time a meal is served without a tray, a quarter of water, one ounce of food waste, plus the detergent and energy needed for washing trays is saved. NAU Campus Dining Services also coordinates events like “Weigh the Waste” within the resident dining throughout the academic year with First Year Seminar course students to bring awareness to waste reduction specifically post-consumer waste. Students sort and weigh the waste and analyze the post-consumer waste stream for improvements on waste minimization as well as become more empowered as individuals to reduce their waste footprint overall. This fall NAU Athletics with the help of NAU Dining and the Office of Sustainability took part in the EPA Game Day Challenge which encourages football fans to reduce their game day waste. NAU focused on tailgate area recycling and concession waste reduction with compostable items which creates a 34% diversion rate of waste from the Oct. 31, 2015 game against Northern Colorado University. ","All retail cold beverage cups in the 16 oz. size (which is the size that comes with the meal plan transfers, that are the high volume purchased) are made of compostable materials from Pepsi Co.

At the Green Scene Café reusable to-go sandwich and salad containers are available for purchase which also come with the incentive of the $0.50 discount each time the container is used.,"NAU Campus Dining strives to reduce their impact on the environment and reduce consumption of natural resources by employing best practices in the areas of waste minimization (i.e. LeanPath System, NAU Compost Program), energy reduction, and water conservation. Education and outreach to the campus community are also facilitated through a variety of Campus Dining marketing vehicles such as table tents, LCD screen imaging and special events to encourage reducing waste on campus, relating to food waste, recycling, and how to get involved with such projects on campus. 

Other initiatives Campus Dining has implemented to reduce waste that have not already been listed include the “Take A Taste” program encouraging tasting of foods before taking an entire plate, using products (napkins and some containers) made of recycled materials, removing plastic bags and Styrofoam from Dining’s retail services, water refill stations, and the Food Recovery Network. 

Take a Taste is a program within resident dining; staff at each platform keeps a small number of portions size samples of the main entrée available for a taste test. Along with the signage “Take A Taste” its main objective is to encourage customers to try a small sample of the dish before taking a full serving to ensure the least amount of food is wasted. By using recycled materials and non petroleum based products, we are decreasing the amount of virgin materials being harvested and fossil fuels in the production of for disposable ware. A large component of the retail dining is “to-go”. This requires a number of disposable materials. Dining Services works with their vendors to encourage the use of sustainable products and ensure proper recycling of containers when possible. Campus Dining went Styrofoam free across its retail dining locations in the fall of 2012. Dining went bagless in the fall of 2010, which has annually removed 33,000 plastic bags from the campus supply chain and saved over a ton of carbon in production and disposal of the bags. All of the brown napkins are made of 100% recycled materials. Each case of napkins used in our express dispenser saves 126 gallons of water, one cubic feet of landfill space, and seven gallons of water (compared to virgin fiber products). Express napkin dispensers make it easy for you to get the napkins you need while reducing the number used and wasted, saving valuable natural resources.

Filtered water refill stations are available in both the University Union and the du Bois Center. Several other hydration/water bottle fill stations have been installed in various buildings on campus. These stations encourage the use of reusable containers instead of buying individually bottled water.

Student’s established the NAU Food Recovery Network which is a national program that empowers students to reduce food waste in their community either on campus with their Dining halls, local grocery stores and restaurants. NAU Food Recovery Network began daily pick ups of hot, cooled, and frozen food from campus in October 2014.

Oberlin College has had an informal printing toner and ink cartridge recycling program in place for a few years. In 2013-2014, the Sustainable Purchasing Intern conducted research on different programs, talked with staff, and initiated a new cartridge recycling program to be rolled out across campus.",The CDS Recyclers and the Resource Conservation Team have performed informal audits at various events and dining halls on campus.,CDS employees keep tabs on which foods sell and adjust their production accordingly.,"In Stevenson in 2012-2014 CDS employees were asked to keep specific track of food leftovers and food temperatures. This way the College would know what foods are not being eaten and we'd be able to begin participating in food rescue (health code requires that food temperatures must be meticulously tracked in order to be deemed safe to be eaten).

Additionally, CDS practices allow for food to be served and leftovers to be cooled appropriately and re-heated for the next day. This reduces food waste since dishes that don't run out when they are first served are not thrown away, but rather reserved.

The trays at Stevenson and Lord Saunders Dining at Afrikan Heritage House have been removed to encourage mindful eating habits and to engage in more sustainable practices.","We provide reusable containers to students who wish to carry out food at our largest to go facility. A three dollar deposit is required to join the program, although this is returned if students decide to return the container at the end of the semester.

Surplus department captures reusable items for repurposing on campus or resale.  Construction and design carefully considers reuse and salvage in every project.,All food waste from the dining halls is captured in the kitchens by scraping plates into dedicated compost collection bins prior to washing of dishes.  The percentage of food waste captured fluctuates between 95-98% with very little contamination.  Composting of food waste is done on-campus through a combination of in-vessel digesters and windrows.  All compost is weighed before processing.,"Culinary Services relies heavily upon inventory data from past years; such benchmarking of past inventory needs has proved to be a fantastic asset when forecasting for the future. Our forecasting data also takes holidays, seasons and more into account in order to gain a clearer picture of future inventory needs.

Recent renovations have focused on reducing food waste from the production end as well. For example, the cook/chill system and central production kitchen at our Central Food Facility has helped us to further reduce waste by centralizing production. Instead of making soup, sauces, pasta, rice and other food items individually in all of our units, these items are made in one location and shipped out. The cook/chill system allows us to produce food in bulk and then chill it for up to 30 days.

This central production model also allows us to eliminate redundant machinery within each of our Dining Courts/Halls and affords us with a smaller, more energy efficient production footprint. There is also minimal food waste within the Central Food Facility as a result of this central production model.","All of Culinary Services' Dining Courts/Halls track food waste, excluding the food that is served to student diners and then thrown away by the student diner. The national benchmark for food waste in a food operation is 2% of the total value of food purchased.  

In the 2013-14 school year, our dining courts/halls purchased $4,800,482 in food. The dollar value of the food thrown away was $56,898, or 1.19% of the total value of food purchased. Compared to 2010-11, when Culinary Services did not have a centralized production kitchen and cook-chill facility, the value of food thrown away was $82,340 (this number has been adjusted for inflation).  

Culinary Services has reduced the value of food waste by $25,442 which is a 31% reduction in food waste ($25,442 divided by $82,340 = 31%). Such numbers highlight the fact that Ohio University Culinary Services produces only a small amount of waste (and well below the national average).

Post consumer food waste is tracked through our composting system as described above in the food waste audit section (all compost is weighed before processing).  Programs to reduce post-consumer waste are described in the dining services waste minimization section below (signage, educational programs, self-serve options).

Additionally, all of our staff is ServSafe certified in safe food handling and have the necessary qualifications to determine if food is safe to reuse. It is not a safe practice to re-heat food more than once, and any leftover food that has already been re-heated is thrown away. Leftover food that has been re-heated once cannot be donated due to the risk of foodborne illness. ","Culinary Services explored the possibilty of reusable containers; however, these are against the Ohio Food Code and would not pass a local health inspection. All of our campus dining venues utilize compostable take-out containers that help to both maximize the use of our two campus composting vessels and further ongoing campus sustainability efforts.  All of our compostable service ware is BPI certified.","All dining halls use reusable service ware (plates, glasses, bowls, knives, forks, etc.) for all dine-in operations. To-go options and operations at our Student Union use compostable options on all items packaged in house (plates, clamshells, knives, forks, dressing ramekins, napkins, hot and cold cups including lids, etc.).  We have a comprehensive on-campus composting facility.","Culinary Services offers discounts to customers utilizing reusable mugs at all five campus cafés and our primary food court located in the campus student center. The regular cost of a 16 oz coffee at a campus café is $1.75. Use of a reusable mug discounts this price to $1.25, for a recurring savings of .50 cents per visit.","Ohio University Culinary Services is committed to providing the highest quality dining and consumer experience possible for the diverse university community and guests; such commitment supports the educational mission and residential concept of Ohio University.

We collaborate with the Office of Sustainability to help educate students regarding food waste and how they can help to decrease the amounts of wasted food. Signs are posted in all Dining Courts/Halls encouraging students to take only what they know they will eat and to not be shy about asking for smaller portions. Furthermore, Shively Court and Nelson Court, two of our most recently renovated dining venues, provide numerous self-serve concepts in which customers can choose their own portions. Such self service stations have greatly reduced our amounts of food waste.",http://www.ohio.edu/sustainability,"We’re always looking for new ways to increase our sustainability and reduce food waste. We also value student input; in fact, the Culinary Services Development Committee (CSDC) is a student-led group that helps us to evaluate sustainability-related ideas and initiatives. Our recent reusable bags initiative, in which all 2013-2014 residential students on a meal plan were provided with a reusable bag free of charge, was borne out of CSDC.

eBuy, the University’s e-procurement system, reduces paper usage by electronically delivering purchasing orders and electronically processing invoices and payments. 

Travel Services uses a paperless transaction process, including accepting electronic documents as official receipts for reconciliation and reimbursement.

The following vendor requirements have been implemented to reduce waste:
- Required DELL to provide eco friendly and more efficient packaging when shipping computers.
- Required PEPSI to use less plastic in their bottled products.
- Required the elimination of Styrofoam peanuts in the packaging of products sent to PSU.

For ceiling tiles and carpet, worked with vendors to implement recycling of old product when replaced with new product. ","Penn State's Furniture Re-use Program collects and redistributes furniture among Penn State University offices.

","Princeton uses reusable boxes for supply deliveries from OfficeMax. This simple shift has prevented the disposal of over 17,000 cardboard boxes in the past four years.","The University Surplus Program has donated, reused, or sold more than 95 percent of discarded furniture and electronics in the past year. Year-end donations from Princeton students have risen significantly since 2008.","While making the above materials available online rather than in print is not official university policy (meaning it is not mandatory), it has increasingly become the practice here to publish online instead of in print. This began as a cost-cutting method, implemented aggressively in early 2009, and has become accepted practice.
 
Additionally, any unit that publishes newsletters or other informational products has been strongly encouraged to publish online only, where possible, providing print publications only upon request or in situations where the print version is necessary.
 
All course catalogs and schedules are offered online. As of 2012/2013, Princeton’s Admissions Office transitioned to only taking online applications and only notifying students about their application electronically.
 
During 2014, OIT has worked with several offices on campus to develop and implement a new paperless advising system. These ‘advising tools’ were used for the first time in September to facilitate the valuable discussions between the students of the class of 2017 and their residential college advisers. A significant undertaking, the project concluded with great success in large part due to the strong partnerships between the Office of the Dean of the College, the six Residential Colleges, the Office of International Programs, the Office of the Registrar, and several groups within OIT working collaboratively toward the same end. New electronic student folders, a restructured AB/BSE program form, and several custom advising “dashboards” within the Peoplesoft Teaching and Advising system work together to streamline and enhance first-term student advising in the residential colleges. The new electronic folders also align with University sustainability and paperless initiatives and feature enhanced security protections.","Each student is given a quota for the number of pages per semester that he/she may print. Princeton also highly encourages students to print less and view documents electronically. In addition, the University's printers automatically print double sided (unless otherwise specified by the student) to conserve paper. ","Any student may store their belongings during the summer through the Princeton Student Agencies Moving and Storage Agency for a fee. Additionally, by providing summer storage to international students and students studying abroad, the University is helping to reduce potential waste that could otherwise result from packaging and shipping.

To reduce the amount of move-out waste, the Eco-Reps work with Building Services each year to place collection bins at about 20 sites across campus. Students are encouraged to donate books, school supplies, clothing, unopened food and toiletries, furniture, and other reusable materials.","In an effort to be good stewards of University resources, quality surplus materials, including various types of equipment and furniture are reused on campus whenever possible via the Surplus Program. What’s no longer needed in one department often finds a home in another. And, if the surplus can’t be used on campus, the University makes it available for purchase by employees and the public, or coordinates the donation to a charity. The Surplus Program also handles the disposition of items that must be scrapped or discarded due to federal and state disposal regulations, as well as for health and safety reasons.",,"Campus Dining uses “Food Pro,” a food procurement and ordering program that uses historical data and yield-tested recipes to forecast quantities and servings that limits the daily amount of food wasted in dining operations. The historical data includes the time that the recipe was cooked in the last year, how much of the recipe was cooked, and how much of the recipe was taken by students or remained as leftovers that were later composted, repurposed or frozen for later use. The program uses an algorithm to analyze these numbers to create new recipes that prevents cooking too much food. ","In spring 2009, Greening Princeton advocated for Princeton Campus Dining to remove trays from their dining halls. Greening Princeton and Campus Dining conducted two pilot trayless dining nights at Forbes College, in which Campus Dining monitored changes in food waste, water, and energy usage and Greening Princeton members manned a table at the dining hall entrance to educate students on the benefits of trayless dining and took a survey to gauge student support for the initiative. Once students were informed of the impressive benefits of trayless dining, 81% said that they supported the switch. Greening Princeton conducted a campus-wide publicity campaign to inform the student body of these benefits and help Campus Dining make a smooth transition to removing trays. As of summer 2011, all campus dining halls became ""trayless.""","All campus eateries that offer to-go options provide recyclable, recycled content, or compostable containers.

","Whenever a lab gets shut down, the Environmental Health and Safety department will send out a memo to all of the other research labs who can take materials as necessary. This prevents unnecessary waste from the various labs on campus since the materials are being reused. This includes glassware and lab equipment in addition to the various chemicals and gasses that are unused.

The IT department has a similar program called rice classifieds that allows the IT department to offer electronic waste to the faculty. Once the off-site Rice IT center accumulates enough electronics, it then pallets the electronics and sells them in bulk on Rice classifieds. This gives professors and staff the opportunity to purchase these goods and use them instead of adding them to the landfill. 

The university also organizes an office supplies swap where every department can donate unused or unwanted office supplies. These include everything from staplers and file folders to office chairs and cabinets. Students, faculty, and staff can then pick through the stuff and take what they want or need, preventing the stuff from being thrown away unnecessarily. ","All course catalogs and schedules are available only online. Students must log on to the Rice course catalog and sign up for classes through the registrar's website. No paper is used when looking up classes nor when registering for them. 

Rice has also begun switching from paper timesheets to online submittal timesheets. Many departments are already taking advantage of the paperless timesheets over the tradition paper submittal. This is coupled with the preference to have employees sign up for direct deposit instead of receiving paper checks. The university has incentivized this option by allowing the employee to receive their check directly in their account without having to visit the payroll office. Next, the university also offers W-2s online instead of in paper form. The employee can then print as necessary the single sheet without having the associated mailing paper waste as well. 

The office of procurement no longer will be accepting paper order forms, all requests must go through the online ordering system. This greatly reduces waste as previous order forms were 3 pages of carbon-paper per order. Now, no paper is generated as all orders are managed online. 

All requests to housing and dining as well as environmental health and safety is through online submissions. Students, faculty and stuff do not need written requests for services nor repair anymore. Instead, the email or fill out the online form and the respective department will respond as necessary.",There is no free printing at Rice University. Every student must pay per sheet printed when using any of the on-campus printers. ,"The EcoReps have started a program called freecycle which allows students to place their unwanted goods at a central table for other students to take during move-out. Some of the residential colleges also offer summer storage. Students may keep their goods at the college over the summer.

They also collect scrap electronics and other materials that can be repurposed or taken apart for use in simple freshmen engineering designs. Unused materials that students order are also stored to allow future teams to make use of the materials in an effort to divert waste. ","Through the ENST 302/ SOCI 304 class, students have calculated the amount of pre-consumer and post-consumer food waste per capita for the institution. ","Blast chillers allow the kitchens to re-use food by preventing the food from going to waste.

During these ""Weigh the Waste"" events, all plates are scraped and the food waste is weighed and recorded at 15 minute intervals. The information is then posted so students can learn more about food waste. There is also a game that students can participate in during the event where they estimate how much post-consumer food waste is generated during the lunch period. Information and facts about food waste are also distributed to generate awareness. These audits are a chance to identify source reduction strategies, identify waste stream contamination reduction opportunities, lower costs and develop educational programming. The most recent Weigh the Waste event took place during lunch on April 16th, 2015. The final weight was 90.2lbs of food and paper napkin weight. This number translates to 0.2 pounds of waste per person who attended lunch that day, which was 450 people.

Eliminating trays is in line with Aramark’s overall Corporate Social Responsibility strategy, and it is what our customers have come to expect. The benefits of going trayless are not only environmental, but economic and humanitarian as well. Going trayless enables us to better allocate our resources while helping the environment and addressing the current food crisis. Aramark also trains employees to prepare food in ways that reduce food waste, and this practice is monitored through the Food Management Program. Preconsumer waste is collected in buckets and analyzed with staff to ensure proper trimming, thus reducing unnecessary waste.","During the Waste Audits, post-consumer food waste is tracked using a poster, which remains in the residential dining hall locations so that students will be prompted to think about waste during their meal. Weigh the Waste aims to raise awareness of post-consumer food waste for students and to track a downward trend in post-consumer food waste from event to event and semester to semester. The frequency of the waste audits are increased in the spring semester to gather more data and to reach more students. Marketing materials are being developed that translate the food waste into facts and figures that students can better understand. For example, during November Weigh the Waste, each person generated 0.2 lbs of post-consumer food waste, which equals 20 lbs of food waste per person per month. 20 lbs of food waste equates to the weight of a car tire. The amount wasted could feed 5 people for a day. All of this information will be distributed to students through marketing and social media. Hydration stations are offered in residential dining locations across the  Saint Louis University campus. In addition to the traditional filtered water station, residential dining will also offer infused water stations, with water flavored by produce such as cucumbers and oranges, etc. on a daily basis. ","In the continual effort to reduce disposable packaging at its source, Aramark commits to implementing a reusuables program whenever possible. Reusable to go containers, cups,and mugs offer customers a hands-on opportunity to lighten their personal footprint and make a positive impact on their environment. Aramark's reusable water bottles continue to be popular on campus. In an effort to reduce impact on the environment, Aramark offers reusable ecoClamshell containers to encourage patrons to forgo disposable containers. The sustainable ecoClamshell program allows students to purchase a reusable container for a one-time fee of $5 at either Griesdieck or Reinert Dining Hall.

When Sheridan launched the Zero Waste initiative in 2012, the target of waste reduction was set to measure against the baseline year (initially 2011). However, since 2010/2011 waste data are not available, this cannot be used as Sheridan's waste diversion baseline. Instead, we have recently changed the baseline year to 2013/2014 FY because these data are more reliable and complete.

We are maintaining a performance year of 2013/2014 fiscal year to be consistent with the other data reported in this STARS submission.","Spinnaker Recycling Corp. was employed by Sheridan College’s Office for Sustainability to perform a detailed waste audit of the B-Wing and Cafeteria areas of the Trafalgar Campus in April 2013, with the goal of determining the current composition of the waste materials generated within these areas.

The Green printers make it possible for students to print from any printer on campus from the global print queue. It has helped prevent students from printing jobs, forgetting them, and then reprinting which results in the unnecessary use of paper. Additionally, the Green printers are set to duplex printing by default to encourage using less paper. The printing rates are 4 cents per page and 3 cents per page for duplex jobs. The Print Green project has resulted in the reduction of paper waste, the number of pages printed, amount of toner and supplies used the amount of power consumed, and the cost of equipment leases and maintenance.","In line with Sheridan’s Zero Waste initiative, Residence has implemented garbage bins, recycling bins, and organic waste bins in every suite.

The landfilled dumpsters from different buildings are selected and a team of volunteers sorts the material into 12 categories.  Key findings include over 25% of the waste sent to landfill is recyclable and 39% of the waste sent to landfill is compostable.  The waste audits help the university determine next steps in its Zero Waste Program.,"Wherever possible, Stanford strives to minimize waste through its purchases. Minimization of packaging is a central aspect of the sustainable purchasing guidelines used on campus. For more details, please visit:
http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/buypaying/policy_notes/sustainable_purchase.html","Stanford has a Surplus Property Sales department which houses surplus university assets and resells them to university affiliates or any members of the surrounding community.  Items sold through surplus property include machinery, electronics, furniture, and office supplies.  Stanford also has a furniture reutilization program that ensures excess furniture does not end up in the landfill. A REUSE website maintained by Surplus Property Sales enables Stanford departments to transfer materials between each other.","Stanford recently switched its course bulletin to an online-only format in order to save paper and other resources.  Students can view transcripts, course schedules, course directories, grades, and many other academic resources online through Axess, Stanford’s web-based record management system. None of these materials are printed except by individual request.",All students must pay a printing fee of $0.10 per page to release a job on any Stanford-owned printer. ,"Stanford hosts multiple campus “free stores,” where students can drop off any unwanted goods and take anything they would like for free. Also, Stanford established and launched a formal “Give & Go” campaign to reduce waste in residence halls during the annual move-out period (http://www.stanford.edu/dept/rde/cgi-bin/drupal/housing/give-go). In addition, Student Housing maintains a comprehensive website resource for move-out, with details about all the materials collected and the corresponding collection points on campus.","Stanford's Deskside Recycling and Mini Trash Bin Program is the newest paper waste collection system based on the concept of minimizing waste and maximizing recycling.  It consists of two bins, one 14 quart blue recycling bin and one 1.15 gallon mini black trash bin that hangs on the side of the recycling bin.  Custodians are responsible for emptying both the recycling and trash bins on a weekly schedule. To date, over 7,500 sets of bins have been placed in 82 buildings on campus.

Additionally, Stanford has recently expanded its composting program, since waste audits have shown that organic waste comprises 31% of material sent to the landfill. For instance, Student Housing has expanded its paper towel composting program and has formal plans to make some of their residences Zero Waste. This program was rolled out in 2015 and began with several of the high-profile row houses. Also in 2015, Stanford launched an interior composting program for the first time, where Stanford's waste management contractor will set up and service compost bins inside academic buildings at a minor cost to each department. As of February 2016, 50 buildings are participating in this program, and the waste composted through this program increased from 1,140 pounds in July 2015 to 2,560 pounds in November 2015. The university also operates a voluntary composting program and continues to strategically add shared compost dumpsters across campus to make it easier for building occupants to discard organic waste from the small compost bins that they individually maintain. 

Stanford also continues its endeavors to make sure all recycling and composting bins are labeled uniformly. Stanford has re-labeled over half the bins on campus and will steadily continue to re-label the remaining bins. These labels clearly show what types of products should be put in which bins, and their consistency across campus will translate to higher levels of recognition among individuals and, in turn, improved individual recycling habits.

","As part of R&DE’s “Love Food Hate Waste” program, the university purchased at least one Lean Path system for every dining hall in order to weigh and track food waste. The system tracks and weighs all kitchen food waste and then assigns the food waste to categories and each culinary staff member. Staff monitor and assess progress and utilize the analytics of the waste data to help control and reduce food waste. The Sustainable Food Program Manager also runs spot checks on the compost bins, takes photos of food waste, and uses these images in culinary staff trainings. The food waste reduction system and use of the system is incorporated into new staff onboarding for all levels of dining hall staff. As part of Stanford's participation in Recyclemania, R&DE also partners with PSSI and recently a group of graduate students who got a Green Fund Grant from the Office of Sustainability to audit our waste and train our staff. ","As described previously, R&DE has installed one to two Lean Path weighing systems in every dining hall. Staff must weigh all excess pre-consumer food waste before they compost it. The data is used to help reduce food waste and to make staff more aware of this pressing issue. The Sustainable Food Program Manager has trained staff on the Lean Path system and given trainings to dining hall staff about the problems of food waste in the United States to create a larger contextual reference for focusing on the issue. Stanford works with its suppliers and partners to develop sourcing practices that reduce waste prior to coming to Stanford. This would include procuring meats, seafood, and produce in the most ready-to-use state for our food service operations. Staff work strategically with vendors/partners in the dining halls and utilize their expertise and training to ensure Stanford maximizes the utilization of product once it
enters the dining facilities. 

Stanford's inventory management practices use industry best standards and practices for just in time ordering, quality control steps reviewing temperature and quality of products received, and FIFO (first in, first out) inventory process. The vendor management team works closely with vendors on quality control concerns to have products coming into the kitchens that are of the highest quality to reduce food spoilage issues. There are semi-annual business reviews to review procurement standards, outcomes, and process to ensure R&DE is meeting the goals of the organization and to discuss measures to improve effectiveness of its procurement process.
Stanford tracks customers’ swipes to understand trends in dining hall attendance over time, and thus, is able to alter production to minimize overproduction. The university also closes dining halls when counts are expected to be extremely low, such as a home football game, in order to minimize food waste.
","R&DE has implemented trayless dining in each of its dining halls. This voluntary initiative is primarily designed to decrease food waste and to reduce the incentive to over-consume food. Eliminating trays has also reduced the amount of water and energy that is otherwise required to wash them. We also reduced plate and bowl sizes years ago to reduce food waste and encourage healthful eating.  

R&DE does occasional post-consumer waste weighing to track food waste from students. All post-consumer food waste is composted. R&DE holds educational campaigns, such as “Caught Green-Handed” in the dining halls and cafes to educate students, staff, and faculty about composting and Recyclemania. Numerous student classes and groups have also worked on projects to interview students and customers to devise ways to reduce post-consumer food waste. 
","R&DE Stanford Dining eliminated disposable food and beverage containers from all dining halls and replaced them with reusable serviceware. R&DE also gives all new students on the meal plan and dining hall staff a reusable mug at the beginning of the year. When needed, such as special events and Late Night dining, R&DE uses only BPI-certified compostable wares. R&DE created updated signage to make it even easier for customers to sort their waste.

R&DE Stanford Hospitality & Auxiliaries uses BPI-certified compostable products (cups, plates, bowls, and straws) in all cafes and catering projects on campus. All dining halls and cafes have full recycling and composting programs for customers.R&DE created updated signage to make it even easier for customers to sort their waste. 
",All R&DE dining halls use all reusable service ware. R&DE is trayless and has reduced the size of plates and glasses in the dining halls to encourage taking only the food that students will eat. There are no to-go meals in the dining halls.,"R&DE provides reusable mugs to all incoming freshmen and transfer students to help reduce disposable bottled beverage consumption on campus. Students can use these containers to receive discounts at select campus cafes (discount value varies by location). In addition, most campus cafes offer a discount if a patron brings a reusable mug. A student sustainability group recently inventoried and made a list of these venues available to the student body.","Because our dining halls are all-you-care-to-eat, we have employed a few methods to encourage students to take less food on their first trip through the dining hall and to take seconds if they want them. We have purchased smaller plates, bowls, and cups to minimize portion size and have gone trayless in all dining halls. For some meat entrees, our staff serves students pre-determined portions to prevent them
from piling their plates high with food they might not eat. We have Sustainable Food Program interns who work to help reduce waste and increase composting through audits and educational events. Students are stationed at compost bins during events to educate their peers about Stanford's composting programs. We host multiple zero-waste events, such as New Student Orientation (1,600 new students), which sets the sustainability tone for incoming freshmen, and Commencement.

R&DE has partnered with a student group and local non-profits to divert excess food to those who need it. We partner with the Ecumenical Hunger Program, Second Harvest Food Bank, and East Palo Alto Live in Peace to provide extra food that we cannot re-serve to those who need it. Groups pick up from our dining halls five days a week and the food goes to families and students in East Palo Alto and San Mateo County. 

The dining halls have post-consumer disposal stations where students scrape their own plates into compost containers before placing the dishware in the dishroom. The compost bins are open so students are able to see individually and collectively the amount of food that is being wasted. This practice has reduced post-consumer waste by 35%. We utilize newsletters, Facebook, and other social media to discuss and highlight food waste issues. The Sustainable Food Program Manager and the student interns write all of the material for these outlets on a bi-weekly basis discussing sustainable initiatives including food waste.

R&DE recycles all used oil into biodiesel via a non-profit in San Francisco called Greasecycle.

College Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling Policy

Introduction:

""The materials, supplies, equipment, and furniture used in a building all contribute to the quality of the environment as a whole as well as the indoor environment of the building itself. The environmental impact of these products can be reduced by purchasing materials that have been salvaged, recycled, are rapidly renewable, contain certified wood, or are manufactured locally. SUNY ESF has committed to reducing the environmental impact of materials and supplies including office paper, office equipment, furniture, furnishings, and building materials through the purchasing criteria stated in this policy.""",The “Property Control” program at ESF manages a list of surplus items. These surplus items are offered to other departments on campus and to other NYS institutions. The property control program can also obtain surplus items from other state institutions. ,"ESF rarely prints-out hard copy materials. All course catalogs, students’ schedules, and directories are online. Students can access this information via the registrar’s website, Myslice and the ESF online directory.

http://www.esf.edu/help/
","ESF limits students to 500 pages of printed material per year. If the student runs out of printing credits, they can buy another 500 credits for $20.","The ""Ten Tons of Love"" project is where students from Syracuse University (SU) and ESF give their gently used items to those in need at the end of each semester. The semi-annual program donates clothing, household items, cell phones, furniture, nonperishable food, books and school supplies. Students, faculty, staff and community members are encouraged to donate used items in good condition. In the spring of 2009, Ten Tons of Love collected 33 tons of food, clothing, housewares, shoes and books. 15 truckloads of furniture were also collected. Recipients of the donated items include Bethesda Temple Pentecostal Church, First English Food Pantry, Interfaith Works of CNY’s Center for New Americans, Mary Nelson’s Backpack Program, Northside Clothes Closet, Practical Assistance Program, Refugee Resettlement Program and Transitional Living Services. Last year, more than 1,000 individuals benefited from the drive. Drop-off locations include all SU residence halls, Archbold Gym, Hendricks Chapel, the Schine and Goldstein student centers, University College, the Office of Off-Campus and Commuter Services, and Moon Library on the ESF campus.",,Each year the students from GCI perform a waste audit during Earth Week on the college main quad.,"ESF's dining halll (Trailhead Cafe: https://www.facebook.com/ESFtrailhead/?fref=ts ) participates in pre-consumer composting. They generate between two to five, five-gallon buckets of coffee grinds and vegetable peels per day, which a student work-study on staff with our grounds crew picks up from the cafe every day. ","Post-consumer composting has been a student initiative at ESF for the last seven years. In each building there are small green buckets for students, staff and faculty to use. The green buckets are then collected every day by a work study, and brought to a central area on campus for on-campus composting. Over the years, students have experimented with different systems: active aeration, passive aeration, and now vermi-composting combined with mixing into our grounds residues pile (leaves, grass clipping, etc, actively mixed with machinery).","All new students are issued an ESF mug to use at college events as part of the ""Lug a Mug"" program.","The Trailhead Cafe offers an ""Eco To-Go"" program as part of their increasing efforts for a more sustainable and eco-friendly dining experience. These are reusable to-go containers, which can be sanitized in the dishwasher and reused over again. Students purchase the container only once and when it is turned in, they get credit for another.

In its first trial semester (winter-spring 2015), the set of 40 plates, cups and utensils was used approximately 45 times, showing a high success rate. After use at campus events, the plates, cups and utensils are returned to the Cafe and washed and readied for further use. Other initiatives:

- Coffee, milk, cream, and soy milk are stored in reusable thermos containers, displacing the tiny one-serving throw-away creamers.
- Only napkins made from recycled paper are used.

Geneseo Printing Optimization Policy - prohibiting desktop printers","Some of the reuse of materials is guided by SUNY Geneseo's department of Environmental Health Services. For example, materials that could be considered hazardous waste are maintained by EHS until someone wishes to use them. ","Course catalogs, schedules and directories can all be found online and can all be printed by students. Most professors do not print these out for individual students. Course syllabi, lectures, and general materials are available through the online myCourses registry.",Students have to pay per page printed. Each page costs 10 cents (5 cents if it's double sided) for black and white printing. 30 dollars is prepaid via tuition and students can add more money to their accounts as needed. ,"Geneseo partners with Livingston Cares and St. Paulies Textiles to donate unwanted items from students when they move-out of the residence halls. Students are also encouraged to recycle anything that they cannot donate. 

The Geneseo Gives Back program also takes item and food donations from the dormitories and sells them at the Interfaith Tag Sale.   All monetary proceeds from the sale are used to fund the Interfaith Center facility. At the Tag Sale, community members can buy donated items at inexpensive prices.  In this way, donations both reduce waste and serve the members of the Geneseo community. 

Any items unsold at the event are donated to the Geneseo Goodwill store.  All food items are donated to the Geneseo-Groveland Food Pantry, located at St. Mary's church in Geneseo.",The college upholds a recycling standard for antiquated or used items and materials. Equipment removed from service is offered as surplus to other entities or recycled to the extent that it can be.  ,none,"Menu Tracking and Waste Logs are utilized by the culinary teams in all of the kitchens.  Menu Tracking allows the chefs to forecast their menus more accurately, allowing them to prepare only what is needed.  Waste Logs are used to record any pre-consumer waste, as well as the reason for the waste – whether food is out of date, has fallen on the floor, is out of temperature and must be disposed of, or is the result of trimmings.  These reports are analyzed and the results used to identify opportunities to reduce future waste.
Menu style has also played a large role in reducing pre-consumer waste.  An increasing number of food stations have been converted to “made-to-order” stations that prepare each dish individually to the customer’s specifications.  This allows not only for fresher, more customized dishes, but less waste in pre-prepared dishes.
A change in food service equipment also allows for more “batch cooking” in the restaurants; food is prepared and cooked in smaller portion sizes, reducing the amount of overage produced.  
","Trayless dining has been implemented in both of our pay-one-price restuarants (commonly called all-you-care-to-eat or board plan restaurants by other institutions).  Portions have also been reduced in these restaurants while encouraging customers to return to the station for seconds, allowing for a more tapas style dining experience and reducing waste.  In our retail restaurants, different portion size options (such as a half sandwich or panini or a “junior sized” item) are offered.  ","Styrofoam was eliminated from campus dining many years ago and only paper, reusable or compostable to-go containers are offered.  For our grab and go options that are available in the reach in coolers, PlanGlow biodegradable packaging is used for all sandwiches, wraps and salads.","Both of our pay-on-price (otherwise known as all-you-care-to-eat) restaurants use exclusively reusable china, glasses and silverware.  Our retail restaurants utilize reusable serviceware when the restaurant is laid out in a manner that allows for a dishmachine that can properly wash and sanitize reusable serviceware.  A program was initiated that allowed students to purchase reusable to-go containers at cost, and return them to the restaurant to be cleaned.  ","A financial incentive is offered to encourage students and other members of the campus community to use reusable mugs in our retail restaurants.  A $.25 discount is offered on all beverages when using a reusable mug or bottle; this discount applies when any style of mug or bottle is used, it does not need to be a special container that is purchased from the campus.  ","Other programs and initiatives employed by dining services to minimize waste include utilizing napkin dispensers placed on the tables rather than a central napkin dispenser.  When napkins are placed in a central location, customers tend to take more than they need so that they do not have to get back up to get more.  Tests in one location saw a decrease in napkin use by 54%.
Waste vegetable oil is also currently being recycled.  Currently, all waste vegetable oil generated by the fryers on campus is collected and picked up by a company that recycles the product, keeping it out of the waste stream.

Tufts’ Accounts Payable department pays as many vendors as possible via EFT or credit card, thus reducing the printing of paper checks. They also receive many invoices electronically via the EDI –Electronic Data Interchange. These are on-going efforts.

The Tufts Dental school is in the process of moving all patient files over to electronic records. 

Several years ago Tufts' Facilities Services department stopped accepting paper-based requests for work. They also transitioned away from a paper-based Union employee tracking system by introducing mobile technology.  Work request information is also communicated to customers via the web instead of printing reports to email/mail.

UB's recycling program started out in the 1970's and continued until the early 1980's before fading out from lack of interest. Recycling was re-instated in the late 1980's by a group of inspired students with University Facilities support. Their program targeted the best sites for computer and office waste paper. The paper was collected by the students and sorted at a campus loading dock. It was a lot of fun and a lot of work but it resulted in recycling only 5% of UB's solid waste stream.

A few years later, the program was ""institutionalized"" and became the full responsibility of University Facilities paid staff. By 1995, recycling was extended to all offices on both campuses with the distribution of under-the-desk recycling bins and ""trash buddies."" In the meantime, Campus Living developed its own recycling program for UB residence halls. UB Campus Dining & Shops developed a recycling program for its food service areas as well.
During the spring 1998 semester, six students participated in an internship which included a campus-wide dumpster dive and a study of recycling potential in UB's residence halls. The dive and study showed the potential for major improvements in campus recycling programs.  During 1999 and 2000 public area recycling stations were established in select high-traffic indoor public areas on campus, e.g. lobbies, lounges, walkways. Over 100 public area stations were deployed in various locations throughout UB's two campuses in 2001.  In 2011, UB consolidated its three individually managed recycling contracts into a one comprehensive contract for all areas of campus.  It was also at this time, that the campus moved to single stream or All In One recycling collection to simplify the program for members of campus.  This has resulted in significant improvements in promoting participation in our recycling program.  Currently, UB recycles over twenty different materials on campus. 

UB is also committed to reducing the amount of disposable materials purchased and consumed on our campuses and has undertaken several initiatives to support this approach.  Initiatives include eliminating the use of Styrofoam take-out containers in campus-run dining halls, and operating UB SWAP, a web-based program which encourages faculty and staff to keep unwanted equipment and furniture in circulation across campus.

Based on the audit results, the majority of UBC’s operational garbage is recyclable, with the predominant materials being food scraps, paper and plastic.

As part of the development of UBC’s Zero Waste Action Plan, a series of pilot projects including waste audits were conducted to help develop a comprehensive strategy for updating the recycling and composting infrastructure on campus. For example, in 2013 four stream recycling stations were introduced into two of the major libraries on campus, Walter C. Koerner Library and the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. At Koerner library, after replacing a large number of solo garbage cans with fewer, centralized multi-stream recycling stations, overall waste diversion increased from 18% to about 48%. A follow-up pilot in the Geography building then demonstrated an increase in diversion from 35% to 61% though updates to infrastructure and signage.

A student-led “public” waste audit was also conducted to measure waste composition from the Student Union Building, and illustrate the composition of waste to campus users. 

An audit of incoming organic waste at the UBC composting facility was conducted in order to better understand organic waste composition and contamination rates for four different types of facilities generating waste.  

Finally, informal composition audits and detailed weight measurements (including diversion rate calculations) were made in two large student residences as part of pilot projects to increase composting and waste diversion in student housing. 
","UBC Payment and Procurement Services, UBC Food Services, the UBC Bookstore and the Alma Mater Society (AMS) are encouraging vendors to align with UBC’s sustainability objectives. This includes asking vendors to think of creative ways to ship to us, to reuse or recycle packaging, and to plan for leftover materials. UBC Student Housing and Hospitality (including Food Services) continues to work with vendors to maximize the use of reusable packaging and encourage take-back programs. The AMS is in the process of hiring a new Purchasing Manager and plans to review all existing supplier arrangements/agreements and further find opportunities for more sustainable procurement of all goods and materials.

In 2013, a sustainability planning process was undertaken with major operational departments on campus, including UBC Building Operations, Student Housing and Hospitality Services, UBC Information Technology and Payment and Procurement Services. Waste reduction and diversion goals, actions, and metrics were identified and included in the development of department-level sustainability frameworks. 
","Reuse-it UBC (http://www.reuseitubc.ca/) is a virtual online warehouse designed to assist UBC employees to find and exchange low-value items of $1,000 or less between departments (e.g. furniture, audio-visual equipment, office supplies, etc. In 2013-14, there were 61 successful transfers conducted through Reuse-it UBC. 

A working group is currently re-forming to look at how to promote and augment Reuse-it UBC, with the goal of dramatically increasing reuse of this type of equipment. As a step in this process, in Spring 2014, a major “garage sale” was planned to reuse office equipment and furniture in the General Services and Administration Building (GSAB), which is closing for redevelopment. The sale was conducted in Summer 2014 and was highly successful, diverting an estimated 38 tons from the landfill (following the 13-14 fiscal reporting year). 
","As of 2010, UBC discontinued printing annual copies of the UBC Directory. Dependence on the printed version of the UBC Directory has greatly declined, in-line with the increased use of the online version of the directory which is more up-to-date and more accessible. A mobile version of the Directory is now available as well. 

The Vancouver Academic Calendar is a comprehensive guide to all programs, courses, services, and academic policies at UBC and serves as a record of many University academic policies and procedures. The online Calendar is the official Calendar and changes are incorporated online at intervals throughout the year. 

In 2014, the AMS discontinued the print version of the AMS Agenda (student daytimer/calendar). All AMS and related campus resources are now available via AMS App.

Collaboration exists within Student Housing and Hospitality Services between Residence Life and Building Services operations to ensure that communication, marketing and implementation of the program are aligned. The aim is to reduce the volume of waste that reaches the landfill during residence move out by a) creating awareness for students to recycle their unwanted goods and b) making reducing unwanted goods as easy as possible and increasing student participation.

Results indicated a range of contamination rates to be addressed, primarily through food services staff training and engagement. ",UBC Food Services invests in trained and certified chefs which has a direct impact on quality and waste reduction.  Currently in our staff are 11 certified chefs who oversee a culinary portfolio of over 100 who are talented and trained to re-purpose food prep waste into other salable items – like stews or soups.  In addition we have a computer inventory management system that tracks waste and spoilage and our food units are measured on it. Budget targets are set each year and units do monthly inventory and track against the targets set. ,"UBC Food Services' meal plan is a la carte, which enables students to select items and pay for them individually. This type of plan does not incur the same amount of food waste as students pay for what they are consuming and tend to be more conscious of what they are eating versus throwing away.","UBC Food Services single-use containers are either compostable fibre, or recyclable plastic. The majority of food containers are compostable fibre, while some items like lids for compostable soup bowls and cutlery are recyclable plastics. UBC Food services sources compostable products in accordance with ASTM standards D6400 or D6868, BPI, and/or Vincotte OK biobased certification. Compostable containers that are covered through UBC’s Sort It Out program are composted along with food waste at UBC’s In Vessel compost facility. 

In order to encourage the use of alternatives to take-out containers and plastic cutlery, UBC Food Services distributes a reusable container to each resident at Totem and Place Vanier Residence. Students can take advantage of the 15 cent discount for using reusable containers, and avoid the 35 cent charge for the purchase of a disposable container; this works out to a 50 cent saving at each use. UBC Food Services also operates a program called “Eco-to-Go” that encourages reusable containers for meals on the run. http://www.food.ubc.ca/responsibility/

AMS continues to use only 3rd party certified bio-degradable/compostable containers, and hot drink cups and recyclable cutlery and cold drink cups. Although the AMS has offered personal container discounts for many years, the AMS does not offer the exchange program that Food Services has implemented in their dining halls.

The goal of the EPP Road Show is to promote environmentally preferred alternatives to common office supplies. The Zero Waste Research Center chose products that produce less waste than their counterparts or are made out of recycled content. For example, Pilot’s B2P (Bottle to Pen) is a pen made out of recycled plastic water bottles, which means it is a #1 PET plastic and is readily recyclable. Also, it is refillable which allows for the continual use of the pen while only throwing away the empty ink.

At these facilities, UC Davis users (faculty, staff, and students) will accrue charges of 11 cents per sheet for every sheet they print regardless if the printing is single-sided or double-sided. Sheets printed via Wireless Printing are counted on the same quota as normal printing within the IET computer rooms. If an individual prints 30 or fewer sheets per quarter, the charges will be waived as it is not efficient for the department to issue invoices for such small print quantities. Color prints cost $1.00 per page. As student fees do not support student computing nor do they support printing, printing is entirely funded by the fees. The printing fees also fund a portion of the open-access computer labs since they are primarily used for printing.

For students living in the residence halls, Student Housing provides 250 pages “free” printing each quarter through the Computer Centers in the residence hall areas. While “free”, in actuality this is paid for through regular Housing fees paid each quarter. The department set that level of printing as a responsible level that meets the needs of the vast majority of residents with consideration for sustainability and conservation of resources.

The move-in/out event includes stations set up specifically to collect materials for recycling and donations (donation stations are more prevalent during move-out). Spring Cleaning takes place in the residence halls during the week before the halls close for the year, so students - as they prepare to move out - may identify clothing, electronics, and other items that they no longer need or want and turn them in so they will continue to be used by others. ",,"Twice a quarter, UC Davis Dining Services holds two waste audits, one in front of the dishline and one behind the dishline. During each waste audit, a team of UC Davis students and Dining Service employees work together to collect, sort and weigh dining guests’ meal waste at each of our three dining facilities. As our guests brought their plates to the dish return, they were asked to sort their waste into the following categories: “edible food waste” (like coleslaw or a bread stick left on someone’s plate), “inedible food waste” (like a corn cob or a banana peel), “liquid waste” (any liquids, not including ice) and lastly “napkin waste.”","UC Davis Dining Services utilizes a program called Lean Path.  Lean Path helps UC Davis Dining Services divert pre consumer waste by recording production losses through weight measurement. Pre consumer waste encompasses overproduction, expiration and trim waste. During 2013, in Segundo and Tercero Dining Commons, over 7500 trays of food were weighed. According to Lean Path data, we reduced our food cost loss by 50% last year by recognizing heavy wasted items and either producing less or ordering less.  Please note, although each Dining Common provides continuous education and incentives to use the lean path program, not all cooks utilize the program. However, this sample size provides enough data to help Dining Services reduce their waste.","All UC Davis Dining Commons are trayless dining; trays are not available any location. 

UC Davis Dining Services offers several programs that encourage food waste minimization.  The Just Ask program at UC Davis Dining Services provides guests with an option of customizing a prepared dish by encouraging them to request alterations from our chefs. Signs are posted around the Dining Commons reminding students that they can ask for a dish without sides, in a half portion or without a bun.
The Try-a-Taste program at UC Davis provides guests in the all-you-care-to-eat campus dining commons an opportunity to sample a plated entrée or soup before taking an entire serving of food. This helps reduce food waste.

Reusable 4oz china ramekins or 2oz ceramic soup spoons are used as sample vessels. Platform cooks prepare a flight of samples that are available next to the fully plated items or crock of soup. A larger ramekin is available at the point of service for students to discard empty sample cups/spoons.
"," All dining commons and retail eateries have a composting program in place.  A majority of supplies used by the food facilites are recyclable (paper, cardboard, plastics #1-2) or compostable (BPI and ASTM certified compostable).  The supplies selected are based on campus recycling and compostable acceptance standards.

Cuarto Dining Commons offers a “Meals To- Go” program. Students purchase a reusable box with one meal swipe and return the used box to receive another one. Students may only use the reusable boxes provided by Dining Services for their To- Go meal. 

In special events, sometimes to-go containers are used to pack lunch boxes for event attendees. In these cases, composting bins are normally available during the events and the containers are compostable containers (commonly wax-lined paper containers).","All dining commons utilize reusable service ware for ""dine in"" meals. Most retail eateries utilize recyclable or compostable service waste for to-go meals, with the exception of a few meal products. All food facilites are composting facilities.","Discounts are provided to customers who use reusable drinking containers when purchasing coffee or soda in food service facilities on campus. For example, customers get a $0.15 discount campus-wide at all Dining Services operated coffee and beverage locations for providing their own cup or mug.","UC Davis Dining Services is committed to waste reduction and environmental stewardship. We strive to support the UC Davis campus meet the goal of zero waste by 2020.  Each year Dining Services diverts thousands of tons of organic waste, office paper, plastics, glass and metals from the landfill through recycling and composting programs. We are also striving to reduce the overall amount of ‘waste’ generated in our facilities. 

Organic Waste Recycling
All campus dining facilities, including primary retail foodservice locations, are recycling all pre- and post-consumer organic waste into compost or biogas. Organic waste diversion was launched in foodservice locations on campus in 2005. 

All organic waste from the UC Davis Dining Services resident dining commons is being converted into clean energy at the Renewable Energy Anaerobic Digester (READ) operated on the UC Davis Campus by Clean World Partners. 

Pre- and Post-consumer Food Waste Reduction through Education and LeanPath
 Through education and portion control, implementing our Try-a-Taste and Just-Ask programs, UC Davis Dining Services helped students reduce plate waste, also known as post-consumer waste, to 1.84oz per person, nearly reducing plate waste by half since 2010. 

Food waste tracking utilizing LeanPath is utilized in both Segundo (2011) and Tercero (2012) Dining Commons to help reduce pre-consumer waste from overproduction and trim waste.  Learn more about the LeanPath program at http://www.leanpath.com/.

Reducing Non-Recyclable Waste
Aggie Ware, a reusable dishware program, is available for all resident hall programming since 2010 and has helped eliminate disposable, non-recyclable/compostable plate ware from being purchased by residents and resident hall advisers for resident socials. All retail and resident dining locations are plastic-bag free since 2009. 

Zero Waste Concessions at Aggie Stadium
For the fourth year in a row, Dining Services operated the zero-waste concessions program at the UC Davis Aggie Stadium. This year, we achieved an 84% average diversion rate by offering recycling and composting for guests and staff. In the sixth home football game of the season this year against North Dakota, a season high 97% of waste was diverted from the landfill. UC Davis was recognized for having the highest diversion rates in the nation at Aggie Stadium in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s WasteWise Game Day Challenge from 2011-2013.

Zero Waste Events
UC Davis Dining Services continues to work with the campus to strengthen the campus-wide zero waste event program. All events catered by University Catering and Resident Dining are standard zero-waste, meaning that all the service ware provided is either reusable, compostable or recyclable. Our catering team also works with event planners to identify menus that incorporate bulk instead of individually packaged items as much as possible to eliminate unnecessary packaging. 
",http://sustainability.ucdavis.edu/progress/waste_reduction/index.html,"UC Davis has a fairly robust waste reduction and recycling program, including the nation’s first zero waste stadium, and a major organics and food waste diversion program. The campus focus on reducing waste can be traced back to at least 1975, when Bargain Barn opened in an effort to more responsibly dispose of surplus equipment, furniture and supplies.

The campus generates a large amount of organic waste associated with animal science teaching programs, such as the Teaching Dairy, hence the large proportion of composting.

Last football season, UC Davis entered Aggie Stadium into the 2015 Game Day Challenge Competition. As a result, UC Davis was ranked among other Universities and Colleges within the same conference, Division I FCS.  Entrants were ranked in five different categories and UC Davis received one First Place, three Third Place, and one Fourth Place ranking across the five categories.  The categories are below:

1.       Recycling (per capita recycling (lbs/person)) – 3rd place, 0.446 lbs./person (11/14/15, v. Cal Poly)

2.       Waste Minimization (lbs. landfill/person) – 3rd place, 0.217 lbs./person (10/03/15, v. Montana State)

3.       Green House Gas Reduction (MTCO2e/person) – 3rd place, 0.000596 MTCO2e/person (11/14/15, v. Cal Poly)

4.       Organics (per capita organics reduction (lbs./person)) – 4th place, 0.156 lbs./person (11/14/15, v. Cal Poly)

5.       Diversion (Diversion rate %) – 1st place, 97.296% (10/24/15, vs. Southern Utah)

1. Environmentally preferable purchasing underlies and enables all other areas of sustainable practice in this Policy. Therefore, the University will maximize its procurement of environmentally preferable products and services.
2. The University will use its purchasing power to target environmentally preferable products and services for volume-discounted pricing to make them cost-competitive with conventional products and services.
3. For products and services without available environmentally preferable alternatives, the University will work with its existing and potential suppliers and leverage the University’s purchasing power and market presence to develop sustainable choices.
4. The University will integrate sustainability requirements into its practices for competitive bidding in materiel and services procurement, allowing for suppliers that meet these requirements to earn additional evaluation points.
5. Packaging for all products procured by the University should be designed, produced, and managed in an environmentally sustainable manner. The University shall seek products that have take-back programs, as appropriate.
6. When requested, suppliers citing environmentally preferable purchasing claims shall provide proper certification or detailed information on environmental claims, including benefits, durability, and take-back, reuse, and recyclable properties. Additionally, suppliers are responsible for providing proof of University of California-accepted third-party certification based upon the requirements of the University’s Procurement Services Department located in the Office of the President.

This service is provided in UCI Libraries and centrally managed computing labs. Some schools and departments provide some printing to their students on specially located printers.,"UCI has an annual student move-out donation and recycle program each June. The 2015 Move-Out Donation Throwdown program was a two-week-long campaign to raise awareness that reuse is just as important as recycling.  The housing and recycling team, in collaboration with the Goodwill of Orange County, places collection carts inside all dorms and community centers for the six student housing communities (~14,000 people), and these carts are emptied every other day. Additional recycle bins are placed outside the buildings and emptied daily to encourage recycling for things that cannot be donated. Each housing community posts an e-flyer on its website that describes the program and the locations for the collection carts and recycling bins.  The Move Out donation event is advertised on the campus electronic billboards and in the student newspaper, New University.  The event is approached as a competition with the goal of exceeding the prior year’s donations.  The Move Out Donation Throwdown program has gained success every year. In 2010, the  first program collected 67 tons; the 2015 program resulted in 82 tons of  clothing, furniture and electronics being donated to the Goodwill of Orange County.

Our move-in program starts before the students arrive on campus.  Through the new student move-in program students are encouraged to reduce waste prior to coming on campus by reducing overpackaging prior to arrival. We also teach about campus recycle practices at this time. We have a sustainable student guide that is used as part of the new student training. It is sent via email to students as well as posted on the Resident Advisors' bulletin boards.  http://www.fm.uci.edu/files/SustainableStudentHandguide.pdf
During move-in additional cardboard collection bins are placed in dorm areas for the collection of these used move in boxes to be recycled. ","During our campus recycling presentations to students and staff, reduce and re-use is highlighted as preferable to recycling.  Some of the ways we put that into action is through the use of the 140 hydration water bottle filling stations available on campus and in student housing to fill reusable bottles.  Since 2010 the refillable water bottle filling stations have been credited with the reduction of disposable bottle sales by 30%.  Each year these campus bottle filling stations provide more than 298,355 gallons of water, eliminating the use of 2.35 million disposable bottles (equal to 65 tons of plastic waste avoided). Another way the campus encourages waste minimization is by requesting that documents be printed only when necessary. In addition, campus copy machines are set to the default of double sided printing to reduce paper use and waste.","Food waste audits are done to ensure that an uncontaminated food waste stream is provided.  Informal inspections are done at each of the kitchen areas, and more formal audits are done at the Waste Management food waste plant where UCI food waste is processed.  The UCI Hospitality & Dining Sustainability Coordinator and Sustainability Field Study Interns conduct regular waste audits at campus dining locations to prevent waste stream contamination and continually educate both employees and customers about waste diversion.  Food waste tonnage is measured monthly at each location. ","All pre-consumer food waste is weighed, and food management tools are used to track and address excessive pre-consumer food waste.  All 3 campus dining commons and 23 campus restaurants have a pre-consumer food waste collection program.  In the kitchens, all pre-consumer food waste is placed into a clear container prior to being added to the campus food composting program.  The clear bin is weighed and logged.  The dining manager looks at the clear container to determine if the waste could have been minimized.  The dining manager coaches the crew on ways to minimize food waste for the future.  This technique has helped to reduce food waste.  The pre-consumer food waste is then added to the campus food composting program. Each dining facility has an outside bin dedicated to the collection of this material.  In 2015 the campus food composting program was responsible for keeping 666.9 tons of food scaps out of landfills.","Trays have been eliminated in all dining locations except for use by students who have physical disabilities; trays are available to this group on request.  The trayless system reduces waste by encouraging students to take only the food they can hold on one plate and  to come back if they want more.  Tastings and half portions are encouraged so the students can see if they like the food item before selecting a full portion. 

Weigh the Waste is a bi-quarterly event held in the on-campus dining commons.  The purpose of the event is to educate students about the environmental impact of food waste and to empower the students about how they can alter the footprint they leave behind. Students can see directly how much food is wasted in a single meal period. Green Captains also provide students with simple tips to reduce food waste and celebrate successes when students come to the bins with no waste.

In 2013 the first pilot program for a post-consumer food waste program was completed at our Phoenix Grill dining facility.  The program consists of a three-bin system for compost, commingled recycling and landfill material. The bins are in both the inside and outside dining area.  The bin signs are all in images and at eye level.  The program was so succesful that Phoenix Grill is now a certified Zero Waste Facility.  This program has been expanded at the East Food Court and BC Cavern.  These facilities are not at 95% diversion yet but have significantly improved their diversion rate for post-consumer waste.   

In 2015, seven large-scale campus events were conducted as Zero Waste Events.   Each event had more than 3,500 people in attendance with food and beverages served.  The events feature three bins and student volunteers known as ""trash talkers"" who stand by the bins and help attendees place items in the correct bins as well as answer questions about the campus recycling program. Each event achieved a 90% or better diversion rate.   

In 2015 food composting programs were implemented in student housing in both dorm style and apartment style homes.  Each kitchen now has a 3- or 6-gallon compost bin supplied to the residents. Since the start of the program we have seen a 67 ton improvement in food waste collection. ","Reusable to-go containers are sold at cost at all of the residential dining locations and can be used at all food locations on campus. In addition, these containers were given to many of our incoming freshman. In total, more than 3,000 students now have reusable to-go containers and are using them. Reusable to-go containers are dropped off for cleaning by our students at all residential dining locations. Any leftover food in the container is deposited in the food waste bins. Students returning containers are reissued a clean container. This is a hugely successful program.  Annually, more than 200,000 disposable to-go containers have been eliminated.  To-go containers at Organic Greens to Go are made using recycled content.  All to-go containers at other campus dining locations on campus are biodegradable.","UCI Hospitality & Dining offers a Reusable To-Go Program, which allows students to take meals to-go in a reusable to-go container. Students can then exchange the used container for a clean one at any time or exchange it for a Rain Check card for convenience. All dine-in service ware and plate ware is reusable.","Over the last three years, more than 7,500 reusable water bottles were distributed to first-year freshman for re-use in our dining locations.

UCI Hospitality & Dining offers a discount with the use of reusable cups, mugs, bottles, etc. This discount is available for coffee and fountain drinks on campus at locations that offer those beverages. Java City: Customers pay only $1.49 for coffee when they bring their own 20 oz. or less sized mug/cup (good at all locations) and receive a 10-cent discount on espresso-crafted beverages (at Cyber A ecoGrounds and Java City Kiosk).  Einstein Bros Bagels: Customers pay only $1.49 for coffee when refilling 16 oz. or 20 oz. cups. Starbucks: Customers get a 10 cent discount when they bring their own mugs.","Receiptless transactions are implemented at campus dining locations, with receipts available only upon request or where a signature is needed.

Food management tools allow UCI Hospitality & Dining to prevent 15% of food waste through source reduction.

The Weigh the Waste program has also helped year-to-year waste minimization through better education of employees and managers about portioning and food purchasing.

UCI Hospitality & Dining diverted 115 tons of food waste in 2015 through source reduction by purchase, storage and handling and 17 tons of food waste by avoiding over-preparation and plate waste.

...Printed invitations can be replaced with E-vites, hard copy newsletters with email versions, etc.

Such efforts reduce costs and serve UCLA's sustainability objectives.  A reduction of print and proper utilization of electronic media also can be more effective, as well as less expensive.”

UCLA is also looking into campus-wide savings in printing and publications.","All major UCLA libraries and associated computer labs charge students and visitors for all printing including Powell library, Charles E Young Research library, and the UCLA law library.

There are some computer labs, like the Social Science Computing lab, which provide students taking a full course-load of classes, the opportunity to print up to $10 worth of free printing per quarter, but charge for any additional printing.

The signs outline the environmental benefits of dining without a tray.

Many of the residential dining halls serve meal items in small portions to reduce waste. Students are taught to go back for seconds if they need more food, rather than getting a larger portion during the first trip.

Years prior to 2007, waste generation data was not collected from all entities on campus, especially departmental programs. ","UCSB regularly conducts waste audits by utilizing the services of UCSB's Associated Students Recycling (A.S. Recycling), third party environmental consulting firms, and their waste hauler. A.S. Recycling provides waste audit services for special events, departments, and buildings. Recently, A.S. Recycling audited the waste generated from the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference. Third party consulting firms generally audit waste from buildings, often as part of the LEED certification process, and the waste hauler audits UCSB as an entirety once a year.

A baseline food waste audit was conducted by interns in Winter Quarter (on weekends).   They compare the weights to spring quarter audits after posting signs about reducing food waste.  The results did not show a significant savings but they did conduct audits both quarters.
","To reduce food waste, UCSB strives to cook from scratch and also purchases in bulk, but it ensures that the items are used before their expiration date and that too much food is never bought too far in advance. When possible, ingredients are used in multiple meals. For example, chicken bones and vegetables trimmings are used to make stocks. UCSB also composts all of its pre-consumer food waste, ensuring that it is not sent to the landfill but is re-purposed as compost instead. ","In fall quarter of the 2009-2010 school year, Residential Dining removed trays from all four dining commons.

Since removing trays from dining facilities, UCSB has seen a 54% reduction in post consumer food waste and a 37% average savings of total waste overall. There has been a reduction of approximately 2,400,000 pounds in solid waste. The amount of wasted food found on trays also went from 6% down to less than 3%. Further reductions included saving ~1,000,000 gallons/year of water, and chemical use from washing trays was also reduced substantially. Additionally, all trays were donated to various facilities, including schools, the Santa Barbara Rescue Mission, and UCSB Life Science and Biology labs. The total number of trays donated was 3,952.

We use these events to educate the campus community and determine which items people have difficulty recycling.,"The university attempted to reduce packaging on a 2013 computer refresh however the extra shipping, time, and costs were unacceptable.","The university uses a listserve for both faculty and staff  to redistribute office supplies that can be reused. Items  are diverse, from folders, printer cartridges, furniture, computers, monitors, etc. The listserve is used frequently and items turn over very quickly. Being in lean budget situations ensures that all materials are re-used and do not end up in the landfill. ","Many items are available on line now throughout the university and many electronic forms are added each year. These include catalogs, research in the library, financial aid, budgeting forms and reports, timesheets, pay advices, etc.","Several years ago UCCS instituted the Pawprints program which charges for prints in all computer labs and the library on campus. Between the pay for printing and the double-sided printing default settings, paper consumption in the labs has been reduced by over 50 percent.","Each year 2 Goodwill trailers are provided on campus during the week of move-out to provide students with a way of donating reusable goods, including electronics. There is also an opportunity, through a local electronics recycler, for students to get rid of unused electronics. Extra recycling bins are provided during the week to encourage waste diversion.
During move-in recycling bins were added in more locations and cardboard was collected and baled.",,Food waste audits are done periodically by Sodexo and students in housing. They are also sometimes done as a part of course work. ,Sodexo at UCCS has agreed to invest in and is participating in a pilot program introducing Lean Path. This is a program designed to track food waste within the food service operation. A view of the program can be seen here: http://leanpath.com/. Scales are in each of the kitchens at prep areas and all pre-consumer waste is measured and tracked.,"In August 2010 UCCS with Sodexo instituted a trayless program in the Lodge, which serves all of the 900 residential students in a cafeteria style all you can eat manner. There are no longer trays in the facility which has reduced the amount of food waste significantly.

","In September 2010 UCCS with Sodexo instituted the Clyde's Carryout program in the Clyde's venue. Participants have been provided containers free of charge for this semester. Containers are exchanged with Clyde's chips, which can then be redeemed for a clean container. Additionally, in catering, customers can now order box lunches that are served in the reusable containers. All styrofoam has been discontinued. All conatainers are now compostable.
Coffee vendors on campus are still a mix of recyclable, compostable, and landfill containers.","All of the dining facilities on campus use reusable dining ware. All of the materials for to-go meals are third party certified compostable and are directed to composting receptacles. This includes all of the service ware for catering. 
",Sodexo provides all campus dining operations on campus. There is a discount at all outlets on campus for using reusable mugs. The discount is 42 percent for a regular coffee. There is also a similar discount for refilling fountain drinks using a reusable Sodexho cold mug.,"Sodexo is encouraged to use bulk condiments, cream, and to avoid individual packets.

","25 hydration stations have been installed on campus, which promotes reusable water bottles.  Over the next fiscal year, UConn aims to install 25 more hydration stations.","EcoHusky student group conducts an annual food waste study. Each year, the study is done in a difference dining hall. Volunteers collect food waste in a bin as students leave the dining hall. The food is weighed and the amount of food waste per individual student is calculated. The data is compiled and displayed in the various dining halls to encourage students to be conscience of the amount of food they are taking each meal.","Dining Services uses Somat’s eCorect decomposers in five of its dining halls to reduce the volume of pre- and post-consumer food waste by 70%.  The units dehydrate food waste from preparation areas, including produce and meat products. Currently, the end products are sent to UConn’s Spring Valley Student Farm or are discarded.  During 2015, the eCorects processed 87,300 pounds of food waste, which reduced the volume of waste to 26,190lbs.","The eCorects process post-consumer waste that is derived from our dish rooms. These are currently processing approximately 34,848 gallons. 
Also, all dining halls on campus, are now trayless.  This program was implemented after a study at one of the dining halls, which found that trayless dining reduces food waste by 30% and reduces energy and water consumption (dishwashing) by 20 - 25%. This study was conducted at Whitney dining hall, where dinner meals were monitored over a three-week period. Week one, they measured waste, energy consumption and water usage with trays, the second week with ""trayless"" education, and the final week, without using trays. At The final dining hall (South) had its trays removed this past year resulted in 150-200 gallons of water saved per day.

EcoHusky student organization has conducted annual food waste studies and has calculated the average food waste per student per meal is equal to 1.8 ounces. These studies promote conscious eating and serve as a visual so students can see how quickly food waste accumulates.

","Patrons can request a free recyclable, reusable food container at our Union Street Market Food Court. Food is placed in the clean, sanitized container. After eating, patrons place the used container into a U-Recycle bin located in front of the food court. Each container is made of 100% BPA free polypropylene, incorporated with Microban and is NSF approved.
",All dining halls use reusable dishware and cutlery.  Students can also order meals in reusable containers from the Union Street Market Food Court.,"By using a refillable mug, each student can prevent unnecessary waste, reduce paper demand and save money in the process. A coffee refill costs a $1.20 regardless of size compared to the following: $1.55 (small), $1.85 (medium), $2.05 (large). This is a 20-40% discount. A tea refill costs $0.55 regardless of size compared to the following: $1.25 (small), $1.60 (medium), $1.80 (large). This is a 60-70% discount.
In addition to the mug discount, students can also reduce waste by asking for a reusable food container called a “green piece” when ordering at any food station in the Student Union or at One Plate, Two Plates.  Once done eating, the students place the container in the green piece return box, which is sanitized and reused by the Union.  Students can save money through this program by purchasing a “Green Piece Elite Card.”  The card has an initial fee of $5, but each time the student uses a green piece with their Elite Card, they receive a $0.25 discount.  The program pays for itself after 20 uses.
","In partnership with UConn Dining Services and UConn Community Outreach, Food Recovery collects and delivers surplus food to the Covenant Soup Kitchen in Willimantic, CT. Every weekday morning student volunteers arrive at the Library’s Bookworms Café to collect any prepackaged foods like salads and sandwiches that were not sold during the previous day. Bookworms receives all the unsold food products from all UConn Cafes as it is the last one to close. The volunteers then drive the food to the Covenant Soup Kitchen. Students also collect food from Putnam and Towers dining halls. This is food that has not been put out to serve yet and is not made up of salad bar items. Food is transported in cambro containers or produce bags depending on the type of food being donated. Volunteers usually pick food up once or twice a week from Uconn Dining Halls. Food safety is the number one priority as Food Recovery is careful to keep track of the temperatures of the food en route from UConn to Willimantic. 
Additionally, napkins have been moved off the dining hall tables and put in centralized dispensers. During the pilot program in 2014, two dining units moved the napkin dispensers and demonstrated $4,000 in savings, resulting in the use of 286,000 fewer napkins.  Now, the program extends to other dining halls as well, minimizing napkin use in cafeterias.

In addition, in 2013, UofL opened a permanent year-round Free Store staffed by volunteers in Unitas Hall.  
","In 2013, the Sustainability Council convened a new committee to take our existing programs to the next level. Phase I of our “Mini Bin” Garbage Reduction and Single Stream Recycling program are in place and the program has been the major factor in increasing recycling rates across the University, particularly in the areas of cardboard, paper, aluminum, glass and plastic. While the numbers have increased every year since the program’s inception in 2009, there are areas that need to be improved, including:

    Promotion of recycling programs - increasing awareness, understanding of program, individual prompts to increase recycling
    Changing University-wide culture to normalize recycling through behavioral change and institutional change
    Improving current methods and discovering new opportunities to reuse items University-wide
    Developing university-wide goals and systems to measure progress and provide feedback to the University community
    Custodial staff training, development of policies regarding waste disposal, performance review standards, etc.
    Identification of specific waste streams that can be minimized or eliminated, including modifications in purchasing habits
    Recycling at special events, including sports venues, conferences, catering, other large events
    Expanding pre- and post-consumer food waste composting","UofL Dining hosts an annual ""Weigh The Waste"" lunchtime campaign to raise awareness at The Ville Grill during UofL Sustainability Week. During lunch on one day last  year, 198 pounds of food waste was collected for composting! ","In 2012, the University contracted with Blue Skies Recycling (now QRS Recycling) to collect pre-consumer food waste from dining locations.  The first year, over 120 tons were diverted from the landfill.  In the performance year (2014), the University diverted 180 tons from the landfill.","Our first residential dining facility opened in the summer of 2010 and provides no trays to diners. This all-you-care-to-eat facility provides plated meals that are carried back to tables without trays. In 2013, a program was started to collect post-consumer food waste from select Campus Housing locations. In addition, in 2015 a program was implemented where volunteers in the SAC food court helped sort waste and food at trash stations during Summer Orientation sessions and other special events.","The new Cardinal Burger Company on the second level of the Student Activities Center not only features local food and grass-fed, hormone- & antibiotics-free beef, but everything CBC serves and everything it is served on is compostable! When the CBC first opened in the fall of 2013, we experimented with having a compost bin available to customers, but we had to discontinue that program because of constant contamination with landfill trash. 

A new to-go program was implemented in Fall 2015 at the Ville Grill using reusable containers that participants are instructed to return to the dining hall to for cleaning and exchange.","We offer trayless dining with real plates, glasses, and silverware at The Ville Grill, our all-you-care-to-eat dining hall at 3rd & Brandeis, open to all students, employees and the public. This helps to reduce the amount of trash produced and food wasted (our eyes are often bigger than our stomachs!), as well as the resources that would be used to wash the trays.",Reusable mugs and bottles are available for purchase from dining services and customers are permitted to bring their own mugs from home. Any reusable mug can be refilled at any dining services fountain location for a discount price of 99 cents.,"1. Zero-Waste Reusable To-Go Club: In Fall 2015, we launched a brand new take-out service in truly sustainable style – without adding to the waste stream!! Students, faculty and staff can purchase a Ville Grill To-Go Club membership in person at The Ville Grill for just $9.99. Membership earns you a reusable container, unlimited washing of the container, and compostable cutlery & napkins, should you need them.
2.  When available, we donate left-over food to The Lord’s Kitchen and Wayside Christian Mission.  Once a year, Sodexo sponsors an event called Helping Hands that raises awareness about hunger and accepts student donations for our local food bank. Last year students and faculty at the university teamed-up to donate nearly 7,000 pounds of food to Dare to Care.
3.  We are working with Food Recovery Network (likely in the spring) which would replace the food drive with Dare to Care.

The CAP established increasing waste diversion as one of 40 plus strategies in the plan to move the university toward carbon neutrality. Targets of 60% and 75% waste diversion were set for 2010 and 2013 respectively; both targets were met on time.,"Facilities Management recently hired an independent contractor to conduct a waste audit of both the trash and recycling streams of select campus residence halls, all three campus dining halls, and the campus student union. Student Affairs used results to gauge the effectiveness of the current recycling program and to determine the possible volume that could be diverted by expanding collection of compostable materials.  In 2016-2017, Dining Halls will no longer allow takeout and this change is expected to increase food waste composting and significantly decrease waste from disposable containers.

Twice a  year Facilities Management conducts internal waste audits using campus student groups.  These internal waste audits help to teach students about proper waste separation and to gauge the overall effectiveness of the waste diversion program.  ","The ""University of Maryland Policies and Procedures for Environmentally Preferable Procurement"" is a document outlining all implemented policies to prevent waste.  The document ""encourages procurement of environmentally preferable goods and services including, but not limited to:  Existing surplus property and materials for re-use, Energy efficient equipment and appliances, Renewable energy supplies, Energy performance contracts, Environmentally sensitive design and construction of new and renovated facilities, Materials having recycled content, Water saving equipment and appliances, recyclable products, compostable materials, non-hazardous materials and biodegradable products.""

http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/VIII-310C.pdf","Terrapin Trader serves as the University of Maryland's surplus redistribution center. Once labeled as surplus, items such as lab equipment, chairs, tables, computers, monitors, and other items are collected by Terrapin Trader and resold. The office is open to students, staff, and faculty, both to drop off and purchase surplus products. Auctions are also held. In addition to these services, Terrapin Trader also participates in an ""Adopt-a-School"" program. Under this program, Terrapin Trader works with one elementary school, one middle school, and one high school from the surrounding area each year and addresses their needs using the surplus products they have acquired. ","The entire University of Maryland course catalog, complete with course schedules and instructor information, is available online. Class selection and registration are done exclusively online through Testudo. ","To print in most computer labs or libraries on campus, students must pay a small fee for each print job. The prices are as follows: Black and white print jobs cost 10 cents per page for one-sided documents, and 14 cents per page for two-sided documents. These prices are increased to 50 and 70 cents, respectively, for color-printer jobs. Patrons can pay to print using Terrapin Express (a university payment system) or by purchasing a photocopy access card. ","UMD’s “Trash to Treasure” donation drive is a partnership with Goodwill, Student Government Assocition, Residence Hall Association, Residential Facilities, Resident Life and the campus Recycling Group in Facilities Management. Collection stations are set up around campus to collect donated material from residents as they move out of the halls. Donated materials include TVs, clothes, small pieces of furniture, small appliances, and carpets. In addition, ""Terrapin Junktion"", a community yard sale during Move-Out, provides an outlet for unwanted goods and benefits the surrounding College Park community by offering low prices for household goods.","The university has adopted the Mini Bin trash collection program.  All university employee work stations have a mini trash can that the campus employee must empty into a communal trash can and a recycling bin that university housekeepers service.  This program encourages all university staff to be mindful of all the waste they are generating and be responsible for properly disposing of it themselves.  All administrative and academic buildings on campus have adopted this program.

Many university offices and departments also participate in the Green Office program.  This is a voluntary program aimed at promoting sustainable activities.  Many action items to become certified a Green Office encourages waste reduction.  Examples of these action items include: pledging to cancel unwanted catalogs and junk mail, eliminating disposable dishware for personal use and at office meeting and events, using inter-office envelopes for campus mailings, and buying coffee, condiments, and other kitchen supplies in bulk to reduce packaging waste.  
http://www.sustainability.umd.edu/content/culture/green_offices.php",In Fall 2014 the University of Maryland hired an independent contractor to conduct an analysis of the waste stream generated by various facility types within the Division of Student Affairs.  The primary objective of the analysis was to estimate types and quantities of recyclable components in the waste stream and compare results to the previous analyses conducted in 2002 and 2008. The contractor identified areas where there has been an increased effort to divert recyclables through waste sorting and collecting information on waste and recycling from faculty.,"There are multiple policies in place to reduce the food waste, prep waste and spoilage in pre-consumer food in all dining facilities at the University of Maryland. Everything is cooked to order, reducing leftovers and waste. Staff training focuses on reduction of spoilage through appropriate labeling and management of inventory. There is emphasis on the ""first-in, first out"" method to ensure that all product is used effectively. Micro-filtration is used on cooking oils to extend their lifespan. This has reduced the use of cooking oils by over 50%. Used cooking oils are sent to Greenlight Biofuels to be converted into biodiesel fuel.  Produce, specifically vegetables, are purchased whole from distributors and prepared based on need for unit. This extends the shelf-life of the produce. ","Composting food waste takes place in four major locations: the Diner, South Campus Dining Room, 251 North, and at the Stamp Student Union. There are also a few other buildings on campus where occupants separate food and paper towel waste from recyclables and trash, including the Center for Young Children, a large office building and some residence halls. All composted waste is hauled and tracked (in tons) by Facilities Management and reported back to the campus community in the Office of Sustainability's annual Progress Report. 

Food that has been prepared and cannot be effectively reused in the dining halls (but is still safe for consumption) is donated to those in need through our partnership with the Food Recovery Network. The Food Recovery Network is a network of student groups and individuals at UMD volunteering to recover the surplus food from the dining halls and sports games and donate it to hungry men, women and children in the DC area.
","All takeout containers from the dining halls are compostable or reusable. Composting is available in the dining halls, the student union and in some residence halls. Reusable takeout containers are returned to the dining halls for cleaning. 
","All utensils, trays, plates, bowls and cups are reusable for dine-in meals. There is a reusable carryout container program. All of the disposable carryout containers and utensils are either compostable or recyclable. ","Students, faculty and staff that use reusable cups for any fountain beverages and coffee/tea/etc in the dining halls, shops, and cafes across campus will receive a $.20 discount. Students who participate in the reusable carryout program also receive a financial benefit by paying a one-time fee (reusable carryout) rather than a per transaction fee (disposable carryout).  ","Dining Services partnered with student groups to launch a ""bag the bag"" marketing initiative to reduce the use of plastic bags on campus. Staff training, informational signage, and event promotions were used to change campus behavior. Additionally, excess, working equipment and supplies are sold through Terrapin Trader or used at another location on campus. Equipment beyond repair is used for parts and recycled.",http://www.sustainability.umd.edu/content/campus/recycling.php,"The increase is solid waste generation is due largely to new construction and campus renovation projects. Until recently, much of the construction and demolition waste stream was not accurately tracked. During the baseline year (2005), reported data may  not capture all of the construction related waste because tracking was not as thorough as it is now.

In the baseline year (2005) the university re-sold a research vessel, making the tonnage of reused, donated or re-sold waste notably higher than in subsequent years.

Sod and soil from construction was not included in these calculations.

Full-time equivalent of distance education students  has not yet been included in UMD's calculations for this credit because accurate data is not currently available to the Office of Sustainability for the baseline year. This will be updated once accurate data becomes available. A small percentage of UMD students by headcount (estimated at less than 1% of FTE enrollment) are enrolled only in distance education courses."

By including environmental   considerations in our procurement decisions, along with our traditional concerns with price, performance and availability, we will remain fiscally responsible while promoting products and services that have a reduced effect on human health and the environment.

UNL’s “Green Purchasing” strategy is to develop policies consistent with the following:

1. Minimize the consumption of natural resources by reviewing current and proposed future usage and evaluating the pros and cons of alternatives.
2. Seek alternatives to products and processes that are detrimental to the environment  by using more “environmentally friendly” products and processes.
3. Minimize waste, including any packaging, waste produced by the product (or service) in questions, and waste generated by the eventual disposal of the product.
4.Maximize the reuse and recycling of materials.
Stimulate demand for “environmentally friendly” products by letting manufacturers and suppliers know the environmental performance we are looking for in products.","UNL Inventory Department disposes property by transferring it to a different department or institution, trading it in, though public sales, or by salvaging it.

","In 2011 UNL hired a consultant study food waste on campus. The purposes of the study were to:
-define the potential bio-waste sources in terms of quantity and characteristics of the waste generated;
-Provide a general review of available materials conveyance techniques and processing requirements for the bio-waste;
-Provide an opinion of probable costs for the construction, operations, and maintenance of the most technically feasible delivery and pre-processing options; 
-Provide a comparative economic analysis of the project options.

Such locations are monitored by a computer lab technician, and students are instructed to limit their use of free printing to five pages. ","UNH has instituted many strategic activities to reduce the amount of waste produced on campus. Recycle Everything New & Used (RENU) was a volunteer-run program started at UNH by a student in 2002. The Ecological Advocates student organization now facilitates RENU. In 2009, RENU collected a total of 2,220 lbs of clothes and shoes for Planet Aid by placing collection boxes throughout campus dormitories. Students use these boxes to discard nonperishable foods and unwanted clothing. RENU donated 20 boxes of food of a variety of types with an average weight of 25 pounds per box and a total of 500 pounds to the Cornucopia Food Pantry in Durham. Recent years have seen as much as 4,800 pounds of food collected. Kitchen items are also donated to the Good Will in nearby Dover.

In an effort to reduce UNH’s impact on landfills, the UNH Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC) initiated a program called Trash 2 Treasure (T2T) in 2010, which absorbed UNH-RENU.  T2T collects furniture, electronics and other reusable items that students throw away each year, storing it all over the summer, and then holds a large 3-day yard sale during move-in weekend to sell it all back to students.

During move-out in May, the Department of Housing and Residential Education and the Office of Waste Reduction and Recycling set up donation stations in each residence hall or community. Residents may donate clothing, office supplies, personal care items, furniture, appliances, books, and food. In 2015, the move-out donation stations collected approx. 22 tons of these items. 

Since 2012, donations are picked up and used by Durham-based non-profit TROSA (Triangle Residential Options for Substance Abusers), which uses the items in their residential treatment programs or multiple reuse businesses. Broken electronics are sent for recycling to American Greenz in Durham, and used bedding is donated to Paws4Ever, a local no-kill animal shelter. Off campus students could take their extra items to the county's Reuse Rodeo and multiple convenience centers.

DHRE and OWRR promote the donation stations using a social marketing campaign--“Don’t Ditch It. Donate It!”-- throughout residence hall and campus media. ","UNC competes in the Game Day Challenge, a friendly competition between colleges 
and universities to see which institution can reduce and recycle the most waste from a single home football game. UNC received a Carolina Recycling Association Award for its achievements in 2011. UNC participated in the first RecycleMania Basketball Game Day Challenge and performed a waste audit after a home basketball game in 2013. ","Since 2010, the Office of Waste Reduction and Recycling and various student volunteers have conducted waste assessments in a wide range of campus spaces. Preliminary waste audits indicate that compostable materials are still the largest part of the waste stream. Food waste, food-soiled paper, compostable bio-plastics, and other organics were found to constitute up to 49% of the waste stream. In some buildings, more than 75% of the discards could be recycled or composted. OWRR, along with partners in Carolina Dining Services, Athletics, and student government are exploring ways to capture more compostable materials. ","Carolina Dining Services collects food scraps for composting from Rams Head and Lenoir Dining Halls, the Beach Café, Alpine Bagel Café, Wendy’s, the Friday Center, and select Carolina catering events.

The resulting poster emphasizes all the resources required to prepare a plate of food. Diners in both dining halls encounter this message every time they clear the table and approach the dish line. The absence of trays since 2007 also encourages students to take smaller portions and return for seconds rather than generate food waste. ,"Since 2009, both dining halls provide reusable food containers for students on meal plans. (Non-meal plan members and students who lose their first container may purchase a container for $3.50.) Once used, the container is exchanged for a clean and sanitized unit. This three-compartment, polypropylene clamshell is now the only to-go container in use at the dining halls. Since the program's inception, approximately 76,000 Styrofoam containers have been eliminated annually. The reusable containers are stackable, break resistant, dishwasher safe, microwave safe for reheating, BPA free, recyclable (#5 plastic) and can withstand temperatures ranging from 32 to 180 degrees.","All “dine in” meals are served on reusable dishes and eaten with reusable flatware. The plates and cups at the Top of Lenoir Dining Hall are made in part of bamboo, a renewable resource.

At the conclusion of the event it is evident on how many recyclables were in the dumpster. Dumpsters that are audited can be Recycling Dumpsters, to determine how much contamination is present, or Trash Dumpsters, to focus on how many recyclables were lost.

Further, smaller scale audits at the office level are part of the baseline measurements for the Green Office Program.",,"UNCG has two programs to address surplus goods. The first, SpartanSwap, allows individuals to post items a department no longer needs to a university website for claim prior to being moved to the surplus warehouse or the landfill. SpartanSwap is entirely user-maintained, giving employees the ability to add or delete campus-wide listings for items as they are procured by or delivered to other departments.

In the second program, surplus items are offered by UNCG Warehouse Services. Surplus property that is not claimed within the SpartanSwap program, as well as other surplus goods, are stored at the warehouse and made available free of charge via transfer to campus departments. The property is also offered to other state agencies and not-for-profit organizations. Finally, the general public may purchase these items during monthly Public Surplus Sales.

The ""Got Surplus?"" program streamlines this process. Warehouse Services has created this online inventory that is updated as new items are submitted. This inventory can be viewed online by any UNCG employee. When a new item is submitted, an automated email is sent to the warehouse with dynamically generated barcodes for the item. Users receive an email copy of their submission so no paper form is needed. This allows the warehouse staff to accurately track items that move through the warehouse and to the public sale.","The Registrar's office does not print undergraduate course catalogs or course schedules, and the campus phone directory has not been printed since 2007.

However, students are allocated 75 free pages per semester (40 pages for summer) in Information Technology Services-sponsored labs, including the Superlab located in Jackson Library.","UNCG's Office of Waste Reduction and Recycling (OWRR) oversees a program called ""Cram and Scram"" to reduce waste generated during move-out. At the end of each Spring semester, roll-carts are placed in the lobbies of each residence hall where students may place (""Cram"") unwanted items that are in good condition before they leave (""Scram"") for the summer.

All items donated through the Cram & Scram drive are later sold in a rummage sale — proceeds from the sale fund student scholarships to environmental conferences and other environmental learning opportunities, including Earth Day.",,,"Project Clean Plate encourages students to reduce food waste by only taking the amount of food they will eat. Graphs are posted in the campus dining center which represent the amount of food waste produced at UNCG. To supplement this, Dining Services displays plates of uneaten and wasted food on a tables near the waste conveyors so patrons get an idea of how much food is wasted. Dining Services believes that through setting goals, educating diners, giving rewards and making charitable contributions, Project Clean Plate helps raise social awareness on campus.

","As part of a negotiation for the University's waste and recycling contract, a comprehensive waste audit was conducted in September 2014.  More than 30 team members consisting of Representatives from the University's current waste and recycling contractor, University staff, and student volunteers visited each campus building to evaluate the current container sizes, pull frequencies, and collection processes, and make recommendations for improvements.  Recommended improvements were incorporated into the final contract.  On September 1, 2015 the University converted its recycling streams into a single stream recycling program. The conversion includes all campus facilities and cost centers.","Pitt encourages sustainable purchases that include products and materials that are reusable, refillable, and rechargeable; that are made from recycled or remanufactured materials; that were made using environmentally sound practices; whose transfer or shipping process includes minimal packaging waste and avoids air shipping if possible; and that, if they cannot be reused or recycled, can be disposed of in a manner safe to people and the environment.  

The Purchasing Department has also worked with service providers and vendors to reduce waste related to packaging and transportation.  For example, cardboard boxes were replaced by reusable paper bags for delivery of office supplies, and nearly all food and beverage packaging on Pitt's campus through Dining Services is biodegradable. 

The Facilities Management Division works with the University's Purchasing Department to write specifications and negotiate contracts for waste and recycling contracts with local providers.  Qualified providers are asked to present their recommendations for maximizing diversion rates while providing efficient and effective service levels.  The University's waste and recycling contract was recently re-negotiated, and extensive analysis was conducted to ensure the best available levels of service.

","The University's Surplus Property Department provides University Departments with an economical way to purchase good quality used office furniture and equipment, thus reducing the amount of new items purchased while also diverting usable products from going to landfills.  The service is a convenient way for the university community to dispose of unwanted items including electronics, furniture, miscellaneous items, and even vehicles.  Surplus Property collects used items from University departments, refurbishes them if necessary, and sells them at a much reduced price to other units.  Credits are then provided back to the sourcing departments.  Items that cannot be sold are often donated to local charitable organizations.  See http://www.pittsurplus.com/

","General course catalogs and more major-specific course catalogs are all available online. Course schedules and scheduling are available in the ""Student Center"" of each student's online self-service Pitt accounts.  These self-service accounts enable incoming students to activate their network account information via an online portal, saving the paper traditionally associated with that process and cutting the University's carbon footprint by reducing the amount of mail that must be transported by truck and airplane.

Pitt's Read Green service allows more than 13,200 faculty and staff members to receive paper-based mailings as a digital link delivered to their e-mail inbox.  In addition to reducing paper waste, the program reduces the University's carbon footprint by reducing the need to transport University mail by truck both on the Pittsburgh Campus and among the University's four regional campuses.  To date, the program has helped to save more than 10 tons of paper, the equivalent of 170 trees.   ","When Pitt students need to print, they send their documents to one of a growing number of self-service printing stations across campus.  These stations - located in residence halls, campus computing labs, the Student Union, and other heavily traveled student areas - have helped to cut down on the quantity of sheets of paper that are printed and then discarded.   Before documents are printed, the student must physically go to the station and swipe his or her Pitt ID card.  All print jobs from university computers are set to print double-sided as the default. Additionally, students are limited to 900 sheets of paper per semester before a fee is assessed for additional printing. ","Clutter for a Cause is an event that takes place during finals week of fall and spring semesters. This event allows students who are moving out the opportunity to donate their unwanted electronics, clothing, and food.  In addition, members of Pitt's Green Team are present during move-in to collect cardboard boxes for recycling. ","Pitt's ""Give a Thread"" campaign http://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/pittserves/give-thread, attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the most clothing collected for donation or recycle in 2015.  In addition, a student run ""University of Thriftsburgh"" store was recently established in a University building for students to donate and purchase gently used apparel and accessories.  Excess items that cannot be sold are donated to Goodwill Industries.","The University's Fair Food Cooperative Club and food service provider Sodexo are working together on the Real Food Challenge, a campaign to increase procurement of real food (sourced from sustainable, local and fair sources) on college and university campuses, with a goal of 20 percent real food on campuses nationwide by 2020.  Activities have included events to educate students on real food options in Pitt dining facilities, workshops with regional Real Food representatives, and ""Real Food Week"".  Students performed calculations to discover how much real food is already on campus through an extensive set of calculations.  These values will be used as a baseline to chart future progress towards the 20% goal.  See http://www.pittnews.com/news/article_3b2d7b32-b559-11e3-b572-0017a43b2370.html

","Pitt's Dining Services reduces the volume of pre- and post-consumer waste in its Market Central dining facility, which is the largest food service facility on campus.  With a commercial-grade pulper, extractor, and food digester, Market Central’s food waste has been decreased from over 900-750 pounds a day to roughly 350 gallons of waste (approximately a 75% reduction).  This system diverts hundreds of pounds of food waste from ending up in a landfill.  The system was originally purchased to turn food waste into organic compost, but the quality of the resulting compost has been found not to be ideal.  The University is investigating additional options for composting on campus. 

Dining Services donates all of its waste cooking oil to Fossil Free Fuel through the Refuel Pittsburgh initiative.  The grease is converted into automotive fuel for use in diesel engine vehicles and machinery.  See fossilfreefuel.com.   

Pitt’s Dining Services also collects pre-consumer food waste from the Posvar Hall prep kitchen which produces a majority of the to-go sandwich, snacks, and other food products sold at campus cafes and convenience stores. This collected food waste is composted by AgRecycle in Wilkinsburg, PA.","At the start of the 2009-10 school year, Pitt's Dining Services removed trays from the  dining facilities that offer all-you-can-eat meals. Not only did this initiative reduce the amount of food waste by discouraging students from taking more food than they could eat (and thus throw away), but it also has reduced dish washing requirements, saving energy, dish detergent, and thousands of gallons of water each year.

Spent coffee grounds from the Oakland Bakery and Market, the university's on-campus bakery, are also made available in small, biodegradable bags to students and community members for use in their gardens. The majority of the spent coffee grounds from this location though are collected by student volunteers and donated to a local vermiculturist. On average 40 pounds of spent coffee grounds are recovered from this location each week. Read more about the ""Grounds for Growth"" program here:  http://www.pc.pitt.edu/dining/sustainability.php  

In 2015, student volunteers from the service group Food Recovery Heroes (a local chapter of the Food Recovery Network) began food recovery in Market Central and the Oakland Bakery. The students recover on average 51 lbs of food each week and are planning to expand their recovery efforts across campus, working alongside Pitt’s Dining Services.","Nearly all food and beverage packaging on Pitt's campus through Dining Services is biodegradable and compostable, made with sustainable materials like plant fibers, potato starch, biopolymers, and recycled materials.  In addition, the University established the BYO[Bag] (Bring Your Own Bag) program that aims to reduce single-use plastic bag consumption on campus through a $0.25 bag fee for students.  Since implementation last year the BYO[Bag] policy has resulted in a 90% reduction in plastic bag consumption on campus, down from 15,000 plastic bags per week.","The University's ""dine-in"" facilities use reusable plates and utensils.  To-go meals are packaged in biodegradable, compostable packaging.  See also BYO[Bag] description above.
","When members of the University community use a reusable mug, Pitt's Dining Services offers a $0.25 discount on hot beverages. This incentive prevents countless disposable cups from being discarded and demonstrates to students that reducing waste is better not only for the environment but also for their wallets.","The main produce distributor for Dining Services, Paragon Monteverde, is dedicated to supplying local and organically grown fruits and vegetables.  

Eco Lab Apex Warewashing Systems are used in all Dining Services facilities to wash flatware, utensils, and cookware, reducing chemical waste by 30%.

We do not track these by weight.  Approximately 3,800 items are collected and reused or resold through Pitt's Surplus Property department annually.  The values provided for weights of these materials were estimated at an average of 75 pounds per item.  Items in this program range from furniture and computers to vehicles.

Our vendor, Waste Management, is on site to help sort materials properly, provide temporary bins, and weigh the sorted materials. The 

We are fortunate to have professors in both Geography and the Environment and Environmental Studies integrate the waste audits into their coursework. The audit outcomes inform student projects and presentations. During RecycleMania, we have conducted waste audits in the Forum, a central outdoor location, each of the last three years. ","The University recommends buying Environmentally Preferable Products (EPP) -- products or services that have a lesser or reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared with competing products or services that serve the same purpose. EPPs take into consideration: Performance, durability, the ability to be repaired, natural resource use and waste reduction, recyclability and recycled content, biodegradrable materials, and toxicity.

The green procurement guidelines state a goal to follow the Cradle to Cradle concept of buying products that are sustainably produced and can be easily recycled, reused and re-purposed. The University prioritizes products that use environmentally safe and healthy materials, use design for material reutilization, such as recycling or composting, promote the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, have efficient use of water, and include strategies for social responsibility.
","The sustainability office manages an office supply exchange, which is open to all offices and student groups who wish to donate surplus supplies or pick up free supplies. In addition.

Surplus furniture is managed through Events, Conferences, & Support Services. Gently used office and meeting room furniture is available for use in offices on campus. ","All course catalogs, course schedules, and directories are made available online.  Hard copies of the course catalogs are not available. Hard copies of the University directory are available for a fee. A committee on greening commencement has taken the lead on examining print v. online communications, reducing program booklets (based on previous year leftovers), and condensing print-based outreach to one mailing. ","Students are given a limited amount of print credits each semester. Full time undergraduates are limited to 400 pages a semester, part time undergraduates are limited to 200 pages, and law school students are limited to 350 pages per semester. All limits on printing apply to public printers on campus such as computer labs, classrooms, and libraries. Once students use their print credits they have the option to purchase additional print credits for a small fee. 
","The Big Yard Sale is a materials management event designed to capture discarded items during student move-out for reuse via an end-of-year community sale. Each year during spring move out, the Office for Sustainability and the Falls of the James Group of the Sierra Club, in collaboration with University facilities staff and student groups, collect reusable goods that have been discarded and/or donated for the sale. The collection effort begins a few weeks prior to graduation as students begin to move out of the residence halls. 

In an attempt to stem the tide of materials discarded at one time, a 40-foot trailer is located on campus for item storage. Two weeks before the final exam period, bins are placed in laundry rooms across campus for students to deposit yard sale donations. Volunteers from the campus groups place signage near the bins and get the word out about the sale.  Custodial staff transport materials from the collection areas to the Goodwill trailer on campus. Throughout the collection period, Big Yard Sale volunteers also gather abandoned items from the dumpster areas. 

The University of Richmond provides Millhiser Gymnasium as a host site for the Big Yard Sale. The Falls of the James Group manage all volunteers and oversee the sale. Donated and and scavenged goods are brought into the gym, sorted and cleaned, organized by categories on tables, and priced inexpensively. On Friday evening, generally one week after graduation, University staff, faculty, and students take advantage of the ""Preview Sale."" Community residents come to the sale on Saturday morning. All unsold goods are donated to Goodwill, which in kind provides the 40-foot trailer and clothing racks for use during the sale. 

As a result of the sale, the University of Richmond promotes a culture of waste reduction and material reuse, saves on disposal costs, and fundraises for the community. Hundreds of people come to campus to purchase clothes, electronics, appliances, tools, and more at very affordable rates. ","Banners used for events, athletics, and wayfinding are stored by Facilities. When enough banners are collected, they are used as raw material for upcycling.  We currently have banners going back ten years to 2006. ",Each semester the University conducts promotes a bi-weekly trayless dining day and conducts food waste comparisons. We find that the food waste is one-third to one-half less on trayless dining days than days when trays are used.,The University has a pulper that composts pre-consumer food wastes. This goes to a compost collection site managed by the Department of Corrections. ,"In 2015, Heilman Dining Center continued its efforts to reduce food waste with ""Trayless Fridays."" Students from the organization Greeks Going Green marketed the program with signs designating the day as trayless and by conducting a food waste audit. All food waste was separated from non-food waste at the return-tray window before guests exited the building. The food waste is then weighed and recorded. In general, trayless Fridays generate about one-third to one-half of food waste compared to days in which trays are used. 
","Heilman Dining Center has a reusable to-go container program in which students pay a one-time $5 fee for the reusable container at the cashier's station. Student can fill up the container (up to 28 ounces) with food and can take additional fruit/desserts as well. To-go beverages may be had with use of the ""lug-a-mug"" that is distributed to all meal plan students at the beginning of the year. Participants are asked to rinse out the container prior to returning it to the Heilman Dining Center for a new, clean container. Dining Services washes and sanitizes the returned containers.",Dining services has ceramic plates and metal serving ware for all in-house meals. ,"University Dining Services has sponsored the ""lug-a-mug” program for a number of years.  At the beginning of the year, mugs are distributed to each student who has a meal plan. These mugs allow students the benefit of taking a beverage from the dining room and offer  a discount in on-campus retail operations. (Consumers using their “lug-A-mug” can purchase a large beverage for the price of a small beverage.	) These mugs encourage re-use over single-use, disposable items.

Goals include maximizing surplus operational benefits to UW-Stout campus departments, providing opportunities for reuse of surplus items by UW-Stout campus departments, providing opportunities for the general public to purchase surplus property at public sales, providing a centralized recycling location for all types of batteries, printer cartridges and e-scrapping,  a responsible environmental steward for the campus by finding reuse and recycling markets for surplus property, and attempting to create a ""zero"" waste surplus operation. Departments are allowed to reclaim property for use every Wednesday.

The UW-Stout Surplus Store is open for public viewing and sales every Thursday.","The university's default is to not print catalogs and schedules.  The directory is available online or in printed form.  In addition, most instructors utilize D2L for course materials rather than printed versions.  UW-Stout also has a pilot program for e-textbooks.  ","The library and the Service Center in the Memorial Student Center are the only generally-accessible printing option and is a pay-per-print service. Dormitories have printing available for residential students. 
 
All other computer labs are departmental and have individual procedures for students. For example, the Art department provides printing and manages it independently. In departmental labs where printing is limited, students are required to bring their own paper or are restricted in access to the printers by IP address. ","University Housing and the Sustainability Office host an annual event called ""Spring Move Out"" which helps students donate their belongings to those in need with help from Dunn County United Way, Stepping Stones Food Pantry, Dynamic Recycling, the City of Menomonie, and Advanced Disposal.",No new strategies have been adapted.,"University Dining staff record any food items that are thrown out by them, along with the cause of the product waste.  These are reviewed by the production managers in each unit.  During the academic year, select weeks are picked to gather these lists and actually cost out the waste from the back of the house (pre-consumer).  This data is kept on record for these weeks and compared to the inventory usage for these weeks to see what percentage of waste is.  UDS does not include any unusable food product such as the tops of pineapple, rind of a melon, etc.  This helps UDS to keep staff alert to ways to avoid waste and be more conscious of what causes waste.

This supports Vanderbilt’s ongoing efforts to lower costs while enhancing sustainability efforts by using recycled products.

Office supply orders require a $25 minimum order. This change eliminates 988 pounds of shipping waste per quarter, further contributing to Vanderbilt’s commitment to sustainability.

Also in 2014, a new policy was implemented expanding the use of Cintas confidential paper collection bins to facilitate paper recycling. The Cintas collection bins now accept all paper (confidential and non-confidential). All paper securely collected from Cintas is immediately shredded, pulped and recycled.

","Vanderbilt has a surplus department that collects discarded equipment, office furniture and other items for resale on campus. Vanderbilt also has an online “Vandy FreeSwap” initiative to allow students, faculty and staff the opportunity to give their items away to others on campus. 

The Vanderbilt Surplus program is used to dispose of unwanted, Vanderbilt-owned items. After items are collected by surplus, they are either: donated, sold, or otherwise recycled or disposed of. Surplus items that can be redistributed through Vanderbilt are handled by Vanderbilt Procurement. This includes items such as: furniture, office supplies, office equipment, etc.
","Vanderbilt course catalogs, schedules and directories are available online. Printed copies of the Undergraduate Catalog are available on request from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Catalogs of the Graduate School and post-baccalaureate professional schools of the university are available on request from the dean of the appropriate school. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/catalogs/undergrad/ 

In 2009, Vanderbilt stopped automatically printing hard copies of the phone directory for all staff. The phone directory is now only available online through Vanderbilt People Finder. https://phonedirectory.vanderbilt.edu/cdb/ 
","VUprint, Vanderbilt’s pay-for-print service, is designed to provide convenient, cost-effective and sustainable public access printing to students, faculty, staff and eligible guests at a variety of locations across campus. All public access printers in libraries, most computer labs and common areas use this system. Most libraries on campus are set to default double-sided printing.

Vanderbilt also implemented in 2015 the Campus Smartprint initiative. Every department is charged a per page fee for every color print they make. In 2016, changes will expand to include black and white prints. Students have been charged for every page they print for multiple years. This new initiative will have a direct impact on Vanderbilt University’s office paper purchases. 
"," Vanderbilt has a robust move-in and move-out waste reduction strategy. During move-in, extra recycling bins are placed around campus and in addition to normal recycling collections, cardboard, plastic film, packing materials, and molded Styrofoam are also collected. Water bottles have been completely eliminated during move-in activities in favor of eco-friendly, recyclable cups and large coolers of water placed around campus. In 2015, 38.7 tons of cardboard recycled. This equaled a 4% increase over 2014 and a 476% increase since 2007.  Cardboard crew also recycled 2 large box trucks of plastic film, Styrofoam and packing materials. Collection of cardboard at Move-In over the past seven years has resulted in nearly 400,000 pounds of cardboard recycled, which has saved over 46,000 cubic feet of landfill space.

During Earth Friendly Move Out, Vanderbilt’s Office of Housing and Residential Education (OHARE) sets up donation locations across campus benefitting a variety of non-profit charities. Students can donate many items, including clothing and old textbooks, at any of these locations or post them on Vandy FreeSwap. In addition to donating, there are many convenient locations for recycling common items on campus. Electronics, tablets, computers and appliances, such as refrigerators, can be placed in the specially designated areas outdoors around the residence halls that are set up only during move out. For ink and toner cartridges, batteries, and pens, markers and mechanical pencils, recycling is available year round at the Sarratt and Commons Center main desks. Battery recycling is also available at all Reeve desks. For more traditional recycling items such as plastic, paper (including textbooks), aluminum and flattened cardboard, students are encouraged to use the residential recycling areas located next to their dumpsters rather than throwing items away. Vanderbilt also has award-winning recycling videos (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXoHg7lHPyzt-wK9p_pZ8A) which instruct students on how to properly recycle items from their residence halls. Maps and descriptions of all recycling locations can be found on the SustainVU website (https://www.vanderbilt.edu/sustainvu/what-we-do/waste-and-recycling/)
","A scrap metal collection program was implemented in 2014. In two years, 530 tons of scrap metal were recycled. Also in 2014, Vanderbilt donated 35 tons of wood chips to the TN State Parks Department to be used on walking paths. The wood chips resulted from downed tree limbs and debris on campus. ","Vanderbilt chefs and management team work very hard to ensure that there is as little waste as possible.  This is accomplished by analyzing sales figures, by time of day, day of the week, month, previous trends, peak business hours, etc.  Waste is eliminated on the front end by effectively managing our food purchases.  When there is leftover food, it is donated to Second Harvest Food Bank. 

For the past three years, Vanderbilt has donated 2 truckloads of strawberries leftover from the annual Strawberries and Champagne commencement event to the Nashville zoo animals as well as rescued native wildlife at Walden’s Puddle.

We also offer various recycling drop boxes around campus for recycling rechargeable batteries found in various electronic devices. We recycle 100-200 pounds a year through a local company out of Pennsylvania called Call2Recycle that recycles the batteries through RBRC (Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation).

Both audits examined food and non-food waste, with a focus on contamination rates between waste, recycling, and compost. In the audit in the Retreat, the audit of compost bins showed which items are the common source of contamination and allowed the Committee to develop new signage for the dining area. In the audit in Cushing dorm, special attention was given to food waste so as to consider whether starting a dorm composting program would be effective.

The audits are based on samples of dumpsters and grouped into building categories for comparison from year to year. ","Wartburg College has adopted a Campus Sustainability Plan, which identifies goals, divided into eight sustainability categories. The second section, which addresses purchasing, and includes a vendor code of conduct. Part of the code includes several waste related points, such as Waste reduction, Packaging reduction, Use of recycled and recyclable materials (products, packaging, shipping materials), and Reduced paper usage (including e-procurement). 

The purchasing section also includes goals specifically addressing Source Reduction:
     a. Departments shall purchase products with a minimum of 30% Post Consumer Waste (PCW) recycled content for paper products or, at the minimum, EPA standard for other products or bio-based materials, when available and practical.
     b. Departments shall consider vendor packaging in their decision, with a preference to that which is minimal, reusable, contains a minimum of hazardous and non-recyclable materials, and meets or exceeds the recycled material content levels in the U.S. EPA Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines for Paperboard and Packaging.
     c. The College shall reduce the use of disposable products by specifying and purchasing products that are reusable or refillable whenever feasible and practical.
     d. Departments shall work together to order items in bulk when they can be shared or split whenever feasible to decreasing shipping impacts and potentially costs.","REUSE(D) allows students, faculty, and staff to donate or pick up lightly used office supplies. The program is meant to serve as an alternative to buying new materials such as binders, office organizers, and scissors. It also hopes to prevent individuals from disposing of items that could still be of use to someone else.","Our institution does not print the course catalog, schedules, and directories. We have made a very purposeful effort to enhance our website to support these publications digitally. The course catalog website, found at http://catalog.wartburg.edu/, provides all the information in the catalog, and can be updated regularly, instead of printing addendum catalogs. The schedule can be easily searched at https://my.wartburg.edu/ICS/Academics/Academics_Homepage.jnz?portlet=Course_Finder. The public portion of our directory, including faculty and staff, can be found at http://www.wartburg.edu/directory/. We also have a secure directory, which is easy to search, with photos and student contact information that can only be accessed with Wartburg College credentials. There is no printed version of these materials. ","Wartburg does not have any amount of free printing. Part of the fees charged to all students allow for $30 worth of printing per semester. If students use all of this allotment before the conclusion of a semester they are charged standard printing costs of the print and copy center on campus.

There is a discount for printing two sided, and all campus printers are defaulted to two sided printing.","Orange Move Out is an effort to reduce unnecessary disposal during the move out process. Donation stations are in each residence hall and movers are asked to place all reusable items there. Those items are then taken to Goodwill. 
In 2014 we added more move out awareness by encouraging students to give or sell their larger items to incoming students through a ""yard sale"". This raised money for a student group while diverting waste from the landfill.",,"For a week in November 2014 the main campus kitchen participated in a waste diversion study. We collected all waste that could be composted or processed through a biodigester, and measured it by weight and volume. This was the first phase to measure feasibility of food waste diversion.","     Dining Services has begun implementation of a comprehensive food management system that includes menu management, production service records, forecasting based on past recorded use, recipes that are standardized to the serving, and recording left-over food in order to improve forecasting the next time around. While these practices were in place in the past, they were manual. Thus, the various processes used did not electronically “speak” to each other, and staff doing forecasting were required to pour through pages and pages of notes and use their personal recollection. Dining has already noticed that there is less waste, and less food left at the end of a meal (because staff are counting carefully, and thus, noticing it more). Actual dollars spend on food last year was actually less in dollars than the previous year. This is a direct result of the better forecasting and less waste that is inherent with this system.
     This new method of managing the menu and production is specifically designed to decrease food waste via controlling inventory, ordering, production and leftovers.","Wartburg’s cafeteria (The Mensa) went tray-less during Earth Week in 2008. This practice has saved thousands of gallons of water and has reduced the amount of water, chemical and food waste by thousands of pounds since its implementation. ","No, Warburg’s health department inspector has said that they would not be favorable to that option due to health code violations it would cause.  We believe this should not be applicable to us as we can not violate health code.",Our student dining facility uses reusable service wear. We have chosen to not use compostable service wear for retail dining and dine out operations as we do not have access to compost it. It would not be a sustainable decision to purchase a more costly product to just send it to the landfill. ,"Customers who use reusable mugs instead of disposable cups for fountain drinks and coffee receive a discount. The discount gets better the larger the container because it is $.99 for refill no matter the size, but scaled cost for disposable containers.","     Food that is left, and is of appropriate quality is offered a second time.
     Staff are not allowed to take any food home, decreasing incentive to have left over food.
     Pre-consumer food waste such as egg shells, rinds, cores, etc. are collected and composted. This has been going on for over two years. Dining services makes most food from scratch, which means there will be unusable food waste, but it is not going out through the disposal and garbage systems.",http://www.wartburg.edu/sustainability/waste.aspx,--

In 2012 this class audited the College's general waste stream (including primary materials, paper, plastics, organics, and durable goods such as electronics) and in both 2003 and 2008 this class conducted an audit of the College's greenhouse gas emissions. 
Estimates of collected trash by tonnage is taken from four compactor locations on campus and while we do not have exact measurements for solid waste production over the past few years, we rebid our waste contract in 2014 and haulers were required to provide actual weights of all waste production for data usage in order to win our bid. Further, dumpsters are continually checked for items that could be recycled and/or reused.",,"Office furnishings, as well laboratory equipment, old residential furniture, and other reusable goods are reused or donated. Our Distribution Center acts as a holding area where college personnel can obtain items. As much as possible all other useable items are donated.  Much of what we dispose of is donated to local non-profit organizations. Also, the copy center collects paper that has only been used on one side and creates notepads out of this recycled paper.
","Everything is offered online, although some are still printed out if requested.","Papercut ( a software program which manages common printing) has significantly reduced the consumption of paper and toner for printing.  Duplex printing and copying copying is strongly encouraged and all-black printing is the default. All computers which can be printed from in the Student Center and Libraries have standard reminders about responsible paper use and students are given a limited number of printing credits each year, which can be reset upon request, but which forces them to keep their paper usage in mind before they choose to print. ","Every year in May since 2010, the Office of Sustainability has provided large bins and staffs extra custodial staff to each residence hall for students to donate dorm items that they are unable to bring home with them. Instead of being thrown in the trash, these items are donated and/or resold at the Sustainable Move-In Sale to students moving back to campus in the fall at a fraction of their retail cost. Items that are sold include containers, furniture, refrigerators, lamps, hangers, electronics, beauty supplies, books, bags, school supplies, home decor, games, kitchen supplies, and more. All proceeds of this event go towards sustainability projects on campus and items which are not resold are donated to charities in the area: clothing is sent to the Big Brother Big Sister Foundation in Boston, and toiletries are sent to Rosie's Place in Boston, a shelter for female victims of domestic abuse. All items at the end of the sale that are not sold are donated to Safe Haven, a halfway house in Boston. Tons of items are collected to be resold, reused, and/or donated every year.",Where possible all useable items re reused or donated. ,We track both pre consumer and post consumer food waste daily as part of our composting program.,We track and compost pre consumer food waste daily and log it. We receive deliveries 6 days a week in order to minimize spoilage and waste. Food is prepared in an on demand way as much as possible which provides better meals and limits food waste.,"We are a trayless dining program. We also customize plates in order to minimize waste. We plate everything in smaller portions so students can try a little of everything instead of wasting a larger sized portion. We consistently modify our menus throughout the year to meet student needs. If we see that a menu item isn’t popular, we remove it from the menu.",All disposable containers are compostable and are collected in our compost program. ,All dining halls have reusable service ware. At any of our events that are outside of the dining hall and in our retail locations we use compostable paper products which can be composted in conjunction with our food composting program.,"Yes we do offer discount for those who use reusable mugs. If you come to one of our 3 retail operations (Emporium, Collins Café, Leaky Beaker) you get an approximately $ .30 cent discount on your coffee. (ex. Large Starbucks Coffee (non refill) = $1.74, Large Starbucks Coffee (Refill-Reusable Cup) = $1.44)
Also all the brands of coffee that we offer (Starbucks, Peet’s Coffee and Tea and Pura Vida) were chosen due to their commitment to developing and maintaining sustainability initiatives. In addition, all of our coffee brands are fair trade and put a heavy emphasis on producing the most high quality product without interfering with their environmental responsibility.","We began an awareness campaign called Project Zero Waste. The idea of it is to get students to realize what impact they can have on waste reduction. We measured students waste from week to week. Whatever amount in pounds they were able to save we bought that amount in pounds of food to donate to a local charity.

Our waste hauler provided us with a 3-ton recycling credit early in 2014, but it is not clear how that figure was derived as it was not based upon actual collected weight of recyclables. ","We have conducted several ""trash sorts"" to gauge the success of our recycling efforts. One was a public demonstration on the campus quad titled ""Away"", in which all the collected trash and recycling from the residence halls over a weekend was piled in one location. Clear trash bags and blue recycling bags were opened, sorted and separated, visually demonstrating the amount of ""mis-cycling"" happening. The second trash sort was a collection of one morning's trash/recycling pickup from office areas; the Introduction to Sustainability class conducted this sort in full view of passersby.","Our office supplies contract with Staples has a $50 minimum order limit, which encourages bulk packaging; Staples itself has corporate packaging minimization protocols. We purchase office papers in one bulk shipment and recycle all packaging. Information Technology works with its suppliers to bundle computer equipment purchases to reduce packaging waste; several of the manufacturers have take-back packaging programs including Toshiba, which takes back and recycles printer toner cartridges.","We maintain two reuse programs: the Bargain Basement is a reuse area, open to all members of the campus community, in which excess items (clothing, housewares, room furnishings, costumes, arts & crafts, trade books) can be placed for free exchange. The Bargain Basement is accessible 24/7. 

The RUMPUS Room (ReUsable Materials, Paraphernalia, and Utilitarian Supplies) is a free exchange closet for office supplies. RUMPUS Room is accessible 24/7. ","Most departmental forms are available online through the GLOBE intranet - many are fill-in-able PDFs that can be emailed when completed. The multifunction printers on campus have full scanning and email features, so FAXes can be sent and received as email attachments. Moodle, a courseware platform, is used by many faculty to house course syllabi and other course materials, including readings and assignments. Student work created electronically can be uploaded to Moodle for grading instead of requiring submission of hard copy papers.","Students utilize the PaperCut system to print out documents; they have a set allotment of copies they can make; once that allotment is exceeded, they are charged. All networked printers have a duplex function to reduce the amount of printed paper. ","In 2015, Wells conducted its first Trash2Treasure move-out collection, diverting at least 2/3s of a ton of textiles (clothing/bedding) and other reusable materials from landfill trash. Most items were donated to local reuse entities (King Ferry food pantry, thrift store, Finger Lakes ReUse). We re-ran the move-out collection during December, to divert additional material from students graduating early or studying abroad in the spring semester. We did not employ any mechanisms to actually capture weights of the diverted material; we will resolve that issue in spring 2016. ","The Center for Sustainability director approached the Communications department about two modifications to campus letterhead papers and envelopes. In past, all departments and programs ordered custom-printed letterhead with their respective name and location; when that custom imprint information changed in any way, that letterhead stock became unusable. The Center proposed that, except for high-profile departments requiring imprinted letterhead (Advancement and the Office of the President), all other departments and programs utilize generic letterhead stock (also saving on the custom imprint costs!) and include their department information in the body of the document overprinted onto the letterhead. In addition, the Center director noted that the letterhead standard featured left and right margins at 1.5""; she recommended moving those margins out to 1"" left/right, offering substantially more ""white space"" on each page for document text - this practice hopefully eliminated the need for a number of second pages. The new letterhead being purchased features those reduced margins. ","Members of the Campus Greens (student organization) have conducted dining hall ""weight the waste"" demonstrations.  ","Wells Dining is a contract food service operator, and the costs for containers, hauling, tip fees for landfill trash, recyclables, cardboard, and waste cooking oil generated from their operations is paid BY their operation, so it is in their interest to reduce any and all waste from dining operations. Dining staff do not currently track the amount of pre-consumer kitchen prep waste being generated, but they are now collecting that compostable material separately, in advance of the College finding a way to ""close the loop"" for compost processing. ","As mentioned elsewhere, Wells Dining has collaborated with the campus to establish a post-consumer waste separation station that collects compostable food products and paper napkins from trash or recycling. We have not yet established a mechanism to weigh that collected food waste separately from landfill trash, into which it is combined until we ""close the loop"" on compost hauling and processing. Wells Dining has done an exceptional job of integrating waste reduction strategies: being ""trayless"" for several years, exclusively offering reusable dishware and utensils, and bulk service of condiments. Almost all sources of possible contaminants in the compost stream have been eliminated. Wells Dining eliminated disposable beverage cups in the dining hall, which had been a source of problems both in the dining hall itself (students would take disposable cups instead of reusable glasses or cups) and in the waste separation stations across campus when materials were mis-cycled. ","In Fall 2015, the Center for Sustainability and the Environment, the Office of Student Leadership and Activities, and Wells Dining collaborated to issue all members of the campus community (staff, faculty, students) with a reusable beverage container. Wells Dining eliminated disposable hot beverage cups from the dining hall and only offered free beverage fills to be taken out in the diners' own reusable beverage container. ","Wells Dining exclusively uses reusable serviceware for its ""dine in"" dining program. If/when Wells integrates a post-consumer food waste compost processing program capable of accepting compostable serviceware, Wells Dining is prepared to switch any packaging for the few ""to go"" prepared foods available from their ""Wall of Convenience"" program.  ","The GRIND Cafe, a student run coffee house, offers a 25-cent discount to anyone using their own beverage container. In addition, the GRIND partnered with the Center for Sustainability and the Environment on the GOTCHA card program, an incentive to use reusable mugs. Members of the sustainability-related sustainability programs ""spot"" those using their reusable beverage container with a card redeemable for a free beverage refill in the bearer's reusable beverage container. ","The Well, the new pub on campus, utilizes paper-lined reusable plastic baskets and reusable plastic tumblers for its food and drink service. ",--,--

Students, staff, and faculty sort through waste and recycling from residential and administrative/academic buildings to determine the building level waste and recycling rates. The Student Green Team then produces a report that is posted on the sustainability web site that shows the actual recycling rates as well as the potential recycling rates. ","WPI faculty and staff are encouraged to consolidate orders, make use of electronic or CD-ROM catalogs, and buy only what they need. Further, WPI gives preference to products that are durable, reusable, upgradeable, and recyclable or compostable. ","WPI has surplus inventory for equipment and furniture that it reuses on campus, gives to employees, and donates to local school districts and non profit agencies in and around Worcester. We do not monitor the weight of surplus items that are recycled in this way but it is likely in excess of 15,000 pounds. ","WPI encourages the use of online resources.

Chartwells dining services also measures food waste generated per person in Morgan Commons Dining Hall as part of its ""Project Clean Plate"" program.  ","Dining operations' food waste initiatives include TrimTrax, a waste stream auditing system for service kitchens. ","All dining locations on campus are trayless, including Morgan Hall, the Library Cafe, and the Goat's Head Restaurant. The trayless dining has decreased food waste substantially, Also, Project Clean Plate is a nationwide program that began on the WPI campus. The program is designed to reduce food waste in all-you-can-eat campus dining operations and provides awareness about international hunger to students. The program solicits help from student organizations to encourage peer-to-peer waste education. Food waste is monitored at the disposal area and an estimate of waste food is posted weekly, educating students about preventable food waste.

The students who were participating in the Great Problems Seminar were supported by Professor William Baller with the goal of making a difference to Worcester families in need. Worcester-based Holy Cross and Becker, as well as Nichols in Dudley are also members of the Food Recovery Network, which is dedicated to getting extra food from dining halls and other campus eateries to local food shelters and pantries. The national organization comprises 150 chapters at colleges and universities, where students have been rallying to waste less and give back to the community. According to a posting on the group’s Web site in mid-September, participating schools had recovered a total of 860,000 pounds of food since 2011",http://www.wpi.edu/about/sustainability/materi04.html,--
