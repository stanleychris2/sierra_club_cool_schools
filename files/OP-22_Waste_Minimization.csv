Over ten different dumpsters were sampled and contents were weighed. The waste audit was further described in an honors thesis by Hallie Kennan '12. ","Whenever possible, Bucknell specifies products that are durable; made from recycled materials; made of materials that can be recycled; made with materials that require less raw product (e.g. seat cushions are often a mesh material instead of thick foam); delivered in cartons with minimal packaging.

On large orders, Bucknell requires the installer to recycle the packaging.

Our bottle-less water coolers do not require plastic jugs.  Since we don't need delivery of bottled water, there are fewer delivery trucks on campus.","Each summer Bucknell coordinates a supply swap for campus departments. Individuals can pick up recycled items and save their department budget dollars by finding supplies at the swap. Items typically include folders, binders, and plastic organizers.

Two times a year there are open sales of items that no longer have value to the University but still may have value.  The sales are primarily furniture, supplies and machinery that have been stored in the warehouse to a period beyond its value compared to the value of the storage space.  Procurement runs the sale and funds go back into the Bucknell general account.",,,"Bucknell's program is Hidden Treasures/Pay it Forward.  Office of civic engagement, facilities, and residential education work together to collect residence hall move-out reusable waste.  Last year we collected 2.66 tons of items that were Provided to charities such as American Rescue, Hand Up, Salvation Army and Community aid.

We also make special collection locations and efforts to capture cardboard after residence hall move-in.  ","Bucknell also actively searches for reuse of older used classroom and resident hall furniture to charity programs such as Food for the Poor, Hand Up, local churches, etc.  This in the past has resulted in tractor trailer loads of furniture staying out of the landfill and being reused.

The weighs were conducted by students in a foundation seminar course entitled ""Mindful Consumption."" ","Bucknell University Dining prides itself on the service of fresh ’made from scratch’ food. As a result of this we process all vegetables from scratch utilizing the trimmings (onion skins, broccoli stalks, carrot peels etc.) to create all of the stocks we use for soups. Because of full utilization of these and other production castoff products (beef trimmings, chicken bones etc.) and a fiscally responsible production system we produce little to no usable pre-service or post production waste. 
Three of the primary service areas in our dining facility produce food offerings to order, generating no pre or post-consumer waste. Our primary facility/dining room is open 18 hours a day, 7 days a week. This and our full embrace of batch cooking allow full utilization of food produced.
We operate on an extremely small margin of profitability so serving safe, healthy and fiscally responsible food is our driver. Overproducing and disposing of product is simply unacceptable
","The primary waste produced in our facility is post-consumer waste. We utilize a pulper system which grinds all food plate waste (along with napkins) into a biomass perfect for anaerobic digestion. Before we went tray less we estimate more than 600 # day of this waste was produced and sent to a land fill.
After going tray less we saw a reduction to less than 200 #’s a day of this waste. After finding a suitable partner for composting we were able to compost 13 tons of waste in about 35 weeks of service. Unfortunately the relationship we had with a local farm that was able to utilize this compost ended. We are presently looking at options to continue composting with another partner.
In the fall of 2012 Bucknell hosted author Jonathan Bloom, whose literary focus is the reduction of food waste. After four  educational opportunities (Waste Weighs with guests in our facility’s tray waste being weighed) over the last 2 years we noted a reduction of the 1.5 oz a plate waste a meal we had measured. 
Through a series of student driven classes and informational signage Dining partnered with Bucknell Facilities to raise awareness and reduce food waste.
","Bucknell University Dining has two programs which utilize either a reusable cup (provided by participants) with a .25 cent discount or a reusable fold over Togo Food Container. The coffee cup program is offered in our Retail Operations and the Food Container is offered in the Resident Dining Program.

All napkins used across campus and 6 and 9 inch plates in both the Retail and Catering Departments are fully compostable. Additionally hot coffee cups in the Resident Dining are compostable.

Bucknell Dining and the University Facilities Department were able to fully compost all Resident Dining post-consumer waste for one year. Unfortunately, this program turned out to not be sustainable and although it composted 13 tons of waste, it ended in 2012. We have been (and continue to be) actively seeking a relationship which would continue our composting initiative.
","The resident Dining Program uses china; silverware and tumblers for dine in service for approximately 4000 meals a day. This service ware use is in place in two other locations at lunch daily serving an additional 350 guests.  
 
Retail and Resident Dining takeout meals service ware and containers are recyclable but not compostable.","The ‘BE A RE-FILLER’ Mug Program offers guests the option to purchase a sticker for 1$. The sticker is put on the guest’s own mug and they receive .25 cents off all future coffee purchase while using that mug. This Program is in use in all Retail operations.

The fold over To Go containers sold in Bostwick (the resident dining program) for cost (what dining pays for them). This 5$ charge allows no discount but does come with a card which can be used to borrow a second container if a guest needs to. Participants are aware that the use of the container keeps the recyclable To Go’s out of use.

These To Go Containers are also used as part of our Healthy Supper Club initiative. They are reused for adult/ family meal replacement meal.
","We began Composting in April of 2011 and were able to maintain the process until May of 2012! During that time we were able to compost 13 tons of Post-Consumer Waste! After literally years of discussion and planning, Bucknell Dining was able to find and reach an agreement with a local sustainable farm, Rowse House Farms. As of May 2012 we had provided 13 tons of food waste to their Vermee Compost operation. Unfortunately due to disappointing circumstances we had to cease the process with that partner. We are actively seeking a similar arraignment elsewhere and are hopeful we will do so in the near future. We were extremely excited about this initiative as it allowed us to fully utilize the food left on plates after every meal! Currently we are still looking to develop another partnership which would yield the same results.
                                                                                                                                   We've Gone 100% Trayless!
Fall of 2011 The Bostwick Marketplace became Trayless!   Our program was modeled after those of 100’s of institutions of higher education in the United States and Canada.  In the Fall Semester of 2009 we removed trays from the resident dining program two days per week.  Of the nearly 4000 meals that were served on Tuesdays and Thursdays we estimated 98% were served without trays.  We further estimated a reduction of nearly 150 lbs of tray waste per day from this initiative.  On campuses nationwide, this initiative had proven to reduce water usage, food waste and electricity. Over the summer of 2011 modifications to the dish belt will allowed us to remove trays from use in Bostwick.  

Commitment to Purchasing Local
All of Eat n’ Park Hospitality Group’s accounts have focused on purchasing products and ingredients from local and artisan suppliers for more than a decade. In 2011 Bucknell Dining was able to reach 37% of all purchasing being local. All farms and purveyors, in the Farm Source program, are from within 150 miles of Bucknell.

Biodegradable & Recycled Products
Bucknell University Dining Services supports using environmentally friendly supplies and we are working to limit excessive packaging as well as to fully utilize compostable products wherever possible. The retail dining program utilizes a number of biodegradable to-go containers as well as the recycled paper napkins already in place throughout all of our facilities.  We also offer biodegradable service ware in our catering department.  A large percentage of our marketing materials are printed on recycled paper, also.

Reusable Mug Program
In partnership with the Environmental Club and the Facilities Department Bucknell University Dining Services has developed the “Be a Refiller” Program.  This is a program where for only $1.00, guests purchase a sticker they place on their own 16 oz mug.  This sticker entitles the owner to have a price reduction on 16 oz mugs of coffee at both the Bison and the Library Café.

Retail Sustainability Initiatives
Our Retail Operations have initiated and taken part in a number of partnerships with the Environmental Club and the Facilities Department to offer sustainable catering at athletic events. They also replaced 9 inch foam plates in the Bison with reusable baskets with paper liners.

Dining Sustainability Ambassadors
Starting in the fall of 2008, Bucknell University Dining developed the position of Student Sustainability Coordinator to help define new initiatives important to the student body, and facilitate an ongoing relationship via dialogue with the University. As of 2011, we have renamed the position to Dining Sustainability Ambassadors and have 4 of them working with us; Reilly Price, Olivia Tomeo, Alex Hom and Jessica Ertel.

Food Waste Reduction Initiative
After a visit in 2012 by Jonathan Bloom, (journalist, food waste expert and the author of the book, American Wasteland and the blog Wasted Food) we have held a ‘Waste Weigh’ in the Bostwick Marketplace. This event resulted in the base measurement of 90 lbs. of tray waste being scraped off guests plates at a Friday lunch. With the help of Professor Nancy White’s ‘Mindful Consumption’ Class we have enhanced our servery with signage to heighten awareness of food waste. We intend to hold more Waste Weighs and compare results.  ",http://www.bucknell.edu/x4772.xml,--

We collected data for an eight-week period during Recyclmaina and we used the average amount of waste recycled during that time Recyclemania to calculate our annual average.  We feel justified that, if anything, these numbers are an underestimate for the following reasons:
-Only the main campus's waste is monitored during Recyclemania.  The amount of waste recycled in the residence halls is not included in these numbers. 
-During the summer, the campus continues to be used at full capacity for summer camps, conferences, and summer classes.

307-002: Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Policies
""When purchasing goods and services, Oregon State University will strive to balance short and long-term costs, maintenance, life cycle, and costs to the environment.  Oregon State University is committed to identifying goods and services that have a lesser or reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared with competing goods and services that serve the same purpose.  This comparison may consider raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, reuse, operation, maintenance, and disposal of the product.  Oregon State University is also committed to identifying companies that utilize environmentally preferable products and services.  Companies that are able to supply environmentally preferable products and services (especially post-consumer recycled materials) that meet performance requirements will be encouraged to offer them in bids and proposals.""

This group brings together Campus Recycling, Surplus Property, and University Housing and Dining Services in a coordinated effort to reduce move-in and move-out waste. 

For move-in, Resident Directors/Assistants inform residents of the location of the recycling rooms (located on each floor), and residents receive 1-2 small recycle bins in their rooms. Campus Recycling increases the service rate during move-in to pick-up the increased amount of recycling, particularly of cardboard. Also during move-in, large bins for Styrofoam collection are placed at every hall next to the dumpster and the material collected is recycled.

The annual Res. Hall Move-Out Donation Drive runs May through June. Marketing begins approximately one month in advance of move-out week. Each residence hall room received a move-out kit, which included a door hanger with details on how to donate and recycle unwanted materials, along with bags in which to sort their material in their room. Labeled donation bins were located in every res. hall lobby, along with all the recycle bins. 

While a portion of the donations go to the OSUsed Store to recoup the costs of the donation drive, the majority went to local nonprofits. In 2015, the following donation materials were collected and processed:
    13,268 lbs. of housewares
    9,706 lbs. of clothing, linens and shoes
    7,618 lbs. of reusable scrap wood
    3,358 lbs. of food, toiletries and school supplies

The 2015 total of 33,950 pounds was up from the 23,784 total pounds collected in 2014. Additionally, previous years yielded: 25,979 pounds in 2013, 20,122 in 2012, 17,558 in 2011, and 11,651 in 2010.","Promoting Reusables
Campus Recycling and the Student Sustainability Initiative promote the use of reusables over disposables by coordinating mug swap-outs (finding students using disposable coffee cups and offering them reusable mugs in return for signing a pledge) and distributing durable goods through its outreach efforts (reusable bags, bottles, mugs, cold cups, and sporks).

Fresh from the Faucet Campaign
""Fresh From The Faucet” is a campus-wide campaign that encourages students, faculty, and staff to reduce their consumption of sugary beverages and bottled water and instead make tap water the number one beverage on campus. This is done by posting signs labeling water filling stations, providing funding for water fountain filters and spigots, providing natural fruit-flavored water as a free beverage option at many dining locations, distributing free reusable bottles, and by hosting activities and booths at campus events.

Repair Fairs
The Student Sustainability Initiative and Campus Recycling hold twice-per-term Repair Fairs to foster a culture of repair and reuse over consumerism. The event allows students, staff, faculty, and members of the public to bring damaged items to receive free repairs. Repairs are given by volunteers - who teach attendees how to make future repairs, as well as fix the item - and cover a variety of categories: clothing, jewelry, bikes, appliances, electronics, and housewares.

Master Recycler Course
OSU Campus Recycling co-sponsors (with Republic Services of Corvallis) the annual Master Recycler program for Linn and Benton counties, an eight-week (non-credit) course that covers all aspects of waste reduction. After completing the course, participants are asked to complete 30 hours of volunteer service educating about and promoting waste reduction, much of which is completed at OSU and in the Corvallis community. One of the eight class days focuses entirely on waste prevention.","As of the FY15 performance year, no food waste audits had been recently conducted.","OSU's three dining centers and OSU Catering (operated by UHDS) donate rather than discard any eligible food to our local food share. 

Our three dining centers keep records of the amount of food that is wasted (spoiled or otherwise unusable) as well as the amount of food donated to the local food share. This information is reported to upper management (who can then address issues with staff) and inventory/ordering adjustments are made as needed. UHDS also annually reviews recipes to insure proper portioning. 

One Memorial Union restaurant (Pangea) offers leftovers that cannot be repurposed to their student employees.","No campus eateries provide buffets or ""all you can eat"" options; all charge per item in an à la carte style. 

Campus restaurants offer many items in multiple sizes to accommodate different appetites (3 portion options for salad bars, half or full sandwiches, small or large wraps, small or full pastries, etc.). 

When a dining center hosts conference attendees (attendees from a conference held on campus who receive a meal card as part of their registration), trays are removed so attendees are restricted to only what they can carry by hand.","OSU's three dining centers have a reusable to-go container program, Eco2Go, which students and staff have the option to buy into. As an incentive to buy-in, patrons get 20 cents off each meal when they use the container (so the cost of buying in is paid back over time).  Program info is at http://oregonstate.edu/uhds/eco2go. 

University Housing and Dining Services dining centers provide mostly compostable servingware for to-go items and all three of the centers collect said serving ware for composting. The majority of disposable to-go cups (coffee or soda) served on campus are compostable. Compostable to-go ware can also be composted in departments participating in Campus Recycling's department composting program.","Five cafés and five Memorial Union restaurants do not offer reusable dishes for dining in. However, all three University Housing and Dining Services dining centers along with two Memorial Union restaurants (Pangea and JavaStop) offer all reusable dishes for dining in.
