Celebrating Earth Day on campus is an important and collaborative event that enables fun and promotes awareness around being green and a vast array of sustainability learning concepts. Each year, the campus celebrates Earth Day within the month of April, inviting external vendors to booth and provides interactive activities such as campus sustainability tours, recycling drives, and tree planting/mulching.  Education is the entire purpose of Earth Day.  Interactive activities such as the campus tours include the campus sustainability highlights, highlighting more than 20 points of sustainable interest on campus.  This tour points out highlights such as the solar panels located on top of the Library and The WELL as well as the bioswales throughout campus.  The arboretum guided walking tour highlights the extensive and in some cases rare variety of plants and trees located on campus, with 1,200 of our over 3,000 campus trees located in the Arboretum alone.  The Sacramento Tree Foundation attends Earth Day and teaches how to properly plant a tree including root care, watering practices and benefits of various tree species as it relates to the environment and reducing CO2 emissions.  Staff learn about how to implement their own at-home aquaponics technology to grow their own produce.  This training is provided courtesy of faculty and staff from our Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center (STORC).  A mobile display of aquaponics is put on display with experts on hand to explain how the technology works and how anyone can create it at home.  Other professional development is provided by the external vendors that are on campus for the day to educate about such topics as starting your own garden, participating in community gardens, locating local farmer's markets, what locally grown and organic food means, how electronic waste is recycled, what products are recycled at local facilities, how to save water during the drought, how to reduce your utility bill, and much more.  Vendors typically use visual displays, hands on and interactive components and samples as well as printed literature and hand outs.  Earth Day is open to everyone and ample marketing and advertising is done weeks prior to encourage mass participation, such as the staff Monday Morning Bulletin, which is an announcement bulletin that is emailed out to all staff each Monday.  Earth Day is held outdoors in the heart of the campus (Library Quad) where maximum exposure to the campus community is greatest.",--,--,--

Follow link for details: www.sustainablecampus.cornell.edu/.../ideas-for-a-better-world

In addition to the way in which we help employees live sustainability, beginning in fall 2011 we now offer a 3-hour Management Academy course on Sustainability and show participants why sustainability is important and why it should matter to them. We ask the supervisors who are enrolled in the course to take what they have learned back to their units and institute sustainable practices. We know that each person who acts in a sustainable way has a positive impact on the environment. While our goal is to convert everyone over time, we know adopting sustainable practices starts one person at a time. Examples of past management academy programs is available here:  http://hr.cornell.edu/life/career/management_academy.html

Sustainability has become increasingly important to Cornell. Starting in 2001, when Cornell needed to look for a new venue to host five of its multiple-day leadership development programs for senior leaders and managers and for front-line staff, the RFP Organizational Development for Faculty & Staff (ODFS) sent to various vendors included that sustainability be a requirement. One vendor responded and has partnered with ODFS since that time to offer programs in a space that practices sustainability. On average, for a 5-day program with about 27 attendees per program, because we use washable dishes and compost or recycle the vast majority of food and materials, there is only about one small grocery bag full of garbage and that usually contains about three non-compostable coffee cups participants bring with them on Day 1 of the program. At the start of every multi-day program the owner of the facility we use introduces that for the week we will be sustainable. He asks the group to guess how much garbage they think the group will produce in one week. The group typically guesses 5-6 large garbage bags. We then talk about the importance of sustainability in our homes, at work, and in life in general from electricity to waste and what we can do to make a difference. Also, throughout the programs we talk about personal and human sustainability. At the end of the week the owner of the facility helps us end the program by showing the group the small bag of garbage, again, mostly their coffee cups from Day 1. We share that if all of us make a concerted effort to be sustainable and to practice sustainability in our homes and lives, we will have an impact. We also encourage vendors on campus who host one-day events to offer sustainable products. While it took some convincing in some instances, most vendors now offer sustainability options.

The Office of Sustainability helps facilitate a conversation around best practices among the university faculty and staff through this program. 

Purpose of the Program
•To better understand office behavior and practices on a day-to-day basis
•To foster a discussion about how to improve sustainability on the individual and departmental level
•To improve awareness, build a sense of community, and empower staff to make positive, healthy changes

How it Works
•Offices sign up to participate
•A member of the Green Office team conducts a short, fun workshop with the office 
•At the meeting, the office learns about sustainability challenges, areas for improvement and has the opportunity to ask any questions about sustainability at GW
•At the conclusion of the workshop, the team sets goals for the office
(Sample goal: Increase recycling rates, ensure that all lights are off at the end of the day, set all printing defaults to double-sided)

GW also launched a certification program in 2014, in which offices are awarded a certificate indicating how sustainable they are based on a number of criteria. Offices are are encouraged to make improvements to reach a higher certification level in their annual re-certification. 

Additionally, as part of ongoing GW programming, the Office of Sustainability contributes content to various conference and brown bag sessions. In November 2013, the Office of Sustainability gave a presentation at GW's annual Celebration of Excellence Conference on ""9 Steps You Can Take to be More Sustainable at Work,"" which was attended by close to 100 employees. In 2014, a presentation titled ""Green Living at Home: making your home more sustainable"" was given as a brown bag open to all members of the Division of Operations.

Training for Supervisors:
Employee Services is implementing a training program to strengthen the content knowledge of our campus supervisors and establish a foundation of supervisory skills.

All supervisors are invited to participate in monthly training sessions focused on a specific topic and led by in-house trainers.

At the end of the year, supervisors will receive a certificate reflecting the number of supervisory training hours they completed this year. 
Faculty who supervise staff and staff who supervise students are welcome to participate in the supervisor training series. 

Training for Non-Supervisors:
Employee Services will be sending out communications every month promoting a few pre-selected training videos that all employees are able to take.
