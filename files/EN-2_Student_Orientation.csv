The following are the talking points incorporated into the orientation walking tour that highlight campus sustainability along the tour:
New Student Orientation Sustainable Talking Points:
•	Sac State has two LEED Certified buildings. LEED stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and indicates that the buildings were designed from conception to meet certain standards of environmentally friendly and sustainable building practices.
--The WELL is recognized as a LEED Gold building, the 2nd highest building rating in sustainable construction.
--The American River Courtyard in Housing and Residential Life is also a certified LEED Gold building.

•	Sac State is a Tree Campus USA.
--The National Arbor Day Foundation recognized the University’s efforts towards urban forestation with a formal presentation in November of 2012.
--The University maintains a Tree Campus Committee whose members’ duties include setting the standards for tree care and plantings on campus.
--The honor is good for one year at a time so the campus must maintain those standards and apply annually.
--The canopy of trees help to create a cooler campus, potentially driving down energy consumption.

•	The University’s Grounds and Landscaping Department is committed to striving to plant sustainable plants for all its new vegetation. These include drought-tolerant native plants that require far less water to survive.

•	Throughout campus, you’ll notice our energy efficient pathway lighting. The ‘green poles’ are all induction lighting which offer 100,000+ hours or around 11.5 years of service.

•	Throughout campus you will notice our recycling receptacles. The University currently uses a mixed stream recycling program which means you can deposit into the receptacle for recycling nearly any object that is not wood, Expanded Polystyrene Plastics (Styrofoam), contaminated by food or oils, or contains toxins such as those found in batteries or electronics.
--Please remember that plastic coffee cups ARE recyclable once you have poured out the contents.
--Also, please remember that bringing your own mug is the most sustainable choice and that Java City offers a $0.10 discount, Starbucks offers a $0.50 discount, and Jamba Juice offers a $0.10 discount when you bring your reusable cup to use.

•	One of the greenest spots on campus is the University Arboretum. Boasting some 1,200 trees on a 3-acre site on the North end of campus, the Arboretum also has several attractions including a California Natives section that features many drought resistant plants. A nice place to get away from it all between classes, the Arboretum is open daily from dawn to dusk.

•	We provide several opportunities/facilities here on campus so that you can travel here sustainably:

--UTAPS issues a Carpool parking pass which is not only cheaper per person, but also has designated parking spaces for Carpool participants.
--Part of your class registration fees pays for a Commuter Sleeve which will give you free passage on any of the regularly scheduled Regional Transit services throughout the semester. This includes all buses and light rails.
--UTAPS has also partnered with Zipcars to provide two vehicles for student use. Zipcars are a great mode of alternative transportation in that they are vehicles that any student can sign up to use. In leaving their own vehicles at home, the intent is that there will be fewer vehicles on the road. The vehicles are located near the Residence halls and are available 24 hours a day and for up to 180 miles. The registration form to sign up for Zipcar use is available on the UTAPS website!
--In Spring 2014 a Bicycle Task Force comprised of members of Facilities
Management and University Transportation and Parking Services created
a plan to transform Sac State into a more bicycle-friendly campus. These
changes included three new bicycle compounds with over 400 new
parking spots; two new skateboard towers capable of holding up to 40
skateboards and scooters; and new bicycle traffic lanes throughout
campus consisting of designated ""Pedestrians Only"" zones to ensure the
safe passage of both pedestrian and bicyclist.

•	Sac State has a total of 2,100 solar panels on the roofs of the Library and The WELL with the intention of adding more to other rooftops in the future.
--Library I, II have 1,148 panels on their rooftops and reduce the University’s carbon footprint by 123.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
--The rooftop of The WELL has 952 panels and reduces the carbon footprint by 92.8 metric tons. 
--The panels at The WELL make up roughly 16% of its power.
--Interesting fact: the panels were installed at no cost to the school—the University just purchases the power they generate so student tuition is not negatively impacted at all!  

•	The campus is a Smart Grid, an exciting venture in sustainability!
--By partnering with our local electric utility, SMUD, the University launched a program that will more precisely monitor the way each building uses electricity. Over 80 meters placed throughout campus will allow the University to more accurately pinpoint opportunities to become more efficient in its consumption of electricity.
--Not only will this bring significant monetary savings to the school, but it has already garnered national attention as Sac State has become a model of how to integrate the Smart Grid process onto a campus setting.
--Part of the Smart Grid implementation involved installation of 14 electric vehicle charging stations is available on campus. There are four stations located in Parking Structure 1, seven located in Parking Structure 2, and three located in Parking Lot 1.

In addition to the Zero Waste Dinner, orientation week also features the annual Eco-Fabulous Gathering held at the Electric Garage featuring a “zero waste” style spread for students, faculty and staff. During this event, new students are able to mix and engage with representatives of environmentally focused student and staff organizations and receive additional information on campus greening efforts and how they can become involved in campus sustainability.  Some of the student and staff groups represented at this event are from Sustainable Earth, Engineers Without Borders, Green Practices and the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research.  This past year, the event was a part of a community event, The Craig Street Crawl, where the street was closed down for a festival for our first year students to meet the local business owners and vendors.

Campus sustainability efforts are also shared with graduate students during the annual Graduate Resource Fair, a fixture of graduate orientation week.  Green Practices and the Steinbrenner Institute collaborate on this effort to bring information on campus greening, educational and research opportunities in campus sustainability to hundreds of graduate students during this event.

Incoming Freshman register to attend one of four two-and-a-half day sessions on campus. They then return to campus in the fall for the start of school. 

Sustainability is featured at CI in several ways. During the opening videos shown to all students, a welcome from the Office of Sustainability showcases how students can get involved once they arrive on campus. This video message highlights GW's commitment to sustainability and makes a direct appeal to students to get involved. The Office of Sustainability also partners with orientation organizers to ensure that meals and activities are conducted with sustainability in mind. The Office also provides information to each student in their residence hall room about recycling, water and electricity while they are on campus. 

At the CI Activities Fair, student engagement interns from the Office of Sustainability provide information about programs available to incoming freshmen. There are also tours of campus that highlight many of the campus' green features. The pan-university, interdisciplinary, sustainability minor for undergraduates is also previewed during the majors fair that all students attend.

During Welcome Week (the week prior to the start of classes) similar engagement activities are conducted. During Welcome Week students are encouraged to sign-up to serve as Eco-Reps and learn about the fall Eco-Challenge competition. There are also opportunities to register for green-themed student groups, volunteer in the garden and take green campus tours. Everyone is given a water bottle, to promote the use of reusable water bottles on campus.

Early in the fall term- usually the first week -- a sustainability open house is held at the student center to provide students the opportunity to learn more about sustainability activities on campus. Representatives of organizations related to sustainability (e.g., Green GW) have tables and share their organization's work. Faculty and staff engaged in sustainability also attend to meet students and answer their questions.   ",http://ci.gwu.edu/sustainability,--

For the graduate students it includes a discussion of the Sustainability 2020 strategic plan and a sustainability tour of campus with explanations of heating sources, recycling systems, sustainable transportation options, the campus farm and other areas.

For the undergraduate orientation, the offering is more robust and is described below:
Most of GMC’s “green” orientation activities originated as a student project in 2008 and have since been built on by staff and student workers in the Sustainability Office and Student Involvement office. The current orientation incorporates practices and activities that instill the message of sustainability in new students and introduces them to the values and mission of the College.

Wilderness Adventure Experience--
Before students arrive on campus for the traditional orientation, they are given the opportunity to participate in a group-bonding trip. These  trips take place in the back-country, where LNT (Leave-no-trace) principles are taught and the students engage in community service opportunities. Other trips take place within the surrounding towns as students build relationships with community groups and local businesses. For all of these experiences, community service work plays a central role as a way to emphasize social sustainability.

After students arrive on campus for the start of the fall semester, they engage in a more traditional orientation that includes a number of prominent sustainability components outlined here:

Green Guide--
A Green guide on living sustainability at Green Mountain College (written by a current student) is handed out at many of the following events, and to minimize printing, the guide is also offered online as a flipbook (http://greenmtn.edu/flipbooks/green_guide/index.html). Staff hand out small strips of paper with the url to the guide on them, and show hard copies only as examples.

Compost & Recycling Available at All Events & Meals--
All events during orientation offer composting and recycling receptacles with examples of items taped to the side of the bins in order to teach students what goes into each bin.

Free Sale--
In an effort to teach new students the value of reusing items rather than buying new items, a free sale is held. High-value items from the Free Store and Freepo (our two reuse stores) are highlighted in a higher traffic area so that new students are tempted to check out the reuse stores. Sustainability helpers lead these students to the stores to pick out what they need for their residence halls.

Sustainability Table during Check-In--
The Sustainability Office (including the director of sustainability and Green Job Corps workers) sits at a table exclusively dedicated to sustainability. They give out flyers on various sustainability practices on campus as well as the url to the Green Guide (to minimize paper use). Additionally, high-value
items from the Freestore and Freepo are featured at the table to pique student interest in visiting these reuse stores. Information on sustainable transportation options on campus are also handed out, including Go Vermont, Zipcar, and the Green Bikes program. Other sustainability related presentations include representation from our local bus system and the audubon society. 

Family and Friends Session--
The director of sustainability attends the family and friends session and speaks to parents about how their students can take advantage of the sustainable transportation options on campus. He passes out copies of the bus schedule (which students can ride for free), gives out discount codes for use of Zipcar (the car sharing program), explains how students can register for the free online carpooling tool Go
Vermont, and answers any questions or concerns parents have about alternative modes.

Commuter Meeting GMC Coffee House--
The director of sustainability attends the commuter meeting to discuss sustainability systems on campus. He also hands out a pamphlet on how to green your commute, whether commuters are driving their cars, thinking of taking the bus, or looking to carpool.

Images Dinner—
First-year students are enrolled in the Images of Nature class, the first core course in the Environmental Liberal Arts curriculum. As their introduction to their new teachers and fellow classmates, the students take dinner-to-go to faculty residences. To minimize waste during this event, water jugs are filled with water to avoid the use of plastic bottles or disposable cups. Students are asked to bring their own
reusable bottle and each are given a reusable to-go container that they can use for future to-go meals taken from the dining hall.  In addition, every undergraduate teaching assistant assigned to each class is given a composting bin and recycling bag to bring to dinner in order to divert waste at the various locations. The director of sustainability eats dinner with the transfer student group so that he can answer questions about waste diversion and anything sustainability-related. 

Orientation Play--
The student play highlights the sustainability culture of Green Mountain College. Topics covered include how composting works on campus and the focus of our Environmental Liberal Arts Curriculum.

Waste Diversion Basketball Tournament
A 3-bin waste station is set up in a high traffic area and new students are invited to participate in a “3-Bin Basketball Tournament”.  Students test their aim and waste-diversion know-how. Individuals pick out which ‘waste’ item goes into which bin and shoot it into the bin for a chance to win prizes. 

Natural Areas & Invasive Species Orientation--
Students are given a tour of the natural areas on campus with lessons on practicing leave-no trace principles so that natural capital can be protected. They are also told about opportunities to help remove invasive species, especially glossy buckthorn and garlic mustard.

Farm and Food Orientation --
Students are introduced to the sustainable campus farm, how to help with the farm chores and how the farm contributes to the local foodshed both on and off campus. Students learn how to process farm produce for items to be distributed through the local food pantry.

Safe(r) Zone Training
Through the Safe(r) Zone training, new students learn how to be a visible ally for queer and LGBT Green Mountain community members. With the Safe(r) Zone training students are provided with the knowledge and information necessary to help those in search of more information on topics related to gender and sexuality.

Sustainability-themed Convocation Speakers--
Convocation takes place the first week of classes. The College has a tradition of selecting convocation speakers who are environmental leaders. In 2015, author and adventurer Jan Reynolds focused on her photography and recording vanishing cultures to preserve their unique heritage for future generations. In recent years, other speakers have included Robert Michael Pyle, butterfly and month expert and the renowned author of 12 books on the natural sciences and Mitch Thomashow, Director of the Presidential Fellows Program at Second Nature.

Students received a graphic novel about sustainability at Middlebury, made by a local artist. 

All freshmen were required to participate in a MiddView trip which were designed to to serve as a time for personal inquiry, exploration, and connection with the local community. The three themes included Community Engagement, Vermont Exploration, and Wilderness Exploration. Examples of trips focusing on sustainable practices included Food Systems in Vermont, The History and Ecology of Lake Champlain, Vermont Farm Tours, Sustainable Architecture, and Alternative Energy. 

In addition, dining services contributed to the cause by featuring local food and having recycling and composting stations present at events. OSI held its annual Sustainability Fair on the sidewalk outside the Franklin Environmental Center at Hillcrest. A student-run Sustainability Workshop educated students, particularly international students, about environmental efforts at Middlebury such as recycling.

The sessions consist of an introduction from the sustainability director and coordinator, and then a scavenger hunt across campus that teaches students where things like bike racks, ZipCars, the co-generation plant, and compost bins are.  

Two orientation groups are also offered that prominently feature sustainability.  These are longer programs, taking place over the weekend and led by the chair of Environmental Science and  Policy department, and the assistant director of the Center for Environment, Ecological Design, and Sustainability.  

Adventures at the MacLeish Field Station:
This program is designed to give you a taste of some of the many activities you can engage in at Smith's 240-acre Ada and Archibald MacLeish Field Station. Join us for a day and a half off campus to learn a little history, learn how to read the New England landscape, and make new friends and build relationships on our low ropes challenge course. Depending on the weather we may do some solar cooking, build habitat for native pollinators and more. Participants should be prepared to spend the day outside and be willing to try new things. This group can accommodate up to 20 students.

Sustainability and an Ecological sense of place:
Perhaps the key issue facing humanity now is how to live in an environmentally sustainable, socially just way. According to one calculation, the average U.S. citizen has an ecological footprint that is five times greater than the planet can support. We need to - and can - do better than that! This program will help you: (1) learn how to live more sustainably at Smith and (2) develop an ecological sense of place in your new home.

Questions that will be asked - and, to some extent, answered - include the following: Where does my food at Smith come from? How and what can I recycle? What powers our campus and how can I save kilowatts and BTUs? Are there green spaces nearby? How can I get to them and to other places without a car? What kinds of environmental majors, minors, and resources are available? Are there active student environmental organizations on campus? And most importantly, how can I make a difference environmentally while at Smith?

Short excursions and activities will give you an ecological sense of place, whether we visit a shady riverside trail or a steamy power plant. You will learn what Smith College is doing well and where there is room for improvement (this is where you come in during your next four years). Professor L.

UMKC is going green, and Residential Life is ready to join in the challenge! In Fall 2009, the first LEED®-Certified building on the UMKC Campus was opened - Herman and Dorothy Johnson Residence Hall. Some of the features of this certification included:

    construction activity pollution prevention
    access to public transportation
    parking space for alternative fuel vehicles
    maximizing open space
    light pollution reduction
    water efficient landscaping
    optimized energy performance
    recycling and reuse of construction materials, and

The largest source of carbon emissions at UMKC is from students, faculty and staff commuting to and from campus. Campus housing plays a large role in decreasing these emissions by providing comfortable housing close to campus. The Residential Life Department supports the goal of making recycling and other sustainability efforts become the norm for the UMKC campus community.
How you can help

The University has taken many steps to decrease our footprint on the earth, but we still need the help of the campus and the community in making Kansas City a greener place. Here’s how you can help us protect the environment:
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle – In December 2009, UMKC reflected a recycling rate of 50% of our total waste. By recycling paper products alone, UMKC has the potential to annually save 7000 trees, 12 tons of air pollution and 3 million gallons of water. Try using reusable cloth bags when going to the store, register online to stop junk mail, avoid products with excessive packaging and buy in bulk.
Conserve energy – Johnson Hall features motion-activated lights in the hallways and windows that offer additional daylight for the breezeways in order to reduce energy usage. Remember to turn off lights and other electrical items when leaving a room, unplug items that you are not using, and take the stairs to avoid using the elevators.
Save water – In the landscaping for Johnson Hall, careful consideration was given to maximize water efficiency, in addition to water reduction strategies used in the construction of the building. Don’t leave water running while brushing teeth or washing dishes, take short showers – every minute you take off your shower time saves three gallons of water – and wash only full loads of laundry (not much of a challenge for the average college student!).",http://www.umkc.edu/housing/sustainability.asp,--

Additionally, the Sustainability and Environmental Management Office participates in a resources and information fair, which is attended by all first-year students during orientation.  All first-year students must participate in a semester-long environmental seminar series, and educational information on sustainability is left in each first-year students’ residence hall room.

At the beginning of each school year, information sessions are held with all Resident Advisors, who then disseminate information to their constituent residents.  All student desk workers in The Commons Center and Sarratt Student Center also receive a brief lesson in sustainability initiatives on campus.

A student organizations’ fair is held each fall to introduce new and returning students to service and organizational opportunities on campus, including those focused on the environment and sustainability.  Incoming freshmen also participate in Commodores in the Community, a full day of service to organizations at Vanderbilt and in the Nashville community.  Past projects have assisted the Vanderbilt Biodiesel Initiative, the Sustainability and Environmental Management Office, and local community gardens. Additionally, the EcoDores program is a peer to peer sustainability educational program that organizes activities and events to get students in their residence halls actively engaged.

First-year students also participate in a program called “Vanderbilt Visions”, which contains presentations with a sustainability theme. Vanderbilt Visions is a key component of an educational program in The Ingram Commons that encourages first-year undergraduates to be empowered and responsible members of the Vanderbilt University community.

“Visions” is a one-semester, university core program that begins during CommonVU week and meets weekly until Thanksgiving break. All first-year students are assigned to one of 92 Visions groups, which connect students from all ten Houses of The Commons and all four undergraduate colleges. Teams of upperclass peer mentors and faculty members (Student and Faculty VUceptors) mentor these small groups as they explore the transitions all experience moving from high school to university life. A syllabus organizes hour-long meetings, but provides groups significant autonomy to chart their own course. SEMO has provided sustainability education modules that are used by the Vuceptors during their Visions courses.

Efforts to reduce waste generated during first-year student orientation and move-in are made wherever possible.  Rather than purchasing bottled water, students, families, and friends are encouraged to bring their own reusable water bottles that can be filled up at water cooler stations throughout The Ingram Commons during move-in.  Plastic, aluminum, cardboard, paper, and molded Styrofoam recycling have also been incorporated into first-year move-in operations and events.

The Ingram Commons Cup - Just as Hogwarts has its House Cup, The Ingram Commons has the Commons Cup with ten individual first year Houses competing against each other in academics, intramural sports, House involvement, community involvement and sustainability. The Commons Cup is awarded at the Commons Carnival on the last day of classes. Students in first-year houses compete against each other to conserve as much energy as possible in their own House each year. Each month, the ten residence Houses’ electricity usage data is sent to The School for Science and Math, a joint venture between Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS), which offers high school students a four-year, interdisciplinary, research-centered learning experience. The School for Science and Math calculates the houses with the most energy conserved as compared to the same house the previous year. Points are awarded on a sliding scale, and the points are added to each House’s running total to determine placement in The Commons Cup.

In the Fall of 2013, the College provided all new student leaders in the dorms (collectively referred to as a dorm's ""House Team"") with reusable plastic cups during their orientation preceding the school year. These cups were then expected to be reused during all catered meals during the orientation. The following week, entire dorms were offered cups as a prize for winning sustainability contests during Freshman and New Student Orientation. The sustainability activities included a dorm-wide trash art sculpture contest. This encouraged students to think about waste reduction, promoted reuse, as well as dorm bonding.
