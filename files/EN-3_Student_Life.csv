Evolutionary Mismatch and the EvoS Lifestyle Project. Presentation by David Sloan Wilson and Sudhindra Rao, Binghamton University
Abstract: Evolutionary mismatch can occur whenever a population that is adapted to one environment experiences a novel environment. Only subsequent evolution—or human intervention—can solve mismatch problems. All species can experience mismatch—now more than ever given human-caused global environmental change. Modern human environments are so different from ancestral human environments that mismatches might account for myriad human ills—but documenting mismatches and designing interventions can be very difficult. We will provide an overview of the concept of evolutionary mismatch and describe the EvoS Lifestyle Project, which attempts to understand and address dietary mismatches. Audience members are encouraged to become participants in the EvoS Lifestyle Project.
About the speakers: David Sloan Wilson is a SUNY Distinguished Professor of Biology and Anthropology at Binghamton University and Arne Næss Chair in Global Justice and the Environment at the University of Oslo. Sudhindra Rao is doctoral candidate in Biology and the EvoS Lifestyle project director.

Governed through the provost office, involves students, staff, faculty, and community members, and seeks to educate the community about watershed ecology, and to develop a growing group of people who understand the strengths, needs, and problems affecting the Plaster Creek Watershed. 

We seek to equip people to take action to restore their watershed. Ways we do this include:

Presentations on watersheds, history and issues in the Plaster Creek Watershed, and things people can do to improve water quality in Plaster Creek.

An annual summer workshop at Calvin College. We consider topics such as the theological foundations for environmental stewardship, and review the basics of watershed ecology. This event also includes a chance to tour the creek and participate in restoration activities.

We host an event each spring and fall, which includes a presentation on Plaster Creek and opportunities to participate in on-the-ground restoration work.

Research

Students in a new biology class are gathering water quality data, including flow rates, E. coli concentrations, and more. These data will be used to track changes in water quality over time. We are also gathering data on the early history of the watershed, and record oral histories from community members who have lived or worked in the watershed.
On-the-ground Restoration

Most of our events include some form of on-the-ground work in the watershed. Examples of this include installing rain gardens, stenciling storm drains with 'dump no waste' icons, restoring native vegetation along the creek, and planting trees and wetland plants in tributaries to the creek. Practices that use plants to stabilize soil and filter runoff are essential to improving water quality. We have our own native plant nursery and landscaping initiative, called 'Native Landscapes', which we use to implement many of these projects.

CC Farm Interns (self-governed)
The CC Farm is run by a group of student interns as well as many student and non-student volunteers during growing season. The CC Farm is a self-sustaining, 1.3-acre garden on Wood Avenue, behind the president's house. Since 2008, students have taken the initiative to grow and harvest produce on the land, which is then supplied to the college's food service provider, Bon Appetit, sold to the community for fundraising, or donated to different local organizations. The CC Farm aims to promote a greater understanding and practice of local agriculture and food cycling amongst the community. The CC Farm serves as both a classroom and gathering place for people of all ages, as well as a flagship of sustainability at CC. Recent accomplishments of the CC Farm have included bringing the new greenhouse onto campus and meeting their yearly produce quotas (selling $7,000 worth of food). It is also responsible for organizing several popular campus events including the Harvest Banquet, the Green and Bluegrass Festival, and the Pig Roast. During the summer of 2014, the CC Farm began a farmer's market on Saturdays in the parking lot of Slocum Hall. The market was extremely successful and will be continued next year.

The 2013-2014 campus theme was ""Real Utopias"" and examined to to build sustainable societies and global communities.

The 2012-2013 theme ""Creativity & Courage"" while not having direct connections to sustainability, did have numerous functions with indirect ties to sustainability.

The 2011-2012 theme ""Migrations"" had strong connections to social issues and social justice.

The 2010-2011 theme ""Technology & Community"" had limited connections to sustainability.

Our 2009-10 campus theme, “Consumption” sought to engage the issue of human consumption at both the broadest and most particular levels, including subjects such as food, production, media, natural resources, health and health care, education and distribution of resources. The year-long theme was book-ended with consideration of “Consumption” with two renowned public intellectuals – Frances Moore Lappe and Michael Pollan – who speak to the issue of consumption as it relates to food. Through their work, we explored how food serves as a lens through which we understand complex questions about identity, community, consumption, and power. What we eat, how we prepare and gain access to food, with whom we break bread, and who is included and excluded at the table significantly affect our understanding of these issues. In addition to these keynote lectures, we considered our consumption habits in terms of cultural consumption, the global economy, war and genocide, and environmental sustainability.

""Consumption"" theme:
It may be said that our habits of consumption are mirrors of our selves. As the momentous economic disruptions of this past year have signaled, our future lives will present 
profound challenges, especially as regards the ways we think about and access the resources available to us. Our campus-wide theme in 2009-10 engages the issue of human consumption at both the broadest and most particular levels, including subjects such as food, production, media, natural resources, health and health care, education and distribution of resources.

The 2008-09 theme ""Urbanscapes,"" was created around a couple programs about the ""green city"" and brought a green architect, Sim Van der Ryn, as well as David Rusk, former Mayor of Albuquerque, who discussed economic sustainability in cities. There was a program featuring Karl Sandin's work with Newark on developing urban landscapes that are economically and environmentally viable neighborhoods. In all of these programs, our interpretations of sustainability were broadened to include environmental as well as economic development issues.

In 2007-08, the theme ""Hum|an|imal"" dealt with the myriad relationships between human and non-human animals. Our Opening Convocation speaker, Robert Sapolsky, addressed the sustainability of the Western diet, looking at its effects on us as well as the primates who access it in garbage dumps. He discussed many other things, too, but I know that diet and stress disorders (i.e. the sustainability of our Western lifestyle) came up repeatedly.

During the summers at Duke, prospective students on campus tours view a model Green Dorm Room that displays how live sustainably at Duke and includes a check-list of sustainable items to bring to campus (i.e. bicycle and helmet, reusable grocery bag). The Green Dorm Room was created by student employees in the Students for Sustainable Living program.

Funded by a $500 grant from the  Green Grant Fund,  the room is furnished with approximately 20 sustainable items purchased from Whole Foods Market, Target and Etsy.com, a website that sells sustainable goods made by independent artisans around the world. According to results from Duke's Green Devil Challenge - a monthly effort to promote sustainable behavior at Duke - students at the university average about one metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions annually from dorm room energy and water usage.

Biodegradable toiletries and cleaning products, and a power strip that automatically turns off electronics are some items featured in the room. A sign accompanies each product and explains what the item is and how it makes the room more sustainable. 

Due to a shortage of rooms for residential students, the Green Dorm room is not currently available during the academic year. However, in true sustainable fashion, all items are reused each summer as a highlight of Duke campus tours.

Oxford Sustainability Club
Oxford College’s Sustainability Club is the Oxford campus’ primary source of environmentally friendly programming. The club combines service and education in a social setting to make sustainable concepts more accessible.  Members and non-members alike apply the lessons from these events to their day-to-day lives. This helps promote a lasting culture of environmental responsibility at Oxford. 

Candler School of Theology Creation Keepers
The Candler Creation Keepers offers community for students who want to explore their devotion to God as expressed through Creation care. They are responsible for maintaining Candler's Educational Garden and meet regularly to tend it. They also plan and lead several events as part of Emory's Earth Month celebrations, including outdoor worship services, a preaching pageant, and an alternative transportation breakfast that aims to provide sustainably grown and justly traded coffee and food for students who get to Emory via bike, bus, car-pool, or any means alternative to single-passenger car. They enjoy fellowship over meals made from locally produced foods, and work to promote greater ecological awareness at Candler and in our local congregations.

",http://sustainability.emory.edu/page/1035/Student-Engagement,True,"The Emory Sustainability Vision set a goal to ""include community gardens in the university landscape plan for aesthetic and educational purposes."" Currently, Emory has five active small educational food gardens on campus that highlight sustainability and food, including one garden on the Oxford campus.  These food gardens are maintained by a team of staff, students, neighbors, and faculty, and harvests are shared within each team.  All of the gardens are managed using organic gardening techniques.
Emory’s educational gardens are part of a growing sense of what it means to live sustainably, including:
-Increasing awareness of local food and education about what food crops look like and how they grow.
-Reminding passersby that eating locally reduces fossil fuel use and addresses global warming.
-Offering locales of respite and stillness, spaces to withdraw from the ordinary round of academic life.
-Fostering an awareness of seasons and the bioregion of which we are a part.
-Offering meaningful work that increases attachment to place.
-Educating about ethnic traditions and crops from around the world.
The Educational Gardens are governed by teams of faculty, staff, and students.

Additionally, Oxford College has recently hired a farm manager to run an organic farm across the street from Oxford's campus. Slated to be in full operation by fall 2014, the farm will be used to grow food for the dining hall and community, model the use of sustainable farming techniques to support the local community and to provide education and training opportunities for our students on the issues of sustainability. The farm will produce a diversity of vegetables, as well as orchard fruit, cut flowers and shitake mushrooms grown on hardwood logs.  Lessons from the farm will be incorporated into the classroom curriculum. Faculty from across Oxford will be invited to use the farm as a resource in their teaching. The Oxford farm is not student-governed.

The Student Environmental Fund was created out of a campaign during the fall of 2008 to establish a green fee at Emory University. This campaign was started by Emory's Student Government Association with help from the Emory Environmental Alliance. Emory's Student Government Association (SGA) created a survey during this time that was distributed to the whole student body to gauge support for a green fee. Nearly 2,000 Emory students from across the University participated in taking the survey. Through it, the majority of Emory students indicated that they would be personally willing to give extra money with tuition to increase sustainability at Emory; however, the majority also opposed a new mandatory fee outright for every student. Thus, SGA leaders and campus administration responded by creating the Emory Student Environmental Fund. Money raised by the Student Environmental Fund is appropriated by a committee of students advised by the Director of Sustainability Initiatives. Student Environmental Fund money may be appropriated at the committee's discretion to any project from one of the following three categories:
(1) The purchase of or investment in clean renewable energy in the Southeastern United States;
(2) Student driven projects or services that produce measurable benefits to the environment;
(3) Student Government Association Revolving Green Fund* projects.
Student Environmental Fund projects must demonstrate that they are above and beyond those things Emory is already doing to preserve the environment, and thus, donations will not be offset by reduced spending on environmental preservation by other parts of the university.

It is a project of the student group, The Food Justice Alliance, implemented in partnership with the GW Department of Landscape Design and the GW Office of Sustainability. The group was founded in spring 2009 to ""restore the environment, promote community, build relationships, and pursue justice through food"". The garden was the recipient of a Fulbright Grant for Eco-Leadership and the funds were used to enhance and expand the garden. 

In Fall 2011, the garden received a $20,000 award from a contest put on by Nature's Path to fund expansion and enhancement in the space. Each year since then, over 1000 pounds of food from the garden are donated to a local soup kitchen, Miriam's Kitchen.

Starting in Fall 2013, the GroW Garden is collaborating monthly with the neighborhood Farmers' Market to promote the garden and the benefits of urban gardening at the market. Since the Fall 2014 season, produce from the GroW Garden is now being incorporated into the Farmer's Market's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, in order to increase awareness of the garden in the local community.

The garden is organic and the student gardeners consistently seek out local vendors who can provide them with pesticide-free soil, mulch and compost. 

The Office of Sustainability funds a garden manager student intern position to maintain the space and coordinate student and community involvement with the garden. The initiative is not student-governed, rather is it supervised by the Office of Sustainability.

THE CLIMATE JUSTICE LEAGUE is dedicated to working in solidarity with local, national, and international movements to avert climate catastrophe and transition towards a sustainable world. Those that have done the least to cause climate change are the ones paying for it the most - that’s climate injustice. There cannot be a livable climate without justice and there cannot be justice without a livable climate. CJL works alongside the Five Colleges to pressure their administrations to divest from the fossil fuel industry, as Hampshire was one of the first to commit to doing so. CJL works to block future dirty energy proposals, close those in operation, and lessen the power of the fossil fuel industry. CJL organizes and celebrates with the national Climate Movement - frequently attending rallies, convergences, and protests around the country.

Currently, New Leaf is leading a campaign on campus to eliminate single use plastics throughout all areas on campus. This includes partnering with a local Bag Share organization to offer handmade reusable bags on campus that are intended to be used and shared across campus. New Leaf is working closely with the student-run co-op Mixed Nuts and the Hampshire College Farm to encourage a transition to biodegradable plastics. While actively organizing to reduce single use plastics on campus, New Leaf has installed collection containers for plastic #4 bags/film/wrap in order to recycle those materials properly. 

THE HAMPSHIRE HONEYBEE COLLECTIVE brings our campus into political, ecological, and economic alignment with the interest and well being of honeybees and other pollinators. Partnering directly with the Hampshire College Farm Center, administration, alumni, and surrounding community, the HHC works to insure that we do our part in helping preserve one of the greatest workers in our global food security and general planetary wellbeing.

Growing Farmers holds a Winter Farmers Market, growing, harvesting, and selling produce from October through May at the Hampshire College Farm and in an unheated greenhouse that they manage.

THE HAMPSHIRE ORCHARD TEAM (a sub-group of Growing Farmers Collective) is using Hampshire's campus as a living laboratory by using holistic organic techniques to restore abandoned apple trees to healthy fruit production.

THE COMMUNITY GARDEN group is responsible for the general maintenance and development of the open garden spaces. The group also serves as a forum for skill and knowledge sharing in the fields of ecology, agriculture, permacultural design and many other food related topics. 

GREENHOUSE GROUP: The Enfield Solar Greenhouse is a place for growing plants and food, learning about environmental sustainability, and for events that bring the Hampshire community together. Students who live in the adjacent Greenhouse Mod have always been responsible for the care and upkeep of the greenhouse. Residents are selected through an application process that looks for students who are interested in sustainable living and committed to the goals of the Enfield Solar Greenhouse.

REHAMPING is a student-initiated group whose goal is to involve students, faculty, and staff in the process of space-based transformations. It is their belief that on-campus spaces should reflect the needs and desires of the community as a whole. Their redesign work reflects our philosophy in that many voices are incorporated into our proposals.

HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE NATURALISTS foster stronger relationships between people and their environment. Through weekly meetings, networking, field trips, nature walks, and workshops, they work to get the Hampshire community involved in active learning about the local environment.

The Hampshire College Farm Center is a working farm and thriving educational center, providing agricultural programs for the College, local community members, and area school groups and camps.

The Community Supported Agriculture program (CSA) provides a model of farming directly linking consumers to farmers. With over 210 share members (feeding over 800 people), the CSA provides fresh organic produce to the campus and local community.

From studying animal behavior to agriculture, Hampshire students come from a wide variety of fields to use the Farm Center as a hub for investigating the intellectual, political, and scientific issues surrounding food production.

It consists of 34 acres of farmland, ponds, and pasture with various buildings. The tillable land has been farmed organic for the past several years by a local farmer. The HWS Farm Committee was formed in spring 2014 to help oversee the strategic development of the HWS Fribolin Farm. So far, several classes have focused research and projects on the farm, including, for example, two environmental studies Senior Integrative Experience classes, biology courses, women's studies courses, and other classes. Projects have included the installation of a large high tunnel, growing fresh greens for a local lunch program for those in need, soil research, and growing vegetables for food preparation.

Campus Garden: The Colleges consolidated two student-run organic gardens located on campus into one larger garden plot (45’ x 60’) that’s tended by the Sustainable Foods Club and summer students. The garden was developed out of a senior environmental studies capstone project – managed as a permaculture garden with six raised beds, a spiral herb garden and six cold frames. The HWS Campus Garden is supported by HWS Buildings and Grounds, Finger Lakes Institute, and the Office of Sustainability.

High Tunnel: In 2014, Sustainable Living and Learning Community first-year students installed a 20’x48’ high tunnel at the HWS Fribolin Farm which provided cover for the first fall/winter harvest in 2014. The farm has become a field site for class use, pilot projects, and co-curricular programming.
Service: Since spring 2012, the Finger Lakes Institute has coordinated and led an annual “Wake the Farm” Alternative Spring Break Trip for HWS students to dedicate an entire week of service supporting the local and regional farm community. The mission of the trip is to support sustainable agriculture and become more aware of the local and regional food system. Students are encouraged to create and source that week’s meal plan in the most sustainable, local way possible. In spring 2014, cooking parties prior to the trip were arranged in order to prepare food for consumption in advance. The program is led and coordinated by Finger Lakes Institute Community Outreach Coordinator Sarah Meyer in partnership with the HWS Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning.
The crops grown on the campus farm have received care from student volunteers involved with the Colleges’ Day of Service, Orientation 2014, and students available after hours during summer science research. In 2014, HWS students participated in Day of Service in which they volunteered for the Growing Geneva Together Community Garden program and Geneva Peeps, a local egg cooperative. Among their tasks, students constructed raised beds, a fence, and shed, and distributed flyers to residents advertising the community gardening opportunity.

Tomato Patch Project: The first harvest at the farm was 120 lbs. of tomatoes grown by student interns of the HWS Finger Lakes Institute for use by the Office of Spiritual Engagement’s weekly Pasta Night events during fall 2014.

Greens Growing Project: Through a partnership between the 15 students enrolled in the fall 2014 Senior Integrative Experience class and the Finger Lakes Institute, salad ingredients (greens, carrots and radishes) were grown in the HWS Fribolin Farm’s high tunnel resulting in 12 lbs. of food donated in November 2014 to the local Geneva Lunch Program. 

Grateful Plate Event: Butternut squash, grown at the farm by the Sustainable Living Learning Community (SLLC), was utilized in soup served at a “giving thanks” event in partnership with the Office of Spiritual Engagement, Finger Lakes Institute, Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning, and Intercultural Affairs and the SLLC.

In the fall semester, approximately 56 students took one of four sections of the same First-Year Seminar (FSEM), “Sustainable Living and Learning,” with each section taught by a different faculty member. All four sections meet together once per week for a common experience (e.g. guest speaker, focused discussion, field trip, small project, etc.). As part of the FSEM during fall 2015, for example, first-year students toured the Ontario County Landfill and zero-sort recycling center, giving them the opportunity to find out what happens to garbage after it’s thrown out. The students not only learned about the significance of reducing waste, but also of the integral role the landfill plays in the local economy and community. 
During the spring semesters, students remain in the sections, taking a linked course that extends learning throughout the year to create an integrated, interdisciplinary experience.

We hope that Themesters will be a catalyst for students and faculty alike to move our curriculum and research forward in exciting directions. Themesters should also push boundaries by encouraging us to reconsider old truths and investigate new perspectives. We want to use Themester to promote cross-departmental collaboration and thus to experiment with bridging disciplines and approaches.""

Since its inception, a number of Themester themes have aligned with sustainability-related themes.

2015 - At Work: The Nature of Labor on a Changing Planet. Today we are undergoing a seismic shift in the way we experience our work lives. Accepted generalizations about labor and work have been thrown into doubt by robots, networks, algorithms, and the rise of global finance.  The notion of lifelong stable work for a single employer or even in a single economic sector has all but vanished. Consumerism rather than labor generates our cultural and economic values and self-fulfillment. The relationship between work and leisure has undergone a major transformation. Education, training, and skills can hardly keep up with the ever-changing demands of fluid workplaces. Communication technology has decoupled the workplace as a geographic or social unit from the realm of production and profit and accelerated our perception of time. As unprecedented as the new US workforce is, however, much of the world still works in circumstances difficult to relate to our own, as industrial wage-laborers or in precarious informal economies. Themester 2015 will explore the cultural, technological, and historical legacy, the contemporary significance, and future implications of these dramatic and ongoing changes in the worlds of work. 

2014 - Eat, Drink, Think: Food from Art to Science. This Themester aims to provoke debate and discussion concerning the vast networks of peoples, technologies, and environmental systems that make even the simplest meal possible. Common issues that demand our attention in contemporary times include: What are the implications of state regulation of diet and nutrition for a society founded on a commitment to individual liberty? How much responsibility should the diner or chef bear for the way the food that they serve was harvested or processed? How can we feed 10 billion people without causing irreparable ecological damage, and should we care about how equitably that food is distributed? These and other questions explore the ways in which our representations and consumption of food connects us to our social, cultural, and biological worlds.

2013 - Connectedness: Networks in a Complex World. We link to one another, to the virtual world, and to various environments through networks that exist at all levels of human activity. Networks are more than neutral, random or sterile connecting structures. They can facilitate or deny access to a wide array of resources, and provide real intervention points for social, institutional and global change. Themester 2013 focuses squarely on the role of connectedness as a force in society and in our lives as unique individuals, partners, citizens and members of a global community.  Whether particles, people or policies, human experience is embedded in dynamic streams of networks that shape our very existence.

2012 - Good Behavior, Bad Behavior: Molecules to Morality. Themester 2012 explores the meanings of ""good behavior"" and its counterpart “bad behavior”  in all senses: aesthetic, ethical, adaptive, useful, essential, etc., applied to the realms of the  living and non-living. Our discussions encompass moral philosophy, behavioral biology, the  social sciences, mathematics, law, material science, cosmology, the literary, visual, and  dramatic arts, and more.  All contribute to our understanding of the possibilities and limits of telling good from bad and behaving accordingly. 

2011 - Making War, Making Peace. in what ways are both war and peace implicated by the use of violence to achieve so-called “desirable” results? How does our understanding of wartime violence shape how we imagine “peace,” or vice versa, how might the production of a “positive peace” through efforts like the promotion of human rights, campaigns for nonviolence, efforts at reconciliation, etc. influence the ways in which we cognitively engage the practices and conditions of war? And what are the consequences—intended and otherwise—for how we animate warlike or peace building attitudes and behaviors?

2010 - sustain•ability: Thriving on a Small Planet. The Fall 2010 Themester will catalyze IUB’s emerging leadership in sustainability, providing students and faculty an opportunity to begin the interdisciplinary work needed to create sustainable communities locally and around the world, and creating an educational opportunity for undergraduates that they will carry far into the future.",http://www.themester.indiana.edu/,True,"The Green Room Certification Program (GRCP) was introduced to IU in 2011 through a brilliant collaboration between Residential Programs and Services (RPS), the Residence Hall Association (RHA), and the Office of Sustainability (IUOS). Since then, GRCP has strived to inspire students to experience a sustainable lifestyle of their own making.

The GRCP provides students with the opportunity to reduce IU’s carbon footprint and reinforce a culture of sustainability at IU. The GRCP supports and celebrates every campus-dwelling student who strives to live more sustainably by adopting sustainable habits and choosing to use eco-friendly products.

All students currently living in any of the IUB residence halls have the option to Green Certify their room. Certification is easy: simply complete 20 of the 47 criteria on the Green Room Checklist (however, students are not limited to 20 criteria). By certifying their rooms, students are actively creating a brighter future for the campus and the world. As a thank you for their sustainably-minded decisions, certified students receive a certificate to hang on their door and a free insulated water bottle!

The Academic Year Program sessions employ interns for 10-15 hours a week. Academic Year interns participate in an informal seminar focused primarily on communication between interns. Undergraduate students receive $10/hour for their work, while graduate students receive $12/hour. 

At the end of the internship, the student interns put on a symposium to share their progress.

At the MIT CityFARM, we're rediscovering MIT's roots and inventing the future of agriculture using cutting edge engineering, big data, and network connectivity. With a planet home to 9.6 billion people by 2050, our ability to grow food sustainably at scale will be essential to maintaining global prosperity.

Some ongoing projects in the CityFARM Lab include:

1. Urban Agricultural Systems Research

At the MITCityFARM plant lab we are exploring what it means technologically, environmentally, socially and economically to design industrially scalable agricultural systems in the heart of urban areas.
 
Through innovative research and development of hydroponic, aquaponic and aeroponic systems, novel diagnostic and networked sensing, building integration, data driven optimization and reductive energy design; MITCityFARM methodology has the potential to reduce water consumption for agriculture by 98%, eliminate chemical fertilizers and pesticides and reduce embodied energy in produce by a factor of four. By fundamentally rethinking ""grow it THERE and eat it HERE"" we will reduce environmental externality and contamination, create jobs for a rapidly urbanizing global workforce and ultimately increase access to diverse and affordable nutrient dense produce in our future cities.


2. MIT Media Lab Agricultural Facade Laboratory

The Urban Agriculture Facade takes our existing research in the area and combines it with architectural research on light and spatial dynamics. Whereas most hydroponic and aeroponic systems rely specifically on internal light sources and dedicated space, this project is a unique exploration of how these systems can fit into non-traditional settings - turning them into producers of agriculture. Given the high cost of securing urban real estate, an exploration of what is possible in areas such as this become an important segway into the conversation of the future of urban agriculture. With the help of sponsors, we hope to integrate our vision into the Media Lab and begin construction in January of 2014


3. Big Data/Precision Agriculture

We take the view that a link between urban and rural agriculture is a must if we are to adquately meet our food needs over the course of the next few decades.
 
This project leverages satellite imagery and other large datasets to help farmers in rural areas better manage the quality, hydration levels, and shrinkage of their crops with targeted short messages (SMS) prior to predicted crop failure. The data generated can also be used to help cities dynamically address crop shortages by repurposing existing urban farms.
 
The real benefits are apparent for developing countries such as Pakistan which have had flat crop yields for over a decade despite sustaining almost a 100% increase in population. Combined with floods from the melting of Himalayan glaciers, food insecuriy can plague up to 75% of the population. By democratizing crop conditions and making it available to the average farmer, we hope to push the needle with respect to crop yields.


4. Open Agriculture Initiative

Where does one find good nutritional uptake studies for lettuce? Where does one find data on crop yields in Ghana? This information is extremely opaque and difficult to find. The Open Agriculture Initiative seeks to change that by providing a platform to global researchers to share their data, discuss their findings, and work to advancing the common cause of improving crop yields globally by making all the world's agriculture information open and accessible.

Recent evidence suggests that product innovations, new contract structures, and regulation can be effective tools for overcoming market failures. With public, private, and nonprofit institutions working to increase financial access around the world, the time is right to explore new ideas, expand conceptual frameworks, and collect compelling evidence in order to better understand financial constraints, especially among the poor, as well as the implications of alternative policy strategies.

Waste is annually produced in scales of tons on earth. In 2009, the US alone produced 161 million tons of waste (the weight of approximately 71,500 space shuttles). Reducing and reusing this waste would save resources that are otherwise lost. In developing countries, waste and waste systems most profoundly affect the poorest populations. The 2012 Yunus Innovation Challenge calls for innovative solutions to gaining value from waste, including both systems and technologies for improvements in (but not limited to): solid waste management, biowaste, electronic waste, medical equipment waste, wastewater, and industrial scrap, as well as the well-being of wastepickers and their livelihoods. Solutions should be designed for implementation in communities living at or below the poverty level.

Help raise awareness of waste and of its effects on marginalized communities! The goal of the 2012 Yunus Challenge Art Installation is to raise awareness around the value of waste materials such as cardboard, Styrofoam, plastics, metals, and other objects found in a garbage can. A crucial focus is the impact of waste on marginalized people and communities. 

Students are challenged to collect pieces of waste from their own lives (and/or from their communities) for a week, and to create a thought-provoking project from materials that would otherwise be thrown away. Finalists' work will be installed and presented on the MIT campus from Mon, April 2 – Fri, April 6. The winner will display their work on Thurs, May 3 at the IDEAS Global Challenge Awards Ceremony.

The Garden features short-season heirloom vegetables, medicinal and culinary herbs, climate-appropriate fruit trees and berries, along with native wildflowers and shrubs. Since Flagstaff has a relatively short growing season (103 days), many of the plants are sown from seed in the NAU Greenhouses in the spring and cared for by volunteers until they are ready to be planted in the garden in early June.

The EDGE Fund is administered by a Student Board, which includes a Student Senate Liaison, is supported by a faculty advisor, and is overseen by the Office of Finance and Facilities Operations.

The Fund can support two different types of projects: efficiency loans and sustainability grants.

Efficiency loans are given for projects that have clear and timely financial paybacks into the fund. The efficiency loans are not like a standard bank loan, where the borrower pays back with interest; instead, our “loans” are paid back with monetary savings achieved through efficiency improvements.

Sustainability grants do not have any payback requirements. We expect them to be used without recovering any of our investment. Hence, these funds support projects that increase Oberlin's sustainability but don't produce easily quantifiable savings: example sustainability projects include covered bike racks, a student operated garden, and a community renovation program.

We have these two types of projects because we have have two funding sources. Part of our funding comes from the college administration, which has asked us to only invest in projects with clear financial paybacks (the efficiency loans). The other part of our funding comes from activity fees paid by the student body, which supported using the funding for either efficiency projects or general sustainability projects (the sustainability grants).",http://ocsites.oberlin.edu/edgefund/,True,"The Environmental Studies Program speaker series regularly brings in notable environmentalists to guest lecture in courses and speak publicly.

Community Garden - The Community Garden holds more than forty student spaces that are allocated to individual students who live in PSU's residence halls. The garden features a large wheelchair-accessible plot, shared toolshed, native plant demonstration, and sandbox play area. The garden also has a three-step composting system and the coordinator organizes a variety of garden workshops. *STUDENT GOVERNED* 

Science Research Teaching Center Native Garden – The Environmental Club has managed this native garden since the 1990s. The garden strip runs along an entire city block and is located next to a well-used sidewalk.  The garden features plants that are found in Oregon, signage indicating the names of most plants, a dry streambed, and a nurse log with mosses.

Community Orchard - Stroll through 30+ species of fruit trees or study at the cob bench in our Orchard. This space utilizes permaculture principles to mimic the processes of natural systems. Each year, the Orchard is one of many placemaking sites activated during the city-wide Village Building Convergence. This spring placemaking festival combines community building, art and ecological design. The Orchard is maintained through a partnership with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT). *STUDENT GOVERNED*

Learning Garden – The Learning Gardens Laboratory (LGL) is a 12-acre garden education site located in Southeast Portland that provides K-12, university students and community members hands-on and place-based education in sustainable gardening, healthy nutrition, and permaculture.  Education at LGL supports improved academic achievement, leadership development, and the development of sustainable local food systems.  Established in 2005, LGL exists as a unique partnership between Portland State University, Portland Public Schools, Portland Parks and Recreation, and Oregon State University Extension Service. 

The Learning Gardens Lab serves as model of community-based education focused on a hands-on and practical learning tool: the garden. Through garden-based education and outreach, this site serves Lane Middle School students, PSU students, SUN Program participants, Community Transition School students,  OSU Extension Service horticulture students and Master Gardeners, and more.  

Graduate students enrolled in Portland State University’s Leadership in Ecology, Culture and Learning (LECL) Program facilitate weekly garden-based science curriculum for Lane Middle School students in collaboration with our science teacher partners from Lane. Over 200 Lane Middle School students from diverse racial, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds receive instruction each week; they learn through direct, hands-on experience the process of growing and harvesting food, the science of cooking with whole foods, and the importance of good nutrition and eating habits. Perhaps most importantly, students learn to appreciate the interconnection and complexity of our natural world.

Graduate Assistants from the LSE program also coordinate a Multicultural Family Learning Garden for Lane Middle School families who are learning to grow their own food. In addition, PSU Graduate Assistants and interns harvest produce from LGL and deliver it to Lane Middle School where it is distributed to families who need it through our partnership with the Lane SUN (Schools Uniting Neighborhoods) School. PSU also offers senior Capstone service-learning classes in partnership with LGL including Environmental Education through a Native American Lens, Grant Writing for the Environment, Sustainable Food Systems, and Learning Gardens and Civic Affairs. Additionally, many PSU courses require Community-Based Learning and our site is one where these volunteer hours can be fulfilled. In addition to these educational opportunities, our partners from Oregon State University’s Extension Service demonstrate sustainable, organic gardening techniques at LGL through the Organic Gardening Certification Program, and train and mentor students from the Community Transition Center, a Portland Public School on site, in horticulture. 

Permaculture Demonstration Garden – Along the west side of Smith Student Union, students maintain a demonstration garden which shares ecologically-sustainable land management practices. The garden includes groundcovers, native plants, a pathway, and other ""permaculture-friendly"" plants.

Native American Student and Community Center (NASCC) - This rooftop garden highlights native medicinal plants with ethnobotanical significance to the Pacific Northwest's indigenous communities. Signage highlights historical and contemporary uses of native plants.

Oak Savanna - South of Science Research and Teaching Center, the Savanna includes 5 oak trees and one pine tree. Additionally, the space is home to native plants which include camas, lupine, grasses, poppies, and yarrow. The space is used as an educational classroom and includes a meeting area comprised of 28 tree stumps. Staff in the Student Sustainability Center have created a learning module that is available to the campus for use in their learning activities.

Shattuck Ecological Learning Plaza - This outdoor research laboratory is home to two separate scientific experiments: a series of vertical growing systems (""living walls"") and a steep-sloped green roof.

The vertical growing systems, set at different angles around the southern end of the Plaza, were designed and built by students in the Department of Architecture and the Green Building Research Lab. The walls were outfitted with several planting and irrigation systems by local firms, including Solterra, Nevue Ngan and Tournesol. Through a $40,000 grant from Metro, the regional government agency, and support from PSU, monitoring equipment powered by solar arrays are collecting data to research water usage, storm-water management, temperature and other important factors. Metro’s goal is to utilize and share this research as part of their continuing efforts to promote low-impact development practices throughout the Portland region. What's more, the data collected by the equipment will soon be made available on the Plaza's web site.

The experimental steep-sloped green roof at the northern end of the Plaza is a testing model that will inform the design and planting of a much larger steep-sloped green roof to be built atop the new Oregon Zoo Conservation Discovery Zone. Designed and built by PSU architecture and Green Building Research Lab students, the model in the Plaza features three bays, each with a different sub-structure. One is a steel terrace system designed by PSU students, another includes a commercial-grade substrate, and a third has soil only. A flow meter will provide information about water runoff, absorption and trans-evaporation of each system. The goal is to identify the system that retains plants and soil and allows for maximum absorption and minimal storm-water runoff. This test roof will be monitored for approximately two years before construction of the full-scale building begins.

The Plaza is enhanced by demonstration gardens featuring drought-resistant native and non-native plants, pervious cobblestone paving and innovative seating created by PSU architecture students. Stop by to see these experiments in progress!",http://www.pdx.edu/sustainability/campus-gardens,True,"Green Roots Cafe - The Cafe offers healthy, sustainability-minded food and is managed by students.

By cooperating with all University departments, educating and engaging the campus community, and recommending and facilitating change, Greening Princeton pursues this mission and advocates the University’s leadership in environmental responsibility.

Students United for a Responsible Global Environment (SURGE): 
SURGE’s mission is to combat global climate change by catalyzing the transition from awareness to action, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the Princeton community, and engaging as active citizens to promote changes in policy and legislation. The organization has also hosted the former governor of New Jersey, has worked with the Sierra Club, 350.org and Oceana. SURGE also hosts Princeton University’s fossil fuel divestment campaign.

The Sustainable Fashion Initiative (SFI): 
Dedicated to cultivating a culture of sustainability in the fashion industry that is grounded in the conviction of young consumers to live, create, and shop purposefully. SFI aims to shift the industry mindset towards a conceptual framework that values fashion as a positive visual and tactile representation of self, and as a powerful vehicle for human empowerment and sustainable development around the world. Through their programs, SFI promotes a socially and environmentally responsible understanding of fashion, provides a discovery platform for sustainable lifestyle options, and investigates practices that will enhance sustainability in the fashion industry as a whole.

Greening Dining:
This group has been collaborating with Campus Dining since 2002 in an effort to adopt more sustainable practices in the dining halls. Together they have worked to develop Campus Dining sustainable practices and policies, including increasing organic and local food options, implementing tray-free dining and ensuring that food waste is sent to local farms or composted.



Notable accomplishments of student-governed groups: 
Greening Princeton, SURGE, and other sustainability-focused groups have co-organized an annual Earth Day celebration for several years, the most recent of which was in spring ‘14. Each celebration has student performers, free sustainable and local food, and information about green student causes. Each event was attended by hundreds of students. 

In ‘13/’14, Greening Princeton completed a highly successful mixed recycling pilot and communications campaign. As a result, mixed recycling is being rolled out during ‘14/’15 in all student dormitories. It will be rolled out in 2015 in all faculty and staff buildings. Greening Princeton and the Office of Sustainability will continue to coordinate a communications campaign to educate campus members about the changes to their recycling system.

In ‘13/’14, SURGE organized a campus energy competition, “Do it in the Dark.” The Engineering Department collected baseline energy data for a week before the start of the competition; the competition was not announced during the data gathering process to help ensure an accurate baseline. The competition lasted for a month and was judged by which of the six residential colleges saved the most energy. Alongside the competition, SURGE ran a communications campaign to promote the competition and to teach students about how they could save energy. By Earth Day, the end of the competition, the top three residential colleges saved 11,876 kWh, or enough energy to power 312,538 laptops or 494 Nissan Leaf Electric Cars. 

SFI has hosted an annual Sustainable Fashion Week for three years, the most recent of which was in spring ‘14. This included a fashion show with clothing made out of sustainable materials; free DIY workshops; and speaker panels. 

In 2013, Greening Dining debuted GoViv, a reusable container program that is accessible to customers dining in Café Vivian in the Frist Campus Center. More recently, Greening Dining has added “Food for Thought” signage to napkin holders in dining halls and hosted veggie night+/flexitarian dinners and presentations.",http://sustain.princeton.edu/about/greenleaders,True,"The Princeton Garden project is a student-run initiative overseen by the Office of Sustainability.

TSC is a student-run organization that aims to serve as the center for information about current environmental events on the Tufts campus.  TSC also organizes a popular Sustainability Roundtable each semester that brings together other sustainability-focused groups and interested students from across the campus.  TSC is comprised of several member branches: Tufts Climate Action, Food For Thought, Tom Thumb's Student Garden, and Sustainable Action Squad.

Tufts Climate Action is a group dedicated to building leadership on and off campus and contributing to the climate justice movement.  The group's campaigns have included natural gas, divestment, administration and academics, environmental justice, and agriculture, and members have engaged in activities such as rallying, marching, and demonstrating.

Food for Thought is the Tufts platform for addressing contemporary food issues through a variety of lenses, including environmental, political, social, ethical, economic, and nutritional. Through weekly discussion and mindful action, the group seeks to educate themselves and the community on these issues, inform individual food-related choices, and engage with and improve the food systems to which we are connected.

Tom Thumb's Student Garden on the Medford campus includes a garden plot behind the Latin Way residence hall and is focused on getting students outside, playing in the dirt, and eating real food.

Sustainable Action Squad works on projects to make Tufts a more sustainable place.  The group evolved from Tufts Against Plastic, the student-led initiative to get water bottles out of the Hodgdon On-the-Run takeout location and get affordable Nalgenes into the hands of students.

Create a Better World.” inspires students to take pride in their University and engage in societal change towards a more sustainable world. “Emily”, a fictional first year student and self-professed sustainability ‘nerd’, appeared in all campaign materials and wove together UBC sustainability story from a student’s perspective.  The campaign was communicated extensively through social media, web, digital signage, videos and mass advertising across campus and on high volume bus routes to UBC.

As part of the 2013 campaign, faculties,  units and student groups hosted over 20 Ripple Labs - events that are ‘disruptive’ and create a ‘wow’ moment for students to experience sustainability on campus. Labs highlighted research, focus on behavior change, inspire through art or performance, encourage dialogue, or stimulate action. Examples of Ripple Labs included a Tap Water Taste Test, green building tours, bike tune-ups, a 3D art drawing of a desired subway station at UBC and a Storm Water Theatre Show. Student “Ripple Reporters” were recruited from the UBC Blog Squad to cover specific labs and produce stories of each Ripple Lab which were featured on the Ripple Effect website.  

When surveyed post-campaign:

•	Fifty-nine percent of students from the Vancouver campus who participated in the Open Minds Forum (a quantitative market research platform) said they were aware of the campaign and/or recalled events or activities from the campaign;
•	Sixty-five percent of those who experienced any element of the campaign felt that their knowledge of UBC’s sustainability initiatives had increased ‘somewhat’ or ‘greatly’; and
•	Sixty-three percent of those who experienced the campaign reported being ‘somewhat’ or ‘greatly’ inspired to become more sustainable in their own lives.

    Interested in climate change, public health, global health, or protecting vulnerable populations? Looking for a space to think creatively about developing climate policy or effectively communicating climate change concepts? The Climate Change and Health IdeaLab (CHIL) is a collaboration at UC Berkeley focused on research-sharing and innovation around these issues.
    By bringing together students, researchers, practitioners, groups, and projects, we are reshaping the dialogue around climate change and health; and inspiring new policies to significantly mitigate climate change while protecting the health of the most vulnerable–through innovations in climate models, groundbreaking research on the health effects of pollutants, new designs for more energy efficient technologies, policy analysis on land use, and efforts to more effectively communicate the co-benefits of climate change mitigation.

Common Cause of Berkeley

    Common Cause of Berkeley is a campus group under the umbrella of Common Cause, a national interest group dedicated to making government more open, accountable, and responsive to the public. We are a non-partisan political group that does not directly advocate for policy issues, rather we advocate for simply making government work better. Whatever your particular political goals are, whether it be expanding renewable energy or legalizing gay marriage or increasing access to financial aid, the issues that Common Cause advocates will almost certainly help you achieve your goals by allowing you to work with a government more transparent and responsive to the public and less to wealthy interests. Since we are a student group, we particularly focus on advocating for good government reform that increases the accessibility and responsiveness of government to students.

Environmental Consulting Group (ECG)

    ECG consults with corporations on their corporate social responsibility & environmental educational pages.  The first consulting project is developing a webpage that is interactive, graphically inviting, and apart of an LED market place that is being marketed to millions of Americans. If every light bulb were switched to an LED, the country would save two billion metric tons of C02, equivalent to a year of coal generation within the United States.  The unbiased environmental page will explain what is happening to our environment and share interactive diagrams and graphs that will provide consumers easy to understand knowledge about environmental stewardship.  Each team member will be able to network with leaders of companies; managing directors of banks, global research institutes, and gain experience to advance their resumes.

Fossil Free Cal (FFC)

    At Fossil Free Cal, we know that the fossil fuel industry is both driving catastrophic climate change and harming communities through the extraction and burning of coal, oil, and natural gas. Our campus’s campaign is calling on UC Berkeley and the UC system to divest their commingled and direct holdings in the top 200 fossil fuel companies with the largest reserves of carbon. We expect and demand that the Berkeley Foundation and the UC Regents foster a future of opportunity for their students through not only their programs but their investment practices as well. Investing in climate chaos is not in line with any kind of viable future, and must stop. Beyond the campaigns at each UC campus and the UC-wide campaign (Fossil Free UC), over 500 campaigns already exist at universities, cities, and religious institutions across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, and momentum is only growing.

Since its inception in 1977, the Student Farm has served the UC Davis students and faculty, farmers, gardeners, school children and many others. Its unique program centers around three principles:
A focus on sustainable agriculture principles and practices,
An emphasis on in-field, experiential learning,
The encouragement of student initiative, creativity and exploration.
We have a 7 acre Market Garden that supports a CSA and sales to the Dining Services and Coffee House, and to the on-campus Farmers Market.  We are an example of one form of urban agriculture, in that we are a small farm that is on a campus that is integrated into the town. 16 acres of the Student Farm are certified organic. 

Resident Garden - Segundo Housing Area (program run by Student Housing, garden managed by students)
The Resident Garden at Segundo is a space for all on-campus residents to learn about organic gardening, local produce, edible plants, how they are grown and cared for, and how they can be prepared after harvesting! During the academic year, programs are hosted at the garden to introduce residents to gardening practices as well as teaching residents how to use produce at home and how to continue gardening once they move off campus. The garden also provides opportunities for student leadership and community involvement.

Other campus gardens include the Experimental College Community Garden, the Plant and Environmental Sciences Salad Bowl Garden, and the Good Life Garden at the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science.
",http://dining.ucdavis.edu/sus-garden.html,True,"Founded in 1968, Unitrans is a unit of ASUCD which operates the transit system serving the UC Davis campus and the entire City of Davis. Approximately 250 students are employed, filling all the operational positions (driver, supervisor, dispatcher, trainer), as well as numerous positions in maintenance, administration, and management. Service is provided on 49 buses fueled primarily by compressed natural gas, and most doubledecker buses using biodiesel fuel. Over 21,000 passengers are carried each weekday, and over 3.6 million per year. Students gain tremendous experience relating to many aspects of sustainability in working at Unitrans. The entire enterprise is devoted to providing a more sustainable means of transporting thousands of people each day by using the bus instead of a car. They see directly the challenges in providing service that is convenient and accessible to the community. Maintenance staff is constantly looking at ways to save fuel and reduce use of materials. The ultimate sustainable statement is the continued use of vintage buses which were first built in the 1940s/50s and have been converted to clean diesel or CNG -- allowing them to continue in service rather than having to buy an entirely new vehicle.

The Associated Students--UC Davis, Coffee House is a $4M, multi-platform, break-even operation staffed by 5 full-time and career employees, a handful of student managers, and over 250 student employees. There are seven different service platforms, including a bakery, pizza servery, deli, tex-mex grill, build-to-order salad station and a home-style foods venue.

Aggie Reuse Store (student-governed)
Aggie Reuse Store promotes sustainability and creative reuse by selling used items such as clothes, books, school & office supplies, and housewares, etc. at a low price to students. We hold craft workshops to teach people how to repurpose items available in the store. We are also a resource to students and campus departments to donate their used goods. Our goal is to divert as much waste possible from the landfill and encourage others to reuse.  Aggie ReStore was inspired by the work of Design professor Ann Savageau who collects campus and community waste for use by students in her sustainable design class. Over the last couple of years Professor Savageau has found the amount of materials overwhelming but their creative reuse potential limitless. The graduate students that started the Aggie ReStore hope that salvaging some of these items from the trash will benefit people affected by rising tuition and living costs while also supporting Professor Savageau’s original mission to spread environmental awareness through creative reuse.

Davis Net Impact offers networking and educational opportunities every quarter that bring together current and past classmates while encouraging community involvement. From sustainable business symposia to “day on the job” events, and from community volunteering events to the annual welcome retreat, Davis Net Impact provides members and the GSM community with a wide variety of engaging events every quarter.

The Pantry is a food bank for UC Davis students which aims to prevent students from having access to basic necessities, including food and toiletries, due to financial constraints.

UC Davis Student Farm is an educational site that includes the Ecological Garden and the Market Garden. The Ecological Garden mainly brings in elementary or middle school students that learn about their food, and UC Davis students and interns that learn how to maintain a garden, fruit trees, and chickens.

The Market Garden has a certified organic CSA (community-supported agriculture) basket year-round for UC Davis students, staff, and faculty. Currently, 70 subscribers pay $21/week for a basket every week full of produce grown here at the Market Garden. The Market Garden has also recently been selling more produce to the Dining Commons (mainly Cuarto, who buys around $200 worth of produce/week) and the UC Davis Farmers' Market. Next year, the Market Garden plans to expand past the current 4.5 acres to better accommodate the requests from UC Davis Dining Service. In addition to providing delicious and local produce to the UC Davis community, the Market Garden allows for students and interns to learn about sustainable agriculture as they help harvest vegetables, set up irrigation, sow seeds, and transplant plants.

Project Compost is a student-run organization under ASUCD that teaches people how to compost through quarterly workshops and tabling events. In addition, Project Compost picks up some of the organic waste from campus, including kitchen scraps from the CoHo, fruit from pomology labs, and plant matter from greenhouses, and compost it here on campus (as opposed to having it trucked out of town). Student volunteers help maintain the compost pile, and finished compost is used by local gardeners, such as those in the Domes, Experimental College gardens, or the Tri Co-ops.

An average of 15-30 students attend in each group and students come from both on and off campus. Examples include the Sustainable Purchasing class of the culinary program for the Sacramento Art Institute, UC Davis International Education and Nutrition classes from Japan and China, local high school student programs, and sustainable living classes. Lectures create discussions around sustainability, conscious consumption, and business.

UC Davis holds a variety of major events related to sustainability on a regular basis. Three recent examples include: 
In April 2012, Bill McKibben, a noted author and activist for global warming solutions, came to speak at UC Davis as part of the Capital Public Radio speaker series, and students were invited and encouraged to attend the free talk. In June 2012, the campus hosted the annual California Higher Education Sustainability conference, which includes students, faculty and staff sustainability practitioners across all four systems of higher education in California. In March 2013, UC Davis hosted the Climate-Smart Agriculture Global Science Conference, at which scientists and policymakers from around the world met to discuss and ""analyze how to respond to the threats of climate change to global agriculture while meeting the world's need for food, prosperity and sustainability.""

In addition, students organize activities annually for Earth Week and hold a Sustainability Summit at the end of each school year. The summit features student, staff, faculty, and administrator as speakers. It is an opportunity for all attendants to network, inspire one another, and celebrate their accomplishments in the last year. The Summit supports the belief that we are all equals and need to work together to make a difference in the issue of preserving the integrity of the Earth.

Another annual event held at UC Davis is the Education for Sustainable Living Program (ESLP). The program has created a web of learning and education that has woven itself into the campus and the community. Not only does the program engage students and community members with stimulating presenters, but it also empowers them to do amazing things in the community. The Action Research Teams (ART) allow students to participate in projects ranging from a pedal-powered laptop charger to informational videos about bike commuting to Sacramento. In fact, ESLP projects and participants can be found in many facets of the community and campus. Furthermore, it has given rise to new clubs that enhance student life.

1. ASUCI Garden (also called known as Arroyo Vista or Ants in your Plants Garden):
The primary goal of the ASUCI garden is to provide UC Irvine students an opportunity to learn about the food system through garden volunteering, workshops, and curriculum integration. The garden operates like an urban farm where the garden volunteers and coordinators have global jurisdiction over all the plots. Undergraduate students maintain this garden as a student club. The garden is student governed and open to anyone in the UC Irvine community. Activities include event and workshop planning, publicity, volunteer management, collaboration with administration and faculty, and hands-on gardening. Intern positions are available. This garden is student-governed.
					
2. Anthill Village Community Garden: Originally established in 1985, the garden site is located along Anteater Drive between Palo Verde Road and California Avenue. The garden is a maintained as a Student Club. There are 99 garden plots and 100 people on the waiting list.
					
3. Verano Place: The Verano Garden is an organic garden that exists to provide an opportunity for Verano Place residents to garden a communal setting. It is a place to work the earth alongside fellow residents you might not otherwise meet, and to share gardening knowledge. It is also an opportunity to increase sustainability by growing food locally, and recycle garden green waste and community kitchen waste. Verano Place Garden is student-governed.
					
4. The Palo Verde Organic Garden is a resident-run community garden at UCI's Palo Verde student housing complex. The garden is all organic—so no commercial pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or herbicides are permitted. Membership is open to all Palo Verde residents; it is student governed.
					
Other agriculture-related projects on campus include:

UC Irvine Aquaponics is a student-governed and led project which features the symbiotic cultivation of plants and aquatic animals in a balanced recirculating environment. The project's primary goal is to demonstrate that aquaponics is an economically feasible and environmentally sustainable method for the local generation of food in Irvine, California. Accordingly, our research goals are to define the parameters that optimize aquaponics system efficiency, sustainability, and economy in a university context. With aquaponics, campus food waste promises to be diverted into fish food, which in turn fertilizes the growth of edible vegetables. This closed loop method simultaneously conserves significant water resources while much of California struggles in extreme drought. Finally, UC Irvine Aquaponics is poised to provide structured, experiential learning for UCI students, as well as local elementary, middle, and high school students.  
					
Sustainable Polyculture Project: This project brings together local community members, eco-apprentices, and agroecology researchers to identify what novice growers need to design and grow sustainable polycultures for personal use.  A sustainable polyculture is a mutually dependent group of perennial and self-seeding annual plants designed to thrive with little or no external inputs and provide significant amounts of human resources.  The project’s demonstration site is located at the UCI Arboretum. The National Science Foundation has awarded doctoral student Juliette Norton a grant to develop this project, which is student-governed.
					
The UCI Arboretum is a 12.5-acre botanic garden and research facility located approximately one mile from the main campus. The Arboretum features plants and communities from the California Floristic Province and also has an extensive collection of South African species. The faculty director of The Arboretum regularly sponsors educational tours for students, faculty, staff and visitors to interact with the garden.  

The UCI Shadetree Nursery program is a long-term community partnership that provides shade trees and support for community tree planting projects throughout southern California. The nursery was founded through a three-way partnership among UCI, the Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD), and the non-profit Shadetree Partnership. 

The UC Global Food Initiative aims to rally the broad UC community across a wide range of disciplines to work toward putting the world on a path to sustainably and nutritiously feed itself.  The UC Office of the President, along with additional support from the UC Irvine Sustainability Initiative and Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, has enabled the second cohort of Global Food Initiative student fellowships in which 4 undergraduate and graduate student fellows are pursuing projects in sustainable food systems.

UCI Climate Fellow Kathleen Deck created a performance art exhibition called Conservation through Creation. The concept of bringing awareness to climate change through art was implemented by the idea of letting a section of grass at UCI return to its natural state. This approach was a way to visualize the transition from a simulated environment to an indigenous environment through the act of reversal. This project involved shutting off the sprinklers on a 7,800-square foot section of lawn on Ring Road, between Humanities Gateway and the Ayala Science Library, which resulted in a total appearance failure of the grass in the section. The amount of water, 5040 gallons of reclaimed water per week that is used for irrigation, was updated weekly on the signage visible to the audience. See: http://sites.uci.edu/cthroughc/

In July 2015, UCI hosted the Global Compassion Summit, which was the official world celebration of the Dalai Lama’s 80th Birthday.

At the request of Russ Barnett, director of research and development for the Kentucky Institute for the Environment and Sustainable Development, these students gave their input to design the room as a model of sustainable living on campus.

Turning the students' conceptual design into an actual dorm room was made possible with a $5,000 grant from Arts and Sciences Dean Blaine Hudson.

Certain features distinguish this room from any other on campus. These differences are much more sustainable and aesthetically pleasing:
- The floors are made of bamboo, a faster-growing and more sustainable alternative than wood, synthetic flooring or carpet. 
- One wall is covered in clay, a natural building material which has insulating properties, improves air quality by catching dust, and is easier to repair and maintain. Large windows let in plenty of natural light, eliminating the need to use electric lights during the day.
- A ceiling fan helps regulate temperatures more efficiently.
- A low-flow showerhead and toilet, as well as an aerator on the faucet, has cut water use by about 50 percent.
With high ceilings, large windows and the several distinctive ""green"" characteristics, the room is more like a modern, innovative, energy efficient living space than a typical dorm.

Residents of the model green dorm room participate actively in the Housing Green Committee, act as sustainability leaders within the community, and welcome tours to demonstrate sustainable living principles.

2.  Worcester Herb Garden

Location: Worcester Dining Commons

Groundbreaking: Summer 2011
The Story: Chef Don Sabola started the Worcester Herb Garden in 2009 to have a fresh source for herbs right outside the Worcester Dining Commons. In 2011 after our first sheet mulch of the Franklin Permaculture Garden, the Worcester Herb Garden was given to us to transform and maintain. For this garden, the UMass Permaculture Initiative worked with UMass Dining staff to develop a dynamic herb garden adjacent to the Worcester Dining Commons. The site was designed with chefs’ needs in mind, is easy to harvest by dining staff, is aesthetically pleasing, and improves ecological diversity.

3.  Class of 2012 Berkshire Permaculture Garden

Location: Berkshire Dining Commons
 
Groundbreaking: Fall 2011
 
The Story: The Class of 2012 Berkshire Permaculture Garden is our newest on-campus garden, generously funded by the Class of 2012 Senior Class Gift Fund. Before we did any work on the site, we observed signs of compaction, erosion, and nutrient depletion in the soils. We’re now in the process of converting this formally-neglected site into an ecological haven with rich, fertile soil and lots of biodiversity.

Group Description
We take collective action to reduce the university's impact on the environment and human health.
Group's principal activities, events, or programs:
We work on a variety of initiatives including food, land, energy, and waste issues. We have recently started the West Bank Community Garden through a University Program: Living, Learning, Laboratory. We use weekly meetings to organize our initiatives, brainstorm creative solutions, and network with twin cities organizations. Along with the community garden, we have been heavily focusing on organics recycling efforts with the Recycling Center, Minnesota Student Association, and other groups.
How this group's activities benefit the University community:
We have benefitted the university by using university land engage students in the process of growing food and pollinator habitat. This ultimately has grown a large network of over one hundred Cedar Riverside residents, students, staff and faculty to become familiar with one another and talk inside and outside a professional setting. Organics recycling will greatly benefit the university because compostable materials are worth more than a waste product heading to a land-fill or incinerator.
How this group fits into its categories:
We belong in the Environment/Sustainability category because of our commitment to sustainability.
How to get involved with this group:
Our group meets weekly on the East Bank campus. If anyone is interested in becoming apart of our group, they can contact us at sfors@umn.edu.

Group Description
This group is the official means for students to be involved year-round in the University's student-run organic farm, where they can get experiential education producing sustainable food on the Saint Paul campus.
Group's principal activities, events, or programs:
This group exists to: 1. steward a student-managed, organic, sustainable farm that provides food, a place for community building, multidisciplinary education, research and outreach; 2. increase and facilitate student involvement and leadership of the University of Minnesota Student Organic Farm and provide an official means for students to take part in farm operations and activities; 3. maximize continuity, communication, and documentation between student farm workers and growing seasons; 4. take part in and raise awareness of the broader conversations and communities surrounding urban, sustainable, and alternative food systems.
How this group's activities benefit the University community:
We provide the university community with fresh, sustainably grown produce year-round, provide hands-on experience for students interested in sustainable farming, educate the community about sustainable food choices, and provide empowering information and experiences for those who seek to grow their own food, whether casually or professionally.
How this group fits into its categories:
Although this group could potentially fit into several categories, we chose to categorize ourselves in three primary ways: educational, sustainability, and professional. We are educational because experiential farm education is such a huge part of what students get from being involved with Cornercopia, but also because of our mission to help inform the University community learn about sustainable food. We are a professional group because we provide real on-farm job skills, up to and including managing budgets and business plans. We are a sustainability group because we work to produce and propagate chemical-free food with a positive environmental footprint.

These ideas will be applied to teach sustainability concepts and skills such as systems thinking, planning for unintended consequences, tragedy of the commons, hidden connections (between natural, social, and economic systems), and so on. 

The following courses are First Year Seminars, interdisciplinary semester-long classes designed to engage first-year students in critical thinking and experiential learning on topics related to social and/or environmental justice:

FYS/05  One Person Can Change the World.  One person can make a positive difference in the world.  This seminar shows how that’s happening through a series of readings, Ted Talks, inspired lectures and guest speakers.  By the end of the semester you will develop your own idea and have a plan for changing the world around you.

FYS/08  Nature: Past, Present & Future.  With the publication of Bill McKibben’s The End of Nature, the concept that humans could be separated from the ecosphere of the earth is also ended.  McKibben argues – convincingly -- t that we are major shapers of the ecosphere; our actions impact every square inch of the planet.  And yet, for most of western cultural history we have operated as if humans were separate from the natural world, unable to shape or impact it in any lasting way.  In this seminar we will explore the western tradition of separation from Nature and its consequences for humans and the environment.  Students will read seminal, original works that had an impact on the perception of relationship between humans and the biosphere.  They will use these works, contemporary writings, and personal experiences to construct statements about their relationships to the environment and their own ethical perspectives about how humans should interact with it.

FYS/12  Martyrs or Fools? Heroes of Faith Based Social Justice.  This course investigates the lives and work of individuals who, based on religious values and commitments, have worked for social justice and change in their particular contexts. Through the use of both primary and secondary resources, students will consider some of the “greats” in this area: Mohandas Gandhi, Mother Theresa, Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy Day, Archbishop Oscar Romero, William Wilburforce, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and others. The course will also pay some attention to the work of more local individuals who likely will never be famous for their efforts but who nonetheless have dedicated their lives to the work of social justice and change. The course will include a service-learning option and a site visit to an appropriate venue(s).

FYS/26  You are What You Eat: Understanding Our Food Supply.  Despite major advances in medical science, Americans have increasing rates of obesity and related rates of diabetes, heart disease, and other diseases.  Some say this may result in the first generation of Americans who may not live as long as their parents.  Processed foods and reliance on “junk” food is a major reason for the increases in obesity.  This seminar will examine how our food is made and marketed.  Students who take the seminar will be become better lifelong consumers of food, leading to a healthier lifestyle.

The following themes are comprised of junior-level course clusters that are available to students to meet core curriculum requirements.  While other themes are also options, the following are those related to sustainability:

Cluster 4 – Ethics, Justice, and Society
Cluster 6 - Food Ways
Cluster 11 - Resource Systems
Cluster 14 - Culture and Global Society

The skills/competencies we are working to cultivate include listening, needs assessments, careful use of resources, consideration of the long-term impact of one’s decisions, building relationships, a spirit of service, and so on.
